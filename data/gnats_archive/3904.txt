>Description:
Under WinNT, I would like to be able to install apache my own Apache names service.

I have a need to run separate Apache servers on the same box with different install directiories
and configuration files and still be able to run them in the background instead of a console window. 

Or have command line argument that would start a new Apache server in the background and not 
require a console window to always be open.

Any auggestions,

Example: ...\apache.exe -i Apache(test)
