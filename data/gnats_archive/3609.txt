hello I am not sure if i am writeing to the right place but I am running
apache on a windows system. and I can not seem to get the cgi - bin to allow
users to run cgi scripts i keep geting a child prosses error or a 404 and i
have it set up like this

# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding

# warned.

# Originally by Rob McCool

# Note: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
# instead of backslashes. e.g. "c:/apache" instead of "c:\apache". If
# the drive letter is ommited, the drive where Apache.exe is located

# ServerType must be standalone.

# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP numbers
#   e.g.   www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off)

# ServerRoot: The directory the server's config, error, and log files
# are kept in

#ServerRoot "C:/webshare/wwwroot"
ServerRoot "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/"

# BindAddress: You can support virtual hosts with this option. This option

# PidFile: The file the server should log its pid to
PidFile logs/httpd.pid

# ScoreBoardFile: File used to store internal server process information.
# Not all architectures require this.  But if yours does (you'll know
because
# this file is created when you run Apache) then you *must* ensure that
# no two invocations of Apache share the same scoreboard file.

# ExtendedStatus controls whether Apache will generate "full" status
# information (ExtendedStatus On) or just basic information (ExtendedStatus
# Off) when the server-status Handler is called. The default is Off.

# ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e. use
# "www" instead of the host's real name).
#
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't
understand
# this, ask your network administrator.

ServerName www.webwizardhost.com

# UseCanonicalName:  (new for 1.3)  With this setting turned on, whenever
# Apache needs to construct a self-referencing URL (a url that refers back
# to the server the response is coming from) it will use ServerName and
# Port to form a "canonical" name.  With this setting off, Apache will
# use the hostname:port that the client supplied, when possible.  This
# also affects SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT in CGIs.
UseCanonicalName on

# CacheNegotiatedDocs: By default, Apache sends Pragma: no-cache with each
# document that was negotiated on the basis of content. This asks proxy
# servers not to cache the document. Uncommenting the following line
disables
# this behavior, and proxies will be allowed to cache the documents.

#CacheNegotiatedDocs

# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out

Timeout 300

# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.

KeepAlive On

# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We reccomend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.

MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request

KeepAliveTimeout 15

# Apache always creates one child process to handle requests. If it
# dies another child process is created automatically. Within the
# child process multiple threads handle incoming requests. The next two
# directives determine the behaviour of the threads and processes.

# Don't force a server to exit after it has served some number of requests.
# If you do want server's to exit after they have run for a long time (to
# help the system clean up after the process), please set this to a pretty
# large number - like 10,000. What this will do, is, each child server will
# exit after serving 10,000 requests, and another server will take its
place.

#MaxRequestsPerChild 10,000

# Number of concurrent threads at a time (set the value to more or less
# depending on the responsiveness you want and the resources you wish
# this server to consume).

# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, in addition to the default. See also the VirtualHost command


# VirtualHost: Allows the daemon to respond to requests for more than one
# server address, if your server machine is configured to accept IP packets
# for multiple addresses. This can be accomplished with the ifconfig

# AddLanguage allows you to specify the language of a document. You can

# Redirect allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist in

# clients where to look for the relocated document.
# Format: Redirect fakename url


# Aliases: Add here as many aliases as you need (with no limit). The format
is
# Alias fakename realname

# Note that if you include a trailing / on fakename then the server will
# require it to be present in the URL.  So "/icons" isn't aliased in this

# For example, the PHP3 module (not part of the Apache distribution)
# will typically use:
#AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .phtml
#AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps

# AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers",
# actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
# or added with the Action command (see below)
# Format: AddHandler action-name ext1

# To use CGI scripts:
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl

# To use server-parsed HTML files
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

# Uncomment the following line to enable Apache's send-asis HTTP file
# feature
AddHandler send-as-is asis

# If you wish to use server-parsed imagemap files, use
AddHandler imap-file map

# To enable type maps, you might want to use
AddHandler type-map var

# Action lets you define media types that will execute a script whenever
# a matching file is called. This eliminates the need for repeated URL
#pathnames for oft-used CGI file processors.
#Format: Action media/type /cgi-script/location
#Format: Action handler-name /cgi-script/location

# MetaDir: specifies the name of the directory in which Apache can find
# meta information files. These files contain additional HTTP headers
# to include when sending the document

#MetaDir .web

# MetaSuffix: specifies the file name suffix for the file containing the
# meta information.

#MetaSuffix .meta

# Customizable error response (Apache style)

#  to redirect to local url /missing.html
#ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl
#  n.b. can redirect to a script or a document using server-side-includes.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a basic configuration question and, as we quite
clearly direct before you submit a bug report, if you aren't
sure it is a bug in Apache you should ask on Usenet, which is
the proper place for technical support.

First, it makes no sense to have multiple ScriptAlias directives
for the same vhost (in this case, the main server) pointing
to different places.

Second, the problem is probably your CGI.  If it is an interpreted
script, it has to start with a #! line pointing to the
interpreter.  If not, then it has to be properly executable
and output the proper CGI headers.
