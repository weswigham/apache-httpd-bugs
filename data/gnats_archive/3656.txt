>Description:
1.3.4 claims to use unified configuration file httpd.conf. However mod_info still
looks for srm.conf and access.conf:

GET /server-info yields these errors

httpd: [Tue Jan 12 22:12:14 1999] [warn] [client 192.168.1.2] (2)No such file or directory: mod_info: couldn't open config file /usr/local/www/conf/srm.conf

>How-To-Repeat:

Compile Apache with mod_info, and access the mod_info handler.
