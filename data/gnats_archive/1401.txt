RedHat Linux 4.2 (out of the box)

Linux 2.0.30 #1 Tue Apr 22 10:49:45 EDT 1997 i586 unknown
>Description:
Myself and other RedHat admins have noticed problems occasionally when 
/etc/logrotate.d/apache runs to rotate logs. It does a "killall -HUP httpd"
and ends up sometimes generating "error: cannot bind to port 80" errors.

Subsequent instability of server daemon (due to race conditions?) is
also observed (http requests fail while httpd is still running). ps listing
reveals that the process is taking up an inordinate amoung of CPU cycles
(as high as 92% utilization pegged out)
>How-To-Repeat:
Cannot reliably replicate, but have replicated the problem manually by
running "killall -HUP httpd" from shell prompt. Occurs around 10% of the
time when manually run.
>Fix:
Am trying upgrading to 1.2.4 server. A hack might be to add some sort of delay
between logs being rotated and HUP signalling?

State-Changed-Why:
1.1.3 is not supported any more; it is clearly indicated that
we can't support it.  Complain to RedHat about why they
are shipping an obsolete version.

killall should NEVER be used to restart Apache.  Send the signal only to
the parent.  Please complain to RedHat that they are
doings things incorrectly.

I'm afraid that since the problem is both using an ancient
version and improperly using killall, we really can't help.
Please upgrade to a recent version and only send signals
to the parent.
