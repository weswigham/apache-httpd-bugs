>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP3, Visual C++ 5.0, found also in the binary distribution
>Description:
even after installing the patch for mod rewrite, the activation of the child
program is incorrect. in particular:

rewritemap_program_child is called as
	pid = (*func) (data, NULL);  // alloc.c line 1879
that causes a fault in
        si.hStdInput   = pinfo->hPipeInputRead;  // mod_rewrite.c line 3204
        
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The following fix allow the server to start correctly, and the external filter works OK
alloc.c:
line 1853, add:
	child_info info;	
line 1879, add:
	info.hPipeInputRead =   GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
    	info.hPipeOutputWrite = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
    	info.hPipeErrorWrite  = GetStdHandle(STD_ERROR_HANDLE);
and replace the call with:
	pid = (*func) (data, &info);
