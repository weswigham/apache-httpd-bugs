>Environment:
RH 5.0 Linux, 2.0.33
>Description:
If a module in modules/extra is added and in the Configuration file this is
added with the keyword 'SharedModule' then the build fails. The new Configure
searches only for 'AddModule/Module' in the Configuration file
>How-To-Repeat:
Add 'SharedModule jserv_module mod_jserv.o' to Configuration, copy mod_jserv.c
in modules/extra, and try to Configure/make
>Fix:
It should be simple enough I think.

State-Changed-Why:
No, the Configure script correctly recognizes 
SharedModule (proof: if it wouldn't APACI's
--enable-shared option would not work because
it internally uses the SharedModule directive, too.).
Instead it seems your particular command is wrong.
You say you placed the module into modules/extra/.
Then the line has to read

    SharedModule jserv_module modules/extra/mod_jserv.so

and not

    SharedModule jserv_module mod_jserv.o

(Note the path and .so extension!)
It is documented this way in the Configuration file, too.
Please try out this correct version and give feedback
if it now works correctly for you. Thanks.
