DECstation5000/200 running Ultrix 4.3a (full install).
I have tried with the DEC cc compiler and gcc-2.8.1
>Description:
When I try (with or without enabling extra modules)
        ./configure --prefix=/opt/apache-1.3.9
nothing happens. I get a bit of disk activity and absolutely no screen output
at all. I left it for over an hour, it hadn't made any progress at all (on my
SGI system I got some feedback from configure on how is was progessing).
I cannot find any configure logs anywhere, so I assume it hasn't written any.

apache-1.3.6 compiled fine on this platform (with the fixes mentioned in bug
reports)
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu
or
CC=gcc ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu
