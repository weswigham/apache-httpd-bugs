Check the other problem reports in the os-sunos category, this
has been reported before... and there's a few suggestions and
maybe even a patch id.

 There's a patch from sun which fixes this I believe.  It's definately a
 kernel thing, not an apache thing.  If you search the bugdb for the other
 reports in the os-sunos category you'll find a bunch of other suggestions
 and maybe even the patchid.
