apllication/pdf files won't display in acrobat 3.0 plugin in Netscape 3.0.

If you tell Netscape to launch an external acrobat, it works fine. 
The server is NOT changing the content, only the headers are different (same
checksum from NCSA, apache 1.1.3 and apache 1.2b6).

This problem does NOT exsist in apache version 113 (which doesn't have these
headers), NCSA, or Netscape servers:

etag: "b201-135211-33976960"
accept-ranges: bytes
connection: close


>How-To-Repeat:
put any pdf file on apache 1.2b6, try to view it with acrobat 3.0 plugin
in Netscape 3.01.
>Fix:
figure out which header is causing the problem and turn it off

State-Changed-Why:
The headers are correct.

1. Please upgrade to Apache 1.2.0.  You are using a beta-test
   version which is quite old.
2. Please check problem reports 125, 154, 455, and 504.  We
   believe this issue has already been reported and fixed.

After doing the above, please let us know whether or not
you still experience the problem.
