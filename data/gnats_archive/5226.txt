>Environment:
Windows 98
>Description:
The chunk of code below sees to it that you can't create password files using CRYPT under Windows.  It is desirable to be able to do this to enable .htpasswd files, hosted on *nix systems, to be created in a Windows environment.

#ifdef WIN32
    if (alg == ALG_CRYPT) {
        alg = ALG_APMD5;
        fprintf(stderr, "Automatically using MD5 format on Windows.\n");
    }
#endif
>How-To-Repeat:
On Windows:

htpasswd -d htpasswd userid
>Fix:
Instead of using ALG_CRYPT as the default (and testing for it as above), define an ALG_UNDEF and only set the platform dependent default if the user hasn't specified an algorithm.

State-Changed-Why:
If we had the choice, we would use crypt() on Windows and
not need the whole MD5 thing.  But Windows doesn't have a
crypt() and we can't add one without having export control
issues.

So no, you can not generate crypt()ed passwords from Windows
and there is no plan to let you since then code would be
export restricted from the US.

 If you look, you will see that by default it uses MD5 passwords and only
 has the option to use descrypt.

 I think it can be done with the right paperwork, but there are issues and
 restrictions with that or some such thing.
