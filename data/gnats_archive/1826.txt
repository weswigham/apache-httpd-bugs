>Environment:
NT 4.0 w/SP 3. Apache 1.3b3 built w/debug  Mod_perl 1.07_04 w/debug
Perl 5.004_04
>Description:
The server is running w/-X in debug. In a non-repeatable fashion, it is crashing 
periodically. It is dying on line 117 of http_config.c

    return confv[m->module_index];

m->module_index has a value of 20, which is valid. Of interest is the previous line of code

    void **confv = (void **) conf_vector;

both confv and conf_vector show a value in the debugger of 0x000000, which
I assume isn't valid.
>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot reliably reproduce this error. It is occurring every 3 to 4 hours
with the server handling approx 1.2 trans/sec.

State-Changed-Why:
Have you resolved this problem yet?

Can you reproduct it without mod_perl?  If not, I have
to suggest that it probably isn't related to Apache but
to mod_perl...
