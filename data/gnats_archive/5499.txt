 Update:
 
 [Tue Sep  4 03:56:07 2001] [emerg] (45)Deadlock situation detected/avoided:
 fcntl: F_SETLKW: Error getting accept lock, exiting!  Perhaps you need to
 use the LockFile directive to place your lock file on a local
 disk!
 
 [Tue Sep  4 03:56:08 2001] [alert] Child 6886 returned a Fatal error...
 Apache is exiting!
 
 If you have more than one application running on the server that can cause
 time delays, in one case it was Netegrity Web Agent, Vignette V5 5.6.2,
 Apache can get confused. The fix is to compile apache with
 
 CFLAGS -DUSE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 
 Modify the configure file to include this flag. It goes away.
 (Thank you Sermet Yucel)
 
 Otherwise, don't be proud, rebuild from the OS up.
