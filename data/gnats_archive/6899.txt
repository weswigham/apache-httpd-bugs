>Description:
It appears that a DoS -- or at least a log flooding -- is possible if apache is
configured to display an local, custom error document in response to say, error
404.  The custom error document must contain a <link> tag that in turn contains
a relative href attribute, ie, <link rel=stylesheet href=foo/bar.css>.  If a
request is made for a *directory* that does not exist, an an attempt to access
non-existant-dir/foo/bar.css, which in turn does not exist.  We then wind up with
a request for non-existant-dir/foo/foo/bar.css, which doesn't exist, then
non-existant-dir/foo/foo/foo/bar.css, etc etc until something blows up.

From my access log:

192.168.1.212 - - [27/Nov/2000:15:12:40 -0500] "GET /foo/images/styles.css HTTP/1.0" 404 859

(sorry for any wrapping)

I was using Netscape 4.76 under Linux when I found this problem.  This appears
to in fact be a Netscape flaw (or a combination of Netscape+apache) because
this does not happen with IE 5.0+ wunder windows 2000 (but it does happen with
Netscape under windows 2000).
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Configure apache to display a custom error 404 message:
ErrorDocument 404 /error404.html
2) Construct /error404.html such that it contains a <link> tag with a href
attribute that is relative.  To see the staircase effect described above, be
sure the href contains at least one directory component.
3) From netscape, request a directory that does not exist on the web
server.
>Fix:
The simplest way is not to use <link> in a custom error document.  Otherwise,
the admin should ensure that all hrefs in a custom error document are absolute.
The apache manual should mention somthing to this effect; it should explain to
the user that a faulty custom error document could get apache caught in a loop.
