cc (bundeled)
>Description:
Undefined symbols when linking httpd due to two configure problems:
 :
cc -O -DULTRIX -std ... -o httpd ...
ld:
Undefined:
__ull_div
__ll_mul
__ull_rshift
isinf

1. __*ll_* symbols: long long problem on ULTRIX. AP_TYPE_QUAD is set to 8
   (src/Configure, line 2176), so src/include/ap_config_auto.h contains

/* determine: longest possible integer type */
#ifndef AP_LONGEST_LONG
#define AP_LONGEST_LONG long long
#endif

2. isinf does not exist on ULTRIX but ./helpers/TestCompile returns zero
   (src/Configure, line 2195), so src/include/ap_config_auto.h contains

/* determine: isinf() found in libc */
#ifndef HAVE_ISINF
#define HAVE_ISINF 1
#endif
>How-To-Repeat:
CC=cc OPTIM=-O ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lib/apache
make
>Fix:
Problem 1: Compile all files with "-std1" (src/Configure, line 1477), then
   the compiler will only warn about "long long is not standard ANSI. (3.1.1),
   AP_TYPE_QUAD is set to 4 and there are no more undefined __*ll_* symbols.
   But there is one additional issue with "-std1" (strict ANSI C), see 1a.

Problem 2: No fix yet, but a bit more analysis. The ULTRIX Compiler (cc/ld)
   creates a (non-executable) file, even if there were unresolved symbols.
   This difference to gcc seems to confuse TestCompile.
   Output of TestCompile, with an "ls -l $TARGET" inserted before exstat=0:

# ./helpers/TestCompile -v func isinf
cd ..; cc -O -DULTRIX -std1 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I./lib/expat-lite \
   -DNO_DL_NEEDED `./apaci` -o helpers/testfunc helpers/testfunc.c
ld:
Undefined:
isinf
*** Error code 1
Stop.
-rw-r--r--  1 root     system      17028 May 22 16:28 testfunc
# echo $?
0

Problem 1a: With "-std1", compilation of src/ap/ap_getpass.c fails because
   of a missing "extern char *getpass(const char *);".
 :
cc -c ... -O -DULTRIX -std1 ... `../apaci` ap_getpass.c
cfe: Error: ap_getpass.c, line 191: \
     Type for rhs of assignment expression is incompatible with lhs (3.3.16.1)
     pw_got = getpass(prompt);
 -----------^

Remark: apache 1.3.20 builds out-of-the-box on ULTRIX V4.5 with gcc (2.95.3)
        and gmake (3.79.1). Only one warning:

ap_getpass.c: In function `ap_getpass':
ap_getpass.c:191: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
