>Environment:
Linux 2.3.9-pre5, apache 1.3.12
>Description:
After installing Apache and getting a "Invalid argument: could not call shmget"
message, I found the FAQ qeustion D.5, which advised me to include SysV IPC
support in my kernel.  I already had such support, and in fact had a /proc/sysvipc
directory.  Furthar research turned up the linux kernel advice under sysvipc:
Shared memory is now implemented using a new (minimal) virtual file system, which you need
to mount before programs can use shared memory. To do this automatically at system startup just add the
following line to your /etc/fstab:
none   /var/shm        shm     defaults        0 0
>How-To-Repeat:
On a system with a recent development kernel, attempt to run Apache which the
virtual shared memory system isnt' mounted.
>Fix:
Add more information to the FAQ question D.5, suggesting the above addition to
/etc/fstab (and a mount -a) if /proc/sysvipc exists.
