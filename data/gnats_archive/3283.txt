>Environment:
apache_1.3.3/src/main/util.c
>Description:
Line 855 of util.c in routine ap_cfg_getline():

   cbuf = cp;
   cbufsize -= (cp-cbuf);

This code occurs in the part of the routine that stitches lines together when
a continuation character is detected.  The intent of the two statements is
to reposition the buffer to the start of the next line and decrement the buffer
size by the number of characters input on the previous line.  But (cp-cbuf)
will always be zero, so cbufsize will remain constant.
>How-To-Repeat:
I haven't observed a problem in real life.  Presumably it would only occur in
the case where a directive and its arguments were thousands of characters long.
Or maybe I'm just reading the code wrong.
>Fix:
Reverse the order of the two statements.
