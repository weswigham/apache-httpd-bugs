gives:

Multiple Choices

The document name you requested (/Personal/L.Wood/spacesearch/powered/) could not be found on this server. However, we
found documents with names similar to the one you requested.

Available documents: 

       powered.html/ (common basename) 


Since:
http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/spacesearch/powered.html
exists, the trailing slash screws up Speling catching this correctly.

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/spacesearch/powered/
>Fix:
You've found the document via basename match. You're just not removing the
trailing slash because the basename matches the last directory.

 Minor correction to my initial text (asterisks):
 
 Re: mod_speling/3235: When blah/name.html exists, a request for     
 blah/name/ lists blah*/name*.html/ as an available document. A 
 trailing slash is incorrectly appended in this
 case.
 
 Should be obvious from the example given.
 
 Cheers,
 
 L.

State-Changed-Why:
This is the correct action for the program to take.  Apache
considers the trailing '/' to be PATH_INFO, which is required
for scripts and SSI's.  Because we do not if the file requires
PATH_INFO or not, we can not throw away that '/'.

Thank you for using Apache.

 replace 'blah.html/' with 'name.html/' above. Typo which may affect
 the logic of your reply;  I previously submitted a
 correction to this after my initial report.

 We're running Apache in a reasonably security-conscious way, with
 scripts limited to the cgi-bin tree and with server-side includes
 disabled. 
 
 Since Apache should be aware that cgi-bin scripts are restricted and
 SSI's are disabled, it should also know that unnecessary slashes and
 extraneous PATH_INFO can be safely discarded if so configured, and
 should be able to handle Speling.mod's output with that in mind.
 
 Ergo, for files in the non-cgi-bin part of the webtree, Apache should
 not be appending the slash, and Speling.mod should do the Right Thing
 on e.g.: 
 
 http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/spacesearch/powered/
 
 for the existing powered.html. PATH_INFO can be discarded for this
 configuration and this error can be corrected for a large part of the
 installed base.

 L.

 The spelling module does not know how your scripts and Includes are setup, so
 it can not determine which files might and might not need the PATH_INFO
 information.  In order for the mod_speling to have that information, it would
 need access to mod_include's and/or mod_cgi's internal information.  This
 breaks the rule that modules are separate entities and do not share their
 information.  This would also cause potential problems for people who had
 htaccess setup for directories, because mod_speling would be making decisions
 without necessarily having all the information required to make the right
 decision.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Ryan

 No.  Modules do not communicate with other modules, nor
 are aware of each other's settings.  The spelling module
 has no way of knowing whether mod_include/mod_cgi are
 part of the server or if their functions are enabled or
 disabled for a particular URI.  They could be disabled
 globally but turned on in a <Files> container, for
 instance.  Even if it were possible, if Apache were to
 do the sort of cross-checking you suggest the performance
 would drop by about an order of magnitude.

 No.  Again, mod_speling can have no idea whether the URI it
 presents will, in fact, be handled by the same server.  The
 configuration may have Alias or RewriteRule directives that
 will change how the URI is handled when presented to the
 server, so the spelling module cannot make brash assumptions
 about what it can discard and what it cannot.
 
 You can avoid this behaviour by either disabling the spelling
 module ("CheckSpelling Off") or enabling MultiViews
 ("Options +MultiViews").  Try these and see if they don't
 solve your problem.
