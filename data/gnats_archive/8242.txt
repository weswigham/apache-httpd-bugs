>Description:
When calling TWebRequest.GetFieldByName to get server variable the last character of variable will be lost. The same problem occurs when using other TWebRequest properties, based on environment variables (such as RemoteAddr, URL and others).
IMHO such problem occures because GetServerVariable in mod_isapi returns (in lpdwSizeofBuffer) size of variable value _without_ NULL character, but Delphi thought that this size includes NULL. So, when Delphi doing conversion to string it loses the last character of the value.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I've corrected all 'lpdwSizeofBuffer=len;' to 'lpdwSizeofBuffer=len+1;'. It works fine for me. I don't think this can break anything. It seems that IIS works in the same way.
