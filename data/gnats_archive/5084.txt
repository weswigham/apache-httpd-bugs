>Description:
the andpersand character '&' in a directory name causes improper indentation
in the listings - an example URL is provided below.  As a sidenote, bugzilla
also jams up when doing a search for the '&' character.  If you are reading
this... atleast it doesn't jam up on submissions. :)
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.malign.net/misc/apache-dir-bug/
>Fix:
Either add an extra tab to the output when you see an '&' character in the
directory name, or output in a table-format.  You could also point the finger
@ netscape and say it's a problem with their HTML-parsing and not you guys. :)
