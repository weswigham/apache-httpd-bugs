>Environment:
Irrelevant.  Bug is in your www.apache.org online documentation
for Apache 1.3 httpd  IfModule directive.
>Description:
It would appear the that the documentation for IfModule was written
at an ancient time before the LoadModule and AddModule directives 
came into existence, when modules were active if and only if they
were compiled into apache.  Please replace the stated conditional
criteria if "module_name is compiled into Apache", by something
reflecting the current reality that following a "ClearModuleList"
command, truthfulness for "IfModule" is determined simply by whether
an "AddModule" directive has been executed for the module in question.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at the online documentation for IfModule
>Fix:
Yes - make it clear that the conditional test for "IfModule" is
true after issuing a ClearModuleList if and only if an AddModule
directive is then done for the module in question.  It doesn't matter
whether the module has been statically compiled into Apache or loaded dynamically with LoadModule.
