>Organization:
>Environment:
NT4 SP3 and Binary dist from apache.org  and no uname -a ;^) 
>Description:
I'm coming from 1.3.6 to 1.3.9 ftp'ed on 10/22/99 
The install caused no pb
The test with my conf files is perfect in console mode THEN...
I am able to start apache as a service but it consumes a lot of CPU 
and no answer from the serveur to the browser (either IE ou Netscape) is done
I don't know what is going on exactly.
The test apache -t works perfectly and conforts me in my opinion that my conf
files are not going in trouble with the news version
>How-To-Repeat:
third time i install and unsinstall in all the ways (minimum, complete, ...)
>Fix:
Sorry not to have one

State-Changed-Why:
See any messages in the error log? What happens if you try
to start Apache from the command line? Bring up task manager when you see this behaviour. Do you see an apache
process being restarted?
