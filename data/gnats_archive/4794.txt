I've seen other web servers running the same apache with close to the same config but they do not have this problem, the only obvious difference was that I have the freetype php module installed and the other set up does not. I'm wondering if the freetype module inside of php. Possibly a php problem, I'll post a bug there too but not sure, thought I'd check here too.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install apache 1.3.6 on freebsd 3.x with php 3.0.11 or 3.0.7 with mysql 3.22, imap-4.4, gd1.5, freetype-1.2, and possibly expat, I'm not sure.

Not a clue, thats why I'm here =]

 Hmm, using the same version of FreeBSD, apache and php I cannot quite
 reproduce this. I am wondering, are you doing anything clever in your PHP
 scripts, any clever connections to the mySQL database ? Or anything else
 you would like to tell us about :-)
