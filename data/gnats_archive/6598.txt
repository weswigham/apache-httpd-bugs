>Release:        1.3.12
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 with GCC 2.8.1
>Description:
When setting up a Solaris server to proxy a NT IIS server with both basic and NTLM authenication, the logins are rejected.
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse to an NT IIS server that requires authentication.
>Fix:
If you strip out the NTLM authentication header, basic authentication will be used.  Alternatively, NTLM can be shut off on the IIS server, although the people accessing the server directly will be at a disadvantage.

This involes adding  a new function to "src/main/alloc.c".  This has the same functionality as ap_table_unset, except it matches the value also.

API_EXPORT(void) ap_table_unset_val(table *t, const char *key,const char *val)
{
    register int i, j, k;
    table_entry *elts = (table_entry *) t->a.elts;

    for (i = 0; i < t->a.nelts;) {
        if ((!strcasecmp(elts[i].key, key))&&(!strcasecmp(elts[i].val, val))) {

            /* found an element to skip over
             * there are any number of ways to remove an element from
             * a contiguous block of memory.  I've chosen one that
             * doesn't do a memcpy/bcopy/array_delete, *shrug*...
             */
            for (j = i, k = i + 1; k < t->a.nelts; ++j, ++k) {
                elts[j].key = elts[k].key;
                elts[j].val = elts[k].val;
            }
            --t->a.nelts;
        }
        else {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}

Then on line 441 of "src/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c" you simply...

 ap_table_unset_val(resp_hdrs, "WWW-Authenticate","NTLM");
