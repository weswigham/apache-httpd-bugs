>Description:
I have 2 virtualhosts setup. I have a ScriptAlias in each pointing to the same
URL. In one vhost i have set the user and the group directives...

when I use the vhost with the directives i get internal server error, but if I
use the one without the directives it works fine.

I have a file struct in /var/www/<vhost.com> for all my vhosts I serve.  ex:

/var/www/innercite.com serves www.innercite.com   I want the cgi-bin under that 
dir to be the scriptalias and run under user "icite". which is what the User 
directive inthat vhost is set to. Now in my suexec.h i have the USERDIR_SUFFIX
set to /var/www should this be set like that? If not what should go there...

>How-To-Repeat:
http://solar.innercite.com/cgi-bin/wwwadmin.pl is the one WITHOUT the User directives
http://webtest.innercite.com/cgi-bin/wwwadmin.pl User is set to "icite"
the same exact file for both so its not a cgi program problem...

the file perms are all set u+rw and dirs have u+xrw, so its not perms...

State-Changed-Why:
This is a configuration question, not a bug report.

First, read your suexec log as defined by LOG_EXEC in
suexec.h.

Second, what the USERDIR_SUFFIX is is explained quite clearly
in the comment in the suexec.h file and in the documentation.

 I read the comment in suexec.h and it was very unclear on how to
 configure it with vhosts... I found it clear rto do normal user
 wrapping, but not when the cgi-bin was NOT in a users home dir...

 [19:36:06 15-05-98]: uid: (innercit/innercit) gid: (users/users)
 wwwboard.pl
 [19:36:06 15-05-98]: command not in docroot
 (/var/www/innercite.com/cgi-bin/wwwb
 oard.pl)
 
 there is the error. But what would the documentroot have anything to do
 with cgi's?
 
 Could you please help. I really like the Apache project, and someday
 wish to get involved and give back like as was the plan originally
 intended.
 
 Thanks..
