SunOS mur7 5.7 Generic_106542-03 i86pc i386 i86pc
>Description:
The apxs man page, located in src/support/apxs.8, has a typo in line 295.

Currently, it reads:
"This indicates the installation operartion and installs one or more"

The 5th word, "operartion", is propably "operation".
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at man page.
>Fix:
Delete the superflous character ;-)
