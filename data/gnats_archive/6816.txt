Linux 2.2.15-SMP (RedHat 6.2 release/built the kernel myself). Egcs 2.91.66. glibc-2.1.3. 
>Description:
On an almost completely idle server (5 hits yesterday?), every 8 hours or so (it's happened thrice now), one or more httpd process will go haywire and start consuming 100% of available CPU time:

  8:33am  up 54 days,  3:21,  2 users,  load average: 1.24, 1.10, 0.79
110 processes: 104 sleeping, 2 running, 1 zombie, 3 stopped
CPU states: 24.1% user, 32.1% system,  0.0% nice, 43.6% idle
Mem:   192828K av,  180124K used,   12704K free,   33968K shrd,  104784K buff
Swap:  265032K av,   28820K used,  236212K free                   18260K cached

  PID USER     TTY      PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
21328 nobody   ?         16   0  3044 3044 R    99.5  1.5  21:07 /web/apache2/bin/httpd

If I try to strace it, strace just returns as if the process has faulted. If I "kill 21328", nothing happens. If I "kill -9 21328", it goes away and is NOT replaced by another runaway process (at least for another 8 hours or so).

I also see large amounts of "TIME" (according to ps/top) on httpd processes where there was no web activity to account for the usage:

Notice those processes are in the "T" state?
