>Environment:
Win32 running Apache/1.3.4 (Win32)
>Description:
If you password protect a directory with .htaccess, and .htpasswd, and the password that you use in .htpasswd is encrypted using htpasswd for Windows, it will not work.  However, if it is NOT encrypted, it WILL work.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Just make it so that the Win32 version of Apache will recoginze encrypted passwords inside the .htpasswd file.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Mar  2 15:55:30 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This is documented.  Win32 doesn't support the functionality
required (ie. crypt()) so current versions of Apache don't
do that.

Future versions will implement their own algorithm which,
while not compatible with the traditional Unix crypt(),
will work just fine.
