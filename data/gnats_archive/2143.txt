>Environment:
WinNT 4.0 with SP3, Intel P166MMX, 64 megs.
>Description:
Similar to PR#1871 - as Apache runs the memory usage goes up.  Task Manager says about 41 megs in use at start, and about a day later it is up to 82 megs.  The difference between this and #1871 is that when I stop the Apache service, the memory is not all reclaimed.  If I reboot the machine, start another HTTPd, it is at the same meory usage that is was at startup a day later.  The box is a production machine getting a little under 10,000 hits a day.  I've noticed this in beta 3 and 6.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up an NT box, install the binaries for Apache 1.3b6, and try it out.
>Fix:
Nope - unfortunately I'm not a programmer

 Are you using any LoadModule directives to load any modules?
 
 Did you change the distributed config files in non-trivial ways?
 
 I can't reproduce this; using 41 megs at startup is not normla.

 I've kept the config files pretty much standard.  I've attached them if you
 want to look at them.  The 41 megs at startup is because RealServer is
 installed - I've tried the configuration without the RealServer and it does
 do the same thing but I'm not sure what the memory usage is at startup
 without RealServer.

 So you are saying that isn't the memory usage by the Apache process, but
 by the entire system.
 
 Does the Apache process itself grow?
 
 Does this cause problems?  Are you sure it isn't just normal memory being
 used by the OS?  Why do you think it is related to Apache?

 Subject: Re: os-windows/2143: Memory leakage
 
 The apache processes themselves do grow, but not that much.  The mail
 apache process seems to mainly grow in swap space and not in physical ram
 (When I reboot the main Apache process is usually at about 3.8 megs of
 physical memory and about 15 megs of virtual).
 
 I am 99.9% sure it is Apache because the memory leakage problem occurs when
 Apache is running, yet I have been running another HTTPd for about a week
 now with the same amount of traffic per day, and the memory usage has been
 steadily between 39 and 41 megs and has not gone above that.  I have both
 Apache and Omni set up so I can simply stop one service and start the
 other, and when I start up Apache and leave it sit for about 30 hours it is
 up to about 80 megs of usage.

State-Changed-Why:
Without more information it's difficult to go forward with
this.  Other people are not seeing this problem; not to say
it doesn't exist, but without someone saying "when this type
of request comes in, system memory usage goes up by 4k that
never goes away", it's simply impossible for us to figure
this out.  It wouldn't surprise us if there were serious 
memory leaks in the Posix compatibility interfaces we use,
given that those were probably implemented by a college
summer intern at Microsoft.  As we use more and more native
Win32 API's (such as we now use for CGI) this may become less
of an issue, but what would really help us is to know which
interfaces are leaky, so we can attack those first.

Thanks for the report, hope you can help us further.
