NetBSD 1.4 (host doesn't matter)
>Description:
I will be moving to a dynamic-IP configuration soon (DHCP lease based), which
necessitates using a service such as dynip.com to which I can point CNAMEs of
various domains.

Unfortunately, Apache insists on specifying static IP addresses to both the
NameVirtualHost and <VirtualHost> directives.  This won't work for me, as the
IP address of the web server may change--even while the system is running.

I'd like to be able to specify something similar to the following:

NameVirtualHost * [a]

<VirtualHost *> ... </VirtualHost> [b]

which would [a] identify all addresses as requiring name-based virtual host
lookup, and [b] allow a name-based virtual host to match on all addresses.

Even with "NameVirtualHost *", it would be possible to restrict particular
<VirtualHost> segments to a specific IP address.  What I'm looking for is a
"global-match" option for these directives.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to configure Apache to allow any IP address to carry any virtual host.
>Fix:
Add a hook to the IP parser for these directives that, say, maps "*" to "0.0.0.0",
and when matching virtual hosts, "0.0.0.0" matches any IP address.

I'll investigate this myself, but if someone with better Apache code knowledge
knows a quick way to implement this, please let me know!

 No.  There's two things I'm wanting here, to address two different problems:
 
 - A replicable wildcard for VirtualHost.
 
   This would allow a named virtual host to appear on *any* IP address, if
   desired using the HTTP/1.1 (and extended HTTP/1.0) Host: header.
   (Currently, an IP must be assigned to each VirtualHost, though you can
   duplicate the same ServerName in multiple VirtualHosts.)
 
   The <VirtualHost _default_> directive may be used exactly once, and does
   not do "NameVirtualHost matching" on the ServerName (since you may only
   have one of them).
 
 - A wildcard for NameVirtualHost, or "default" behavior of allowing
   NameVirtualHosts on all addresses.
 
   Name-based virtual hosts are only scanned on addresses for which the
   NameVirtualHost directive is given.  Frankly, I believe they should be
   allowed on all addresses by default (whenever a Host: header is supplied).
   However, a wildcard for NameVirtualHost would suffice.
 
 =====
 
 The two setups I administer which require something like the above:
 
 - One server with a dynamically changing IP address to the outside world
   which has multiple named virtual hosts.  (Providing an IP address to
   either VirtualHost or NameVirtualHost would be meaningless.)
 
 - A cluster of servers, referenced by multiple DNS address records for each
   domain served.  These machines do failover -- if one crashes, another
   picks up the orphaned IP address as an alias, just to keep that address
   from becoming a "black hole" in the DNS address list.  (The cluster
   machines need a way to allow dynamically added IP addresses to serve the
   same name based virtual hosts without modifying httpd.conf.)
 
 The <VirtualHost _default_> directive provides settings to be a "catch-all"
 if a virtual host is not matched, which doesn't help either situation above.
 
 In these networks, I do in fact have a <VirtualHost _default_> directive
 that points to a page reading "Update your browser ... to one supporting
 HTTP/1.1 named virtual hosts ...."

State-Changed-Why:

The current architecture of Apache permits name-based vhosts
on one and only one IP address.  Changing that is a major
understaking, so I am suspending this report for future
consideration.
