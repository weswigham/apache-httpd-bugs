State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Wed Jan 24 10:23:50 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Apache has no "upload" support out of the box.
Since this is a basic configuration question, and not
a bug report, I suggest you try asking on
comp.infosystems.servers.www.ms-windows (accessible
via http://deja.com/).

Thanks for using Apache!

Sorry, the newsgroup name is
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
I had it wrong before.
