This is a RedHat 6.1 box with a custom build of apache.
512 MB RAM on a dual Pentium III

Apache is built as:    Server Version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) mod_perl/1.21 PHP/3.0.12
               and     Server Version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 mod_ssl/2.4.6 OpenSSL/0.9.4
>Description:
We have a failry large web server with 9 separate instances and versions of apache
running.  We have named them the following: httpd-d1, httpd-d2, httpd-d3, httpd-d4,
httpd-d5, httpd-h1, httpd-ssl, httpd-fp, and httpd-sava.

About once a day, now, we notice that the machine's load rises to about 1 and stays
there.  At this time, we try to restart the the web servers (using kill -HUP `cat /home/logs/<servername>.pid`)
and all but (usually) one server restarts.  A typical amount of traffic for one of
these servers is about 125000 connections and 1GB per day.  There are rarely any
messages in the error log for that server.  Sometimes we will see something like this, but
not always:

[Thu Nov 18 08:48:40 1999] [warn] child process 24339 still did not exit, sending a SIGTERM
[Thu Nov 18 08:48:44 1999] [error] child process 24339 still did not exit, sending a SIGKILL
[Thu Nov 18 08:49:00 1999] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down

strace -p <pid> on the parent process returns nothing for the dead server.  The web
server still serves up pages through the children, but as the children die, or are killed,
they are not respawning.  So, I guess it looks like the parent is dead.  The only way 
to get that instance of apache running again is to restart the machine.

If we neglect to watch the load, then eventually the whole linux box locks up.  The
load gradually gets higher and higher after several hours of the parent being
unresponsive.

The following is a typical httpd.conf file with some cuts made in the VirtualHost section:

>How-To-Repeat:
The problem seems to be the cause.  It typically happens every 24 hours or so.
If we increase the MaxRequestsPerChild then it will last longer, if we decrease
it then the server dies sooner.  Would happen once a week when it was set to 0...
once every 10 hours when it was 10000
>Fix:
For now we restart the servers regularly and monitor the load.  We really need a
fix, though.

State-Changed-Why:
Try running an older, more stable kernel.  We have had lots
of reports of similar things from people, with the common
factor being that thay are using 2.2.13 or something similar.

There may well be some problem in the kernel you are running
that causes this.

If you have to restart the machine (and I presume you mean
reboot) to fix it, then there is no way that this can be
entirely an Apache problem.

 Are you using NFS?
 
 So are you saying you can't kill the children, even with a kill -9?

 Interesting.  You may want to try going back further.

 Many.
 
 I have seen a half dozen reports over the past two months of behaviour
 similar to yours.  While there have been cases in the past when such
 things have been tracked down to problems in Apache, they have been
 rare.  This sudden splurge of bug reports has also only started very
 recently, and they all have the common denominator of running a recent
 2.2.x kernel.
 
 I don't know how flexible you are or what other factors you have to take
 into consideration, but I would strongly suggest trying moving to a
 different kernel.  What different kernel?  Good question.  Maybe an early
 2.2 one, maybe a 2.1 one, maybe all the way back to the current 2.0 one.  
 Unfortunately I can't really make much in the way of recommendations
 there.
 
 You could, just for something to do, try disabling SMP.

 Yes, but we are only serving NFS, there are no NFS mounts on this server

 Correct, kill -9 does nothing to the children.  They just hang there until
 a reboot.

 Ouch...I'd hope that we would have to go back to a pre 2.2 kernel.

 If it does seem to be a problem in the kernel, do you have any ideas as
 who to contact next?  We'll give the SMP thing a try.  Maybe it'll work.
 I'll let you know.
