LynxOS hazel 3.0.1 110298-G i386

>Description:
The build under lynx fails as one of the operating system include files is
conf.h. The conf.h supplied with Apache is included instead of this
file from another OS header file breaking the build.

The conf.h included is only a dummy header file anyway so I just
renamed it and everything built succesfully. 

Why include conf.h at all?

>How-To-Repeat:
If you have Lynx OS you shopuld be able to duplicate this.
>Fix:
remove conf.h
