>Environment:
OS: Win95, OEM verB (4.00.95.B)
Pre-compiled ver 1.3b3 Apache for Win95
>Description:
# From httpd.conf, this DOES work:

DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html
<Directory /home/httpd/html>
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride None
  order allow,deny
  allow from all
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName users
  AuthUserFile  /etc/httpd/wwwusers
  require valid-user
</Directory>

# This DOES NOT work:

ScriptAlias /user/ /home/httpd/cgi-alt/
<Directory /home/httpd/cgi-alt/>
  AllowOverride None
  Options None
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName users
  AuthUserFile  /etc/httpd/wwwusers
  require valid-user
</Directory>

# Note: wwwusers must have plaintext passswords, no crypt() in Win95.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unknown.. I only have one Win95 machine running this Apache server.
Basic Auth in Script Aliased Directories works OK on my linux(2.0.30)
machine with Apache 1.2.4 server.
I posted problem to comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
and to comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows last week
with no response to either.
>Fix:
Sorry... I don't have a copy of MS Visual C++ v5.0 or I would try to fix
