>Description:
mod_usertrack adds its cookie in a fixup handler.  If another module has
already added a cookie header via ap_table_add(r->headers_out,...), it will
be smushed because mod_usertrack uses ap_table_setn which treats the tables
as a 1-1 mapping from name to value, overwriting and/or deleting away any 
pre-existing Set-Cookie headers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Have to write a pre-fixup or a fixup handler that precedes mod_usertrack.
>Fix:
The fix I have been using (against Apache 1.3.12) is:

--- mod_usertrack.c.orig        Thu Mar  9 01:10:16 2000
+++ mod_usertrack.c     Thu Mar  9 01:10:49 2000

                                 dcfg->cookie_name, cookiebuf);
     }

-    ap_table_setn(r->headers_out, "Set-Cookie", new_cookie);
+    ap_table_add(r->headers_out, "Set-Cookie", new_cookie);
     ap_table_setn(r->notes, "cookie", ap_pstrdup(r->pool, cookiebuf));   /*
log first time */
     return;
 }
