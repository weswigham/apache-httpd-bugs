>Organization:
>Environment:
Apache 1.3.19, probably earlier as well.  Linux 2.4.2, gcc 2.95.2
>Description:
Fairly simple, mail/util.c:2048 returns a NULL pointer if gethostbyname(str) fails to lookup str.  The next use of *p is an indirection, p->h_addr_list.  Thus dereferencing a NULL pointer.

Since nearly all systems have their hostname defined, pretty much nobody experiences this.  With my quick patch applied, httpd falls through to the next part which emits the following:

penguin:/usr/local/apache# bin/httpd -t                                       
[Thu Mar 15 18:27:07 2001] [alert] httpd: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName

It isn't a serious bug as again, normally localhost/127.0.0.1 is defined.
>How-To-Repeat:
simply arrange your system so the configuration's fqdn doesn't resolve for ap_get_local_host().
