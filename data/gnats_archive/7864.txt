>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
RedHat Linux 6.2, kernel 2.2.19
>Description:
We use an apache server in front of some other web servers, mostly for logging
in a uniform way. We use proxypass te pass on requests to the other web servers.
This assumes however that the other server has a different name than the apache
server:
<VirtualHost ..>
    ServerName front.server.dom
    ProxyPass / http://back.server.dom/
</VirtualHost>

For some purposes it would be convenient to do:

<VirtualHost ...>
    ServerName front.server.dom
    ProxyPass / http://front.server.dom/ back.server.dom
</VirtualHost>

This would allow the back.server.dom machine to have front.server.dom as a 
virtual host as well.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Please, add the suggested optional host parameter.
