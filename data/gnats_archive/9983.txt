Linux demokrit 2.4.16-4GB #1 Wed Dec 19 09:08:41 GMT 2001 i686 unknown

SuSE 7.3 with updates up to last week

gcc-2.95.3, glibc-2.2.4-64

OCaml-3.04
>Description:
The output of a CGI program called nph-cgi is prefixed
with full set of headers, in particular with Content-Length.
For the calculation of the latter, apache has to wait for all
parts of the server-push x-multipart-replace to have been produced.

Therefore, the server push effect is destroyed,
and the ``script'' response is display as text/plain,
including the ``script''-produced headers.

The same ``script'' works properly in apache-1.3.23
>How-To-Repeat:
Probably any server-push script does it.

http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~kahl/apache/

has Linux i386 binary, OCaml (http://caml.inria.fr/) source
and tar.gz containing both (an my ./configure call):

-rwxr-xr-x         266665 Feb 27 17:24 nph-push*
-rw-r--r--          2691 Feb 27 17:23 push.ml
-rw-r--r--         102715 Feb 27 17:28 push.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--            324 Feb 21 12:10 config1
>Fix:
I verified that mod_cgid is taking the ``if(nph)'' branch,
so somewhere downstream from that something ignores
the fact that the script output comes with headers.
