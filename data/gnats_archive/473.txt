>Environment:
Operating system : Solaris 2.4
Compiler : gcc
Station : Sun Sparc 5
Browser : Harvest Gatherer from Harvest vers 1.4.pl2
>Description:
I use Harvest system to index my apache server, this system has a gatherer which
only support HTTP 1.0. It send HTTP 1.0 request to my apache server and my server
send HTTP 1.1 response. So the gathere stops because of this problem. I 've look
in the bugs database, and found such problem (bug signaled 21 dec 1996 about
apache 1.2b1), you said that it has been corrected, but it seems not. 
I thought that apache was HTTP 1.0 compliant, it isn't the case ?
So, good luck !
>How-To-Repeat:
You must install harvest system and try to gather a server which work with
apache 1.2b8.

State-Changed-Why:
A HTTP/1.1 response to a HTTP/1.0 request is perfectly 
legitimate.  The client is broken if it does not understand
it and should be fixed.  The decision to send a HTTP/1.1
response to HTTP/1.0 requests is concious and desirable.

You can use something like:

	BrowserMatch "xxx" force-response-1.0

where xxx is the User-Agent that the broken client sends.
You should get the client fixed.
