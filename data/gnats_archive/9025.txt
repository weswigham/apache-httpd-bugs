I get the following error, (event viewer doesn't say anything). 
Can't locate Cwd.pm in @INC (@INC contains: .) at (eval 1) line 1.
  I haven't installed any external modules. I went through your previous error reports, i couldn't figure out.
  Please give your suggestions

State-Changed-When: Mon Dec 10 09:34:25 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This is an issue for Oracle whom you aquired the Apache
software from.  Mod perl can't find it's required paths,
and mod_perl doesn't come configured by default for
Apache... this is an Oracle configuration.
