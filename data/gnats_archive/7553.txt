State-Changed-Why:
Can you please include the complete output from configure?  I am
able to successfully configure apache 2.0 on Solaris 8 + gcc.
Hopefully a comparison of your configure output and mine will
point to an earlier problem.  Also, include the contents of 
config.log.  This too has debugging information.

Thanks!
