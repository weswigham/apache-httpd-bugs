>Environment:
I am using Windows 2000 SP2. I did not compile Apache but used the compiled version from your website. 
>Description:
Most html files in manual directory have an extension of .html.html. So this results in broken links when going from one html page to another in the manuals. But it works fine if you take out one .html extension. 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
take out one .html extension.

State-Changed-Why:

Those .html.html extensions are necessary to properly
implement language negotiation.  Unfortunately, this
means that you will need to browse the docs through
the server (http://localhost/manual/) with 
Options Multiviews turned on.

Thanks for using Apache.
