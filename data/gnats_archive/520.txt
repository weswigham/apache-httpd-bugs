HPUX 10.20 with barebones, vendor supplied ANSI-C compiler - Compiler was 
sufficient, however, to compile Perl 5.003 successfully so I so have confidence
in it.
>Description:
I think I have found a bug in the most recent compile script.
I can't compile Apache 1.2b10 on my HP-UX 10.20.

During my "make" At line 544 of conf.h ...

int ap_snprintf(char *buf, size_t len, const char *format,...);
int ap_vsnprintf(char *buf, size_t len, const char *format, va_list ap);

... I get the following errors:

(Bundled) cc: "conf.h", line 544: error 1000: Unexpected symbol: "size_t".
(Bundled) cc: "conf.h", line 544: warning 5: "const" will become a keyword.

(Bundled) cc: "alloc.h", line 77: error 1000: Unexpected symbol: "*".
(Bundled) cc: error 2017: Cannot recover from earlier errors, terminating.
*** Error exit code 1

Here is a larger excerpt of conf.h surrounding the failing lines.

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
/*
 * We use snprintf() to avoid overflows, but we include
 * our own version (ap_snprintf). Allow for people to use their
 * snprintf() if they want
 */
#ifdef HAVE_SNPRINTF
#define ap_snprintf     snprintf
#define ap_vsnprintf    vsnprintf
#else
int ap_snprintf(char *buf, size_t len, const char *format,...);
int ap_vsnprintf(char *buf, size_t len, const char *format, va_list ap);
#endif


I am running everything in Configuration by the defaults except that my ANSI-C compiler
does not support optimization (wierd but cheap).

I don't program in C but I have reviewed the PORTING guide and still can't figure
out whether this is a legitimate bug in the INSTALL procs.

Also from conf.h, here are the HP defaults.

#elif defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10)
#define HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H
#undef HAVE_GMTOFF
#define NO_KILLPG
#undef NO_SETSID
#ifndef _HPUX_SOURCE
#define _HPUX_SOURCE
#endif
#define JMP_BUF sigjmp_buf
#define HAVE_SHMGET
#ifndef HPUX10
#define SELECT_NEEDS_CAST
typedef int rlim_t;
#endif

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
>How-To-Repeat:
Full description is pretty complete. email me at etilley@pentathalon.com if you 
want to try a quick fix and I will let you know how it ran on this platform.
>Fix:
Minor C src alterations required I think. If I knew C better, I might have been
able to hack out a solution but I can't easily follow the assumptions the 
programmer made

 From: drz@apache.att.com
 
 I have played around with this release and try to make it build on
 HP-UX. I had the same problem with what you submitted initially.
 However, what I found out is there is something wroug with the script
 that can't generate the right set of CFLAGS. To be brief, here is what
 you can do:
 
 Modify the Makefile after you run the Configure and set CFLAGS as:
 
 CFLAGS1= -Aa -w -DHPUX -D_HPUX_SOURCE
 
 or
 
 CFLAGS1= -Aa -v -w -DHPUX10 -D_HPUX_SOURCE
 
 If you use HP/UX 10. It should make it build.

 [Another addition from improperly sent mail]
 
 BTW: No -O2 flag, but you can set +O2 if you like.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed May  7 08:26:41 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
User reports they are using HPUX's free compiler (which is
_NOT_ ANSI).  Although Larry may be able to avoid
using ANSI features Apache does and isn't going to 
change.  The best solution is gcc.
