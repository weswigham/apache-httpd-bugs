>Description:
When running a CGI script using Server side include the script runs more then once when a page is loaded. I'm using the (<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/john/counter.cgi"-->)  to call the script from within a html page. If I call the script directly from my browser it works fine. I'm using internet explorer 5, have not tried this with netscape.

State-Changed-When: Sun Oct  1 12:19:34 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Looks like the browser is doing a HEAD then GET, and that
mod_include is running the scripts for a HEAD request as
well as the GET.
