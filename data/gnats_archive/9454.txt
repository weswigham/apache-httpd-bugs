4 x 400Mhz processor with 2GB of memory and 2GB swap.
>Description:
We are terminating SSL at the web server. We've patched the apache web server with the apache-ssl code (www.apache-ssl.org) when we set the KeepAlive timeout to 10 and we get quite a few "Page Not Displayed" errors. We keep getting these errors, although less frequent, all the way up to 60. Currently we have it set at 75.
  We've modified the tcp parameters a bit:

/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_keepalive_interval 900000
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_min 6000
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_initial 6000
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_max 10000
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_close_wait_interval 60000
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_ip_abort_interval 60000
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max_q 1024

The web servers are behind F5's Big IP product.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately it's a large production system. We are currently trying to duplicate the problem in a test environment.
