>Environment:
Linux redhat 6.0 (glibc2.1)
>Description:
When compiling apache on glibc2.1 systems (linux redhat 6.0) - ndbm is
replaced by equivalent functionality in libdb1, with different include
file path.  The standard compilation fails to find <ndbm.h>

I checked - and the install of glibc2.1 deletes /usr/include/ndbm.h
>How-To-Repeat:
compile mod_rewrite or mod_auth_dbm
>Fix:
patch src/helpers/find-dbm-lib so it uses -ldb1 instead of -lndbm
and configure with CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/db1".  I cant vouch for
the validity of this, but looking at redhat's build of "python" this
is how they worked around the problem.
