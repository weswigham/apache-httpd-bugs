Win95, version 4.00.950.B
>Description:
After installing the binaries via apache_1_3_9_win32.exe, Apache failed to start.
Message received: WS32_32.DLL not found.  The purpose of this DLL is not clear.
A search of my hard drives failed to locate a copy.  I assume it is specific to
Apache 1.3.9 and was left out of the binary distribution.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache 1.3.9 over Apache 1.3.6.
>Fix:
Nope!
