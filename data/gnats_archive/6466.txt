>Description:
When I spider a web site which has more than 1 million pages, only few pages changed in the most time, but I have to spider almost all the pages.

If Web Server can return only the new pages urls which newer than a certain date, the spider will do very fast.

Can Apache add this function in 2.0 version?

State-Changed-When: Tue Sep 19 17:03:50 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
If your spider uses If-Modified-Since requests,
it may only retrieve changed documents.  Other than
that, there is no explicit way using HTTP to
inform a spider of a set of changed web pages.
Thanks for using Apache.
