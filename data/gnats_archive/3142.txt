Fully patched red hat linux 5.0 on pentium, 1.3.2 source built with gcc,
inexperienced administrator.
>Description:
apachectl configtest reported config OK, but would not start. A look at the
error-log showed, a directory referred to in a logging directive did not exist.

Due to inexperience there was a delay in locating the log file which contained
the relevant messages containing the key to the exact misconfiguration.

grep -i log httpd.conf | less 
provided the correct file, but several minutes passed during which many name-based
virtual hosts were not accessible.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add an ErrorLog directive to a <VirtualHost> section specifying to a file
in a nonexistent directory.
>Fix:
Feature-requests:

1:  display path to active error-log file when httpd will not start

2:  extend apachectl configtest to test directories for existence
    and sane permissions, like innd's "inncheck", even going so far as
    to generate a shell script to correct simple directory existence and
    permissions problems.
