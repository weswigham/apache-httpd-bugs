>Description:
In B3, several error messages are now at different log levels.  For example,
the "server busy" message, is now classified as "INFO" in the http_main.c 
error logger. I was attempting to find these messages as they were in B2, but
was surprised (and pleased) to find a configuration directive.  

Attempting to find this directive description on the WEB site was not very
successful.  But looking at the code uncovered this gem.

Please correct.

Thanks!

Mike
