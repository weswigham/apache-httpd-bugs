Even though closeness in cyber and actual space are not the same thing,
it would be much easier to choose the closest mirror from the homepage
if it gave some indication where those pages were...

Ob thanks for the great product of course.

State-Changed-Why:
At /this/ point country seems to be sufficient granularity, 
but we're considering an extra field in the mirrors database 
for extra description.  It seems dangerous to go much further,
though.  One of the US mirrors only sits one block away
from apache.org.  :)
