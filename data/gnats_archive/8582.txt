>Description:
QUERY_STRING is empty in a PHP document when MultiViews is used.

When the extension is left off the problem manifests. When the extension is included in the URL there are no problems.

Further details are in PHP's bug database:

 I'm getting hit by this too. Spent 36 hours pulling my hair out before
 someone pointed me at the apache bug page. Please fix urgently, I don't
 what to see my host upgrade to .22 and have my site fall over :(

 --Apache 1.3.22 MultiViews--
 
 Calling a php page without the document extension clears all URI argument
 variables.
 
 I resolved the problem patching the file:
 
     src/modules/standard/mod_negotiation.c
 
 Lines 2713-2714 in the handle_multi routine are buggy:
     r->uri = sub_req->uri;
     r->args = sub_req->args;
 
 replace them with:
     r->unparsed_uri = sub_req->unparsed_uri;
 
 Tested with php 4.0.6 static module in apache 1.3.22 on a
 linux slackware 8.

State-Changed-Why:

The lines you noted were reverted to the (.20) behavior and
are fixed in CVS and the next (.23) release.  Thanks for
your report!

Do you see an ongoing value in unparsed_uri being 
propagated to the main request?  Again, it's a possibly
misleading dis-syncronization, reverting the patch
brought us back to treating this as a 'file redirection'.
