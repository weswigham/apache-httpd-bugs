>Description:
 srm.conf-dist contains the entry

    IndexIgnore */.??* *~ *# */HEADER* */README* */RCS

  But what's the reason for the "*/" syntax, eg. "*/README"
  instead of just "README"?
  At least for me the following entry produces the same result
  like the entry from srm.conf-dist:

    IndexIgnore .??* *~ *# HEADER* README* RCS

  Maybe this is a bug, because the documentation of IndexIgnore
  talks about 'partial filenames' and 'file extensions' which
  seems not to work, eg. ".txt" does not hide "foobar.txt", but
  only ".txt".


  P.S.: IMHO "core" should always be hidden. Maybe it's a good idea to
        add this to the IndexIgnore entry in your srm.conf-dist file.

 Starting with 1.2b9 the following protects cores better than using
 IndexIgnore:
 
 <Files ~ "/core$">
     order deny,allow
     deny from all
 </Files>
 
 (Although that specific case might work in b8, but a bug fix went in for
 it in b9.)
 
 I'll let someone else deal with the doc issue.

State-Changed-Why:
A brief examination of the code does seem to indicate that
the leading "*/" may be superfluous.  The .conf-dist and/or
documentation may not be corrected until a release after
1.2, but this will definitely be looked at more closely.

State-Changed-Why:
srm.conf-dist in 1.3 won't contain the paths.  Even though it's
silly for mod_dir to accept them, it just ignores the path if present.
But that's just one more notch on the "mod_dir silliness list".
