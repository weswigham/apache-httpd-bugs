>Description:
Apache httpd always detaches itself to become a background process. The only way 
around this seems to be the -X option, which is not really any useful in
production use. Running apache from inetd or the like is not desirable for
performance reasons.

This makes it impossible to run Apache from init, or any serious process
supervising tools (like http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html)

The actual process the shell spawned is gone.
>Fix:
Introduce an option to make apache not background. (options to do access or
errorlogging on stdout would be appreciated too, btw).

State-Changed-When: Sun Apr 29 21:03:24 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

This feature is available in Apache 2.0 (command line
option -D NO_DETACH).  Major new features are not
being added to Apache 1.3 at this point.

Thanks for using Apache!
