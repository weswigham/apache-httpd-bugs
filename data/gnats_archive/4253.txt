Windows NT, Servicepack 4
>Description:
When I want to uninstall Apache, it doesn't clean the Registry, all Keys etc. stay. So when I install a new Apache to another place, it doesn't start as Service. I have to clean these Keys on my own with regedit. Will there be/is there a patch/newer version?
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install it as a Service and deinstall it.
>Fix:
Enhance the Installshield.

State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 12:12:58 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/

Further, Windows itself is irresponsible in not cleaning up
the appropriate ENUM entries, not much we can help you with
there.  That bug's for them.
