IRIX 5.3
uname -a = IRIX summit 5.3 11091811 IP19 mips  (SGI Onyx/RE2)

>Description:
apache 1.3b7 compiled fine using both gcc 2.7.2 and cc. But when using
"sbin/apachectl start" to launch httpd it couldn't do it. It complained

fopen: No such file or directory
httpd: could not open document config file /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
apachectl start: httpd could not be started

$prefix in this case is /home/murre/www. 

The same problem does not show up on SGI O2s running IRIX 6.3.

How did you compile Apache?  Does this still happen with
