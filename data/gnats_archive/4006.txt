>Description:
JServ needs to have write access to $HTTPD/var/apache/log/jserv.log
because when the file is created initialy, Apache is running as
root, but then it changes to "nobody", and as such it does
not have permission to writ to jserv.log. 
The solution is to manually chmod 0666 jserv.log after it is
created, and then restart apache. 
It would be much better for apache to chmod this automatically,
or to chown the file after it is created to nobody.
