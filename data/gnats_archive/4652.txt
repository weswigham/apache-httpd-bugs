>Description:
I'm trying to use an object that implements HttpSessionBindingListener 
to do some clean up work when a session is invalidated.  I'm running
into the problem that, when my valueUnbound() method is called, the
Session object passed in has already been invalidated - so it's
impossible to do any work on it - in my case calling getId(). 

Moving the valid=false in JservSession.invalidate() to be set
AFTER the while loop that calls and HttpSessionBindingEvents()
solves the problem.

Is this a bug or part of the spec?  Does this create other problems?  
Am I not supposed to be able to access the session that's passed
to the valueUnbound() event?  (Doesn't seem to make much sense!)
