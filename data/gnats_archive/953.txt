External server, runs with multiple virtual ip#s, specifically 3 ip#s bound to
the one interface.
>Description:
I'm currently using apache 1.1.3, and decided to migrate to 1.2.1 across our
3 main servers. we have this configured so that 2 internal servers, run with
one being Main and the other a Virtualhost, and 3 external servers run
with one being Main and the other 2 defined in Virtualhost.

Under 1.1.3, this works perfectly. e.g

http://www.dstc.edu.au goes to /www/public/htdocs
http://webpages.dstc.edu.au goes to /www/webpages/htdocs
http://metadata.net goes to /www/metadata/htdocs

Under 1.2.1, this breaks completely for me, and all requests go to the first
Virtualhost only, e.g

http://www.dstc.edu.au goes to /www/webpages/htdocs
http://webpages.dstc.edu.au goes to /www/webpages/htdocs
http://metadata.net goes to /www/webpages.htdocs

if i kill the 1.2.1 server and go back to 1.1.3, then it works fine again.

the conf files are unchanged between the two versions, so i'm at a loss to
understand why the server appears to ignore the Main server directive.

i've had a look through the problem database, and can summarise with

"Virtualhosts are broken in 1.2, either dont use them, or dont try and
use the main server, instead putting everything into Virtualhosts".

Before i am forced to do this, is there any possibility this is a
reproducible bug and might be fixed (or if you know of what i might
be doing to cause this..)

An example of one of my virtualhost directives is

#
<VirtualHost webpages.dstc.edu.au>
ServerAdmin     brads@dstc.edu.au
DocumentRoot    /www/webpages/htdocs/
ServerName      webpages.dstc.edu.au
ErrorLog        /var/www/webpages/logs/error_log
TransferLog     /var/www/webpages/logs/access_log
ResourceConfig  /www/public/conf/webpages_srm.conf
</VirtualHost>
#


>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.dstc.edu.au (currently on 1.1.3).
http://webpages.dstc.edu.au (virtual)
http://metadata.net         (virtual)

if you email me, i'll be able to put up the 1.2.1 server and you can observe the
behaviour of the above urls.
>Fix:
work out what changed in virtual host handling between 1.1.3 and 1.2.1 ? :-)

since i'm using a very similar Configuration file, and the conf files are
identical, its hard for me to see why virtual hosts are broken for me

 Virtualhosts are also broken in 1.1.3, you just happen to not be tickling
 the problems.
 
 Are all your hosts ip based, and one of them has the same address as the
 main server? 
 
 You can force Apache to disable all the name-based vhost stuff (which
 sounds like what you want) by putting "ServerName localhost" outside of
 all the vhosts.  That effectively disables the main server too.
 
 Otherwise, I need to know what your DNS resolves to for each of the
 virtualhosts, and for any ServerName directive in the "main server".  If
 you don't have a ServerName directive, then apache will do a
 gethostname(), so I need to know what your hostname resolves to.

 i'm running apache on 2 different machines.
 
 the internal machine has a `physical' ip# of 130.102.176.27, and 
 an `alias' of 130.102.176.26.
 (one normal and one virtualhost)
 
 the external machine has a physical ip# of 130.102.181.9 and aliases
 of 130.102.181.11 and 130.102.181.12
 (one normal and two virtualhosts)

 nod.  i'm going to have to do that, if theres no easy fix for this.  yep,
 i've tickled the virtualhost bugs in 1.1.3 before, but somehow managed to
 work around them, to the point it `worked'.

 here are my forward lookups for the `external' machine.
 
 ;
 shelob          IN      A       130.102.181.9
                 IN      MX      10      piglet.dstc.edu.au.
 www             IN      CNAME   shelob
 ftp             IN      CNAME   shelob
 external        IN      CNAME   shelob
 ;
 webpages        IN      A       130.102.181.11

 and reverse lookups are:
