>Description:
After configuring Jserv and running make, I get the following message:

"jserv_mmap.c", line 359.33: 1506-068 (S) Operation between types "void" and
 "void" is not allowed.

I don't know if this is a problem with the Jserv config or with xlc.

I did not that the compiler is being invoked via cc.  I don't know if it 
would help to use xlc instead, but I couldn't figure out how to force that
change.

Any help would be appreciated.
