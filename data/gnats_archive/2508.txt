>Description:
Hi,

this is not a bug report, but I did not find a suitable place to post this to.
I have written an Apache+SSL+PHP/FI+frontpage-mini-howto that describes how
to build a multipurpose webserver.
You can find it at www.faure.de. I would be grateful if you place a link to
this site in the document section of www.apache.org

TIA

The URL you provided does not have any information, and
a search of the LDP site to which it points doesn't show
anything dealing with PHP.  Please let us know when you
have a URL ready for this.. Thanks!
