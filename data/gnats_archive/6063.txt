Problem was getting "Error 1067 : Service terminated unexpectedly"-message when trying to start the Apache server.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Variable "ServerName" in httpd.conf isn't set. Uncomment the special line in httpd.conf and give a servername.

ServerName localhost     instead of
#ServerName your.name.com
