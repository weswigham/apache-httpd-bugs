regarding binaries in apache_1.2.4-sun4m-sun-solaris2.tar.Z
>Description:
I downloaded apache_1.2.4-sun4m-sun-solaris2.tar.Z from apache.org but the support directory 
did not contain the executables. I have NO access to a C compiler and don't know anyone 
(trusted source) who does. I'm stuck until I get an executable copy of htpasswd.

Is there some reason that you can't download and install

State-Changed-Why:
1.2.4 is out of date... who knows how we did for the binaries in
1.2.5 ... binaries suck.  (Or we suck at generating them.)
