Using pre-compiled Apache binaries.
>Description:
Apache in every other respect is working great!
But when I run a CGI script under the ActiveState Perl debugger (via '#!perl -d' at top of cgi script), longer scripts (>100 lines) take a long time to load into the debugger. In the meantime, there is a crazy flickering of the mouse pointer.
The longer the cgi script, the longer it takes for the flickering to settle down and the debugger to become usable.

This problem does not manifest when using the Xitami server (though I don't want to switch back to Xitami because it is so limited in other ways).

>How-To-Repeat:
Install ActivePerl for Win32.
Install ActivePerl software development kit (includes Perl Debugger).
Edit the '#!' line at the top one of your test cgi scripts (choose a longer script with 300-1000 lines), and put '-d' after 'perl', so invoking the script will launch it under the perl debugger
Open a browser, and invoke the cgi script.
Notice the flickering of the mouse cursor, and observe that the debugger stays inaccessible for anything from several seconds to several minutes.

No, sorry
