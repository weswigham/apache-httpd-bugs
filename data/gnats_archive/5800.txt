>Description:
On 11/30/1999, Jim Garrison asked on comp.infosystems.www 
why does path_info exhibit such inconsistent behavior 
in the presence of an action directive.
He set .pdq to be handled by printenv.cgi and go the following behavior:
>  http://host.domain.com/zzz/printenv.cgi/additional
> invokes the script with PATH_INFO set as
>     PATH_INFO = /additional
> whereas the URL
>     http://host.domain.com/pdq/test.pdq/additional
> invokes the script with PATH_INFO set as
>     PATH_INFO = /pdq/test.pdq/additional
> which seems to be a bug.  I was expecting the same
> PATH_INFO in both cases.

Even wierder is that, if test.pdq doesn't exist, 
apache issues a 404 rather than executing your handler.

The only answer I saw was David Efflandt's:
> When a CGI is invoked as an Action handler, it gets the full URL path to

However, under test.pdq, PATH_TRANSLATED is test.pdq/additional, a file
that does not exist!

Since apache won't execute the handler unless test.pdq exists, the
path translated must really be /path/to/pdq/test.pdq (PATH_TRANSLATED
notwithstanding).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Under test.pdq, Apache should do:
SCRIPT_NAME = /pdq/test.pdq
PATH_INFO = /additional
PATH_TRANSLATED = /path/to/pdq/test.pdq
