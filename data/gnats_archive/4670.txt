 It turns out that IBM considers this to be a bona-fide problem. Their
 problem database recommends a workaround but they have nevertheless issued
 an APAR for the problem, numbered IY00966. I've installed it and it does
 indeed permit a successful build. Depending on your IBM compiler release,
 this bug may also prevent perl 5.005_03 build.
