After I created the directory /home/root and placed a copy of the libtool file from the apache directory out there, it worked like a champ.
>How-To-Repeat:
Problem should be reproducable on any UX system that doesn't have a copy of libtool in /home/root.  Unsure of the behavior if libtool can be found in the path.
>Fix:
Since you seem to include or build a copy of libtool with the distribution, include a direct reference to it in the build directory.
The workaround is easy enough for someone who can trace down the problem, and probably wouldn't be seen on any machines that have gcc 'well configured' with all the the correct tools in the path.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Sun Apr  8 20:59:12 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This was fixed just after the beta was released.  The fix
was to use the $(LIBTOOL) variable instead of a direct 
reference to libtool
