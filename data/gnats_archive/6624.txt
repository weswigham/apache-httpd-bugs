>Description:
"Apart from <Directory>, each group is processed in the order that they appear in the configuration files. <Directory> (group 1 above) is processed in the order shortest directory component to longest. If multiple <Directory> sections apply to the same directory they they are processed in the configuration file order. The configuration files are read in the order httpd.conf, srm.conf and access.conf. Configurations included via the Include directive will be treated as if they where inside the including file at the location of the Include directive."
	This begs the question: if multiple <Location> sections apply to the same directory, are they read and applied in order of appearance? Specifically, I'm wondering if adding <Location> Options -Indexes </Location> will screw anything up.
