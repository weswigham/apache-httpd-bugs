Subject: (Win32) mod_jserv is not sending the SHUTDOWN message to the JServ Java process

>Release:        1.3.14
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4 Server, SP5, JServ 1.1.2
>Description:
The most obvious consequence is that when Apache is shutdown, none of the servlets running under JServ have their destroy() method called.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a simple servlet that performs some observable action in
its destroy method (creates a file, for example).  Install it in JServ,
and add it to the servlets.startup list in the default zone.  Start
Apache, wait until all the servlets have started, then shutdown apache.
Note that the action performed by the destroy method hasn't been performed,
because destroy hasn't been called!
>Fix:
I've gleaned some information that might help in coming up with a fix.

In jserv.conf I've got:

ApJServLogLevel info

and in jserv.properties

log.channel.info=true
log.channel.servletException=true
log.channel.jservException=true
log.channel.warning=true
log.channel.servletLog=true
log.channel.critical=true
log.channel.debug=true

When I shutdown Apache, the following messages appear in mod_jserv.log:

[30/01/2001 21:40:33:276] (INFO) wrapper: controller started (PID=363)
[31/01/2001 04:00:34:092] (INFO) wrapper: Shutdown done (PID=394)
[31/01/2001 04:00:34:112] (INFO) Apache Module was cleaned-up
[31/01/2001 04:00:39:490] (INFO) wrapper: thread did not end, terminating it
[31/01/2001 04:00:39:490] (INFO) wrapper: controller thread stopped
[31/01/2001 04:00:39:490] (INFO) wrapper: Java Virtual Machine still alive after controller kill
[31/01/2001 04:00:39:490] (INFO) wrapper: Java Virtual Machine stopped
[31/01/2001 04:00:39:490] (INFO) wrapper: Shutdown done (PID=363)
[31/01/2001 04:00:39:490] (INFO) Apache Module was cleaned-up

There are no (INFO) messages from wrapper_controller (in jserv_wrapper_win.c),
which is the only place that actually forwards a JSERV_SHUTDOWN control message 
to the Java process acting as the servlet engine.  Also, there are no messages
at all in the jserv.log file relating to the shutdown (which also indicates)
that the shutdown message doesn't get through to the Java process.
Most of the messages in the above extract are generated in wrapper_destroy,
which starts with:

int wrapper_destroy (wrapper_config *cfg) {
    int ret;

    /* Check our thread status and terminate it */
    if (wrapper_thread!=NULL) {
        if (wrapper_event!=NULL) {
            /* Post the quit message */
            SetEvent(wrapper_event);

            /* Wait 5 second for thread and process to terminate */
            ret=WaitForSingleObject(wrapper_thread,5000);

            /* Wait did not go thru... terminate the thread */
            if (ret!=WAIT_OBJECT_0) {
                TerminateThread(wrapper_thread,0);
                jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_INFO,cfg->config,"wrapper: %s",
                            "thread did not end, terminating it");
            }

So it seems that the SetEvent(wrapper_event) call is the one intended
to cause the JSERV_SHUTDOWN message to be sent, but it's not happening.
I guess that SetEvent is a call back into Apache proper---perhaps the
event loop has been disabled at this point in the shutdown process
which is why nothing happens as a result to the call to SetEvent.

State-Changed-Why:

Can you repeat this problem with Apache version 1.3.17?

I specifically ask because Apache 1.3.14 'lost' it's console
window when running as a service.  This caused havoc due
to Microsoft bugs in the child process mechanics that a
child not launched in the context of the parent's console
window is prone to bugs with it's standard handles, e.g.
stdin/stdout.  The pipes used for stdin/stdout communication
would not close properly or notify the parent that they had
been closed.

Please try 1.3.17 and report back.

 I installed 1.3.17 as soon as it was available in case it fixed the
 problem, but it didn't---behaviour is as for 1.3.14.
 
 Cheers, Paul.

State-Changed-Why:

This bug is corrected and will be gone in 1.3.20.

The server sent the correct messages from the wrong thread,
causing several modules shutdown issues.

Thank you for your report and interest in the Apache httpd
project!
