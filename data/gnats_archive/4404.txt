winnt 40 workstation service pack5
>Description:
Can not start apache server as described in the installation notes.
I also tried it on another machine running nt 40 workstation with service pack 5,and
it has the same problem. I loaded it on 2 other machines running nt 40
workstation with service pak 4 and apache starts up fine.
On the two machines running service pack 5 I am also running sygate server
on one and sygate client on the other. The were both upgraded to the sp5 version
of sygate 3.0. I also disabled the sygate services and reloaded apache
with the same results.
The other machines running service pack 4 do not have sygate software installed.

Could the problem be with service pack 5 ?
