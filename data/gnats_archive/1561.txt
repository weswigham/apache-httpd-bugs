>Environment:
HP-UX hpsl B.10.20 A 9000/712 2008928047 two-user license
Reading specs from /opt/gnu/lib/gcc-lib/hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20/2.7.2.1/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
hpux comes with a default nogroup
nogroup:*:-2:

however, Apache will not run with negative group number.
giving the following in the error_log file

[Tue Dec 16 11:59:17 1997] setgid: Invalid argument
[Tue Dec 16 11:59:17 1997] - unable to set group id
>How-To-Repeat:
You would need to run Apache on hpux to repeat.	
>Fix:
Either add comments to httpd.conf explaining the user/group ID needs to be
a positive number, add the information into the FAQ under "setgid: Invalid argument"
or create httpd.conf dynamically during the Configure process so that reaonsable
defaults are chosen for each OS

State-Changed-Why:
Apache isn't doing anything special with the GID; it's
calling the system's routines to use it.  Try creating
a user account with a negative GID and see if the system
will let you log onto it, and what an 'id' command says
after you're on.
