NT 4.0, Service Pack, i686 
>Description:
I downloaded both source and binary archives several times for release 1.3.1, 
1.3.0 and 1.2.6 for both NT and Linux.  Each time the winzip, gzip and Linux tar 
utilities are unable to recognize the archives. Also, no matter what the 
extension on the down index page,tar.Z or tar.gz, the file comes down as tar.tar
>How-To-Repeat:
Definitely.  It is quite painful to download this large archives several times 
on 33.6 modem!  http://www.apache.org/dist/

State-Changed-Why:
The problem is your web browser; Navigator and MSIE
both are broken when it comes to dealing with content-encodings
and do odd things with files.  They change the names and
may or may not unzip them regardless of the name.

The archives are fine.  You may wish to try with a ftp client
if you can't figure out what your web browser is doing.

 I realized the problem.  Despite the name on the HTML page (usually
 *_tar.Z or *_tar.gz), when the files come down to the NT machine, they
 end as "_tar.tar", but in reality they should be "*_tar.gz"   
  
 If you rename the file (as "*_tar.gz") then gunzip can properly unzip
 the file and then you can rename the file again so that it doesn't end
 with "_tar", but with ".tar"
 
 This allows "tar -xf" to work properly.
