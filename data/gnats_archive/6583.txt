15.Why do I get a "Forbidden/You don't have permission to access / on this server" message whenever I try to
       access my server? 

       Search your conf/httpd.conf file for this exact string (not including the quotation marks): "<Files ~>". If you find it, that's
       your problem -- that particular <Files> container is malformed. Delete it or comment it out and restart your server and things
       should work as expected. 

       This problem appears to be caused by an error in a repackaged version of Apache distributed by some vendor or other; we
       haven't determined the details yet.
