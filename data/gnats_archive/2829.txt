gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
>Description:
The suggested workaround to problem 2606 (semctl(IPC_SET): Bad address at
server startup) is to compile with -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.  This
fixes that problem but all ip entries in the access log are listed as
255.255.255.255

State-Changed-Why:
This problem seems to be caused by compilation with gcc 2.8.1
and derivatives. Newer version of Apache now use FCNTL locking
on this platform.

 I believe the wrong ip address is caused by an inet_ntoa
 incompatibility between gcc and the Irix libraries.  See 
 http://reality.sgi.com/ariel/freeware/gcc-2.8.1-notes.html
 
 "Gcc does not correctly pass/return structures which are smaller
 than 16 bytes and which are not 8 bytes.  The problem is very
 involved and difficult to fix.  It affects a number of other
 targets also, but irix6 is affected the most, because it is
 a 64 bit target, and 4 byte structures are common.
 The exact problem is that structures are being padded at the
 wrong end, e.g. a 4 byte structure is loaded into the lower
 4 bytes of the register when it should be loaded into the
 upper 4 bytes of the register."
 
 Gcc is consistent with itself, but not consistent with the SGI
 C compiler [and the SGI supplied runtime libraries],
 so the only failures that can happen are when there are
 library functions that take/return such structures.
 There are very few such library functions.
 I can only recall seeing a few of them:
 inet_ntoa, inet_aton, inet_lnaof, inet_netof,
 and semctl."
