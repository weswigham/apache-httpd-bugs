>Description:
Hello, dear sirs in Apache Group,
see a letter, which contained my proposal for Apache on my web-page at
   http://russiantigersoft.freeservers.com/diogen/letters/apachessi_en.htm
please. I cannot put my letter here because very long it for this form.

Note: I know that the Apache Project is a collaborative software development, and potentially I can realize my proposal oneself. But I aren't web-servers developer and I must take several month for learnt it. I cannot take so very long time for it. But your members can do it at several hours, if take it necessary, because it is their children and he known it very well.

Sincerely yours,
Andrew Micky,
programmer and web-master by The Russian Tiger Software

State-Changed-Why:

Folks nest SSI includes daily.  You must understand that
each include file="foo.file" is an actual sub-request.
This means that if it is an .html file, it will be served
with whatever handler is assigned to .html, if it is .shtml,
it will serve using that handler (usually ssi).

You asked to serve the file="foo.inc" and found that the
contents of foo.inc weren't processed as ssi.  That is the
correct behavior for apache.  You needed to associate the
.inc filetype with the ssi handler, or name your include
as an .shtml (or other recognized ssi file extention).

For these sorts of questions, please consult the group
news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
as this bug tracking database is for server errors alone,
not configuration problems or questions.

Thanks for your interest in the Apache httpd project!
