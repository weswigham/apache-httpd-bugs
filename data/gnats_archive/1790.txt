>Description:
My virtual hosts (actually host at the moment) is inheriting the rewrite rules
I've given my primary server.  This is contrary to the documentation, but I'm
guessing it is not the documentation at fault.

In my httpd.conf file I have (this has been abridged):
ServerType      standalone
HostnameLookups off
Listen          12.34.56.78:8000
Listen          12.34.56.90:80

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond   %{REQUEST_URI} !^/lc(/.*)?
RewriteCond   %{REQUEST_URI} !^/info(/.*)?
RewriteRule   ^/(([a-zA-Z0-9])[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+)/(.*) /sites/$2/$1/$3

<VirtualHost 12.34.56.90>
ServerName             foo.salu.net
ServerAdmin            webmaster@salu.net
AccessConfig           conf/adm-access.conf
ResourceConfig         conf/adm-srm.conf
ErrorLog               /var/web/logs/foo/error_log
TransferLog            /var/web/logs/foo/access_log
# RewriteEngine          off
</VirtualHost>

Unfortunately the rewrite rules are applied to my foo.salu.net on 12.34.56.90:80
site as well as my main web server on 12.34.56.78:8000
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
My workaround is to uncomment the RewriteEngine off directive in my VirtualHost
declaration, but according to the docs I shouldn't have to have that there.

State-Changed-Why:
It is a very subtle bug in the way the virtual server
config for modules are created and merged. I currently
don't know a solution to this, but I'm searching for
one... 

To make the problem clear:

If there is at least one directive of a module, the per-server config-merging function is
used and thus can merge correctly.  Mod_rewrite here does its job correct
because it initialized the per-server config with "engine disabled" and merges
this correctly. But now when no mod_rewrite directive exists in such a
<VirtualHost> section, it seems like mod_rewrite is never called (which in
general is fine). But then mod_rewrite cannot create a special per-server
config for this particular virtual host (where the engine would be disabled
per default) and thus the config of the main server is applied to this virtual
host.

 Yeah one way to hack around this is to put:
 
     server_rec *created_in;
 
 into your server config.  Then during your create_server_config routine
 initialize it to the server you're created in.
 
 Then later on during run time you can compare r->server to
 your_config->created_in and if they're different you can assume whatever
 defaults you want to.
 
 It's an ugly part of the API.

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed for 1.3b6 now the way Dean mentioned.
We remember the server and then on-the-fly assume
we have the default config if the remembered server
and the calling server mismatch.
