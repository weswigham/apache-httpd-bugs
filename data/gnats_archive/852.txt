SunOS sunflo 5.5 Generic sun4c sparc SUNW,Sun_4_50
>Description:
I have a server which runs with (currently) no virtual hosts. I specify the bind address with the fully qualified domain name (on my LAN) I have given my server. This domain name is not internet accessible because it is on my LAN. I have the host setup to be the root, top level domain, and second level domain dns server.

Here is the bind address config:

httpd.conf excerpt:
-----
BindAddress www.drh.tld.
-----

Here is a lookup of that domain name showing that it does exist:

-----
sunflo:/opt/AGapache/logs## dig www.drh.tld.

Or nslookup if you prefer:

-----

sunflo:/opt/AGapache/logs## nslookup www.drh.tld.
Server:  sunflo.drh.tld
Address:  192.168.0.4

Name:    www.drh.tld
Address:  192.168.0.4
-----

And when I try to start the server it says:

-----
sunflo:/opt/AGapache/src## ./httpd -f /opt/AGapache/conf/httpd.conf
Cannot resolve host name www.drh.tld. --- exiting!
-----

So, I go ahead and give it the IP as the server address and then it does not die at that directive. Instead it finds trouble with the ServerName directive which I have set to be "www.drh.tld."

httpd.conf excerpt:
-----
ServerName www.drh.tld.
-----

Here is how it complains. It looks like the server starts up and then dies because that other prompt came up.

-----
sunflo:/opt/AGapache/src## ./httpd -f /opt/AGapache/conf/httpd.conf
sunflo:/opt/AGapache/src## httpd: cannot determine the IP address of the specified ServerName (www.drh.tld.).
-----

If I then change the ServerName to be the IP, the server starts up fine. But, it looks like it is not doing reverse DNS queries even though I told it to.

Weird.

I don't know. If you want access to my system through telnet, I'll give it to you.

No idea

 What happens if you use nslookup rather than dig to access that name?  And
 can you ping the name?
 
 The reason that I ask is that Sun has always had "interesting" ideas how
 to do name resolution, and dig completely bypasses all of a sun box's
 normal resolution routines.  Whereas nslookup will go through them
 (sometimes)... but ping and telnet definately go through the same
 resolution procedures apache will use, so they're better tests.
