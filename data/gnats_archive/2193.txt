All images will load either fully, or partialy. If the images load partialy (bottoms of the images will be cut off with a black or grey bar)

We have seen this on many versions of IE from 3.X-4.X and from Netscape 2.X-4.X for both the mac and windows platforms.

Coppying an offending image to a different file name, and then loading that file sometimes yields a good image, sometimes not.

Server has 192 meg of ram, 4 gig etc. I have 4 httpds that have 1 site each on them, and another that has aprox 55.

 Do you have the latest patch cluster from Sun applied?

 I had writen you yesterday and said I thought all patches were installed. I
 checked with sunsite, and found that a cluster was released on May 2. I
 installed the patches, rebooted, and still the problem exists.
 
 Also in that time, I have further split the httpd that was serving 56 sites to
 7 httpds with 8 sites each. That gives us a total of 11 different httpds
 running on the machine, 7 with 8, and 4 with 1.
 
 Do I need to recompile apache with the patches installed?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark

 Here is update #2.
 
 I have installed & compiled gcc 2.8.1 and recompiled apache 1.2.6 (it's
 smaller then with the previous rev of gcc)
 
 The problem still exists.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark

 Ahh...A new twist.
 
 On a lark, I installed a very old version of Apache, 1.1.3 to be exact. 
 And lo and behold, the problem goes away! The images load perfectly fine,
 and all is well.
 
 I also d/led a trial version of Netscape's server. Same files, & same
 directory tree, the files load perfectly fine.
 
 Also for fun, I downloaded the binary from the apache site of 1.2.5. It
 too exhibits the problem.
 
 So as it stands now, it seems that the problem exists with the 1.2.5-1.2.6
 revs of the server. 
 
 Any ideas?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark

 Can you try earlier 1.2.x releases?  I'll make them available for the time
 being through here:

 Brian,
 
 I received from your pages the src for 1.2.0, 1.2.1, and 1.2.3. I compiled
 all three using gcc version 2.8.1.
 
 All three versions, in addition to 1.2.5 & 1.2.6, all produced broken
 graphics.
 
 THe url I used for this was: http://www.convey-it.com/products.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark

State-Changed-Why:
[There's a reason we ask that you Cc the <apbugs@Apache.Org>
address.. so your reply will get attached to the report.]

The 200 status indicates that the server successfully
sent all of the information (or thinks it did).  How does
the transaction size compare to the actualy byte-count of
the image?

Well, if the problem doesn't occur with 1.3b6, then the
cause appears to have been fixed.  (BTW, are there any
common features among the problem images?  Such as,
are they all GIF89A interlaced, and JPEGs always work?
Or anything like that?)

I realise that running beta software can be scary, but
1.3.0 is fairly close to release.  In addition, a lot
of very high profile sites use the latest beta, so I
wouldn't be *too* concerned.  I think that 1.3.0 will be
out with its fix before the fix is determined and added
to 1.2, so I suggest that you hang on a little longer -
a matter of weeks only.  Whether you stay with 1.2 and
the known bug of broken images, or stay on 1.3b6 with
its beta status, fix for the image issue, and potential
other unknown bugs.. well, you need to make the call.  I'd
suggest the latter, though, personally.  Thanks for using
Apache!
