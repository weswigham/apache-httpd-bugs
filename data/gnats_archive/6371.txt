>Description:
On a server-parsed document if the user enters a url like
http://www.pdp8.net/index.shtml/ instead of the proper 
http://www.pdp8.net/index.shtml the page will be fetched but all the
relative links will be relative to /index.shtml/ such as 
run.html becoming /index.shtml/run.shtml.

If server-parsed is turned off then you get a file does not exist error
instead of the index.shtml file (Which I think is correct).

Config file info
DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.shtml index.cgi
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
<Directory "/mnt/wing/apache/share/htdocs">
    Options +Includes
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.pdp8.net/index.shtml/
The index.shtml file is available as http://www.pdp8.net/err.html if 
you wish to see the page source.  The machine is running 1.3.9 but I
did test on another 1.3.12.
