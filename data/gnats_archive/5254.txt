>Description:
This URL works when it should not:

http://www.franz.com/index.html/xyz.html.

There is no file index.html/xyz.html

I'm trying this test on a mirror of the same site (on a different host) and
apache properly reports error 404 in that case.  The only important difference
that I can think of between the two apaches is that the one that doesn't
work properly has server-side includes turned on for all .html files.

State-Changed-Why:
That is the correct behaviour and has been mentioned
numerous times in the bugdb, although it is a hard thing
to search for.

If you have SSIs enabled, then it is perfectly legitimate
to add extra path info at the end of a URL that the SSI can
use for whatever purposes it wishes to.
