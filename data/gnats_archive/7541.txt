Solaris 8; Ultra-60;gcc 2.95
>Description:
when executing make with SOLARIS 8 out of the box and PATH including /usr/local/bin for gcc, make produces the error:
ar cr libos.a os.o os-inline.o
make[1]: ar: Command not found
make[1]: ***[libos.a] Error 127
make: ***[subdirs] Error 1
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Suggest adding a FAQ in the appropriate section to state that the PATH must include /usr/ccs/bin. I modified my PATH and all went O.K.

State-Changed-Why:

I agree that this is somewhat of a FAQ, but I am loath
to add this information to the Apache FAQ because we
really don't want to get into documenting every possible
thing that can go wrong in a build system.  
The "/usr/ccs/bin" location is only appropriate for
Solaris, so what you are really asking us to do is add
an entry saying "make sure that all your build tools
are in your PATH".  I don't really want to do that.

When we update the build docs for Apache 2.0, I'll
try to make sure that it includes a comment about
checking your PATH.

Thanks for using Apache!
