>Description:
Hi,

This bug is being submitted both to XFS and Apache bug reporting systems.

First thank you all at SGI for the great work. RH-71 with XFS root installed nicely on my laptop.

Now my problem : I have been taking a look at XFS ACLs, and there seem to be a problem with apache not taking XFS ACLs into account.

Details :

Software versions : stock RH-71 with XFS-1.0 install disk, Apache-1.3.19

Problem : say I have a user called gwen, with home directory /home/gwen. Apache is running under apache.apache and user home directories are configured to be readable as ~gwen for /home/gwen/public_html. Apache indexes on index.html.

If I set the following perms, without any ACLs, everything is working fine :
drwxr-xr-x	root	root	/home
drwx-----x	gwen	gwen	/home/gwen
drwx---r-x	gwen	gwen	/home/gwen/public_html
-rwx---r--	gwen	gwen	/home/gwen/public_html/index.html

I have access to index.html, which prints out a nice "Hello, World!" ;-).


If I want to be more restrictive, and use ACLs to allow access to this file only to the user named apache, and/or (tried both) to the group named apache, I get a 403 Forbidden error from apache.

Permissions are set the following way :
drwxr-xr-x	root	root	/home
drwx------	gwen	gwen	/home/gwen
drwx------	gwen	gwen	/home/gwen/public_html
-rwx------	gwen	gwen	/home/gwen/public_html/index.html

and the following ACLs are set too, for the user apache, group apache :
d--x--x---	apache	apache	/home/gwen
dr-xr-x---	apache	apache	/home/gwen/public_html
-r-xr-x---	apache	apache	/home/gwen/public_html/index.html

I don't know whether I did something wrong in ACL settings. I think it has to do with the way Apache checks for perms.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just configure a "normal" apache on a Linux/XFS system.
>Fix:
Beware ! I am in no way a C expert nor an Apache source code expert. The following hint is just my understanding of the problem after wandering through the code.

I think this is because Apache does its own permission check (using stat) before opening the file. Trying to fopen the file even if apache perm check failed might solve the problem.
