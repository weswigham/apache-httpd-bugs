>Description:
To trigger this bug, install an Apache server with the mod_proxy enabled. We
use mod_proxy for reverse proxy, it is as yet unclear whether the bug is
triggered by only mod_proxy or the use of reverse proxy features.

Over time, children httpd processes get "stuck", in that they ignore requests to
restart, both gracefully (USR1), firmly (HUP) or forcefully (TERM). These
processes are "stuck" listening for new connections (as they should) but the
screwed up signals mean that these processes never receive their new connection,
and sit around for ever.

If the Apache parent is asked to "restart" with -SIGHUP, Apache tries to USR1,
TERM, then KILL the stuck processes. If the Apache parent is asked to
"graceful"ly restart processes that are "stuck" are not cleaned up or killed.
Over time more processes are spawned to do the job of the "stuck" clients until
MaxClients is reached.

A workaround to this problem is to downgrade the src/modules/proxy directory to
the code in v1.3.6 of Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
An analysis of a diff between v1.3.6 and v1.3.7-dev of 19990604131214 indicates
that the problem probably lies with the new improved garbage collection code.

There is mention of code that fiddles with the signals to ensure that garbage
collections, now done in a separate forked process, are not interrupted by
signals.

It's likely that this code is setting signal handling to ignore, which is then
blocking that process off from the rest of the world.
