  <p><b>NEW YORK</b> (Tuesday, January 8, 2002) - - Major League Soccer Commissioner 
         Don Garber announced today that the Tampa Bay Mutiny and the Miami Fusion 
         will immediately cease operations. The decision to close both teams was 
         made unanimously by the MLS Board of Governors, after a comprehensive 
         strategic review of the League's operations.</p>
       <p> The League also announced that it is in continuing negotiations with 
         several entities to invest in MLS and acquire the operating rights of 
         the Dallas Burn and San Jose Earthquakes. An announcement is intended 
         in both markets prior to the beginning of the season.<br>
         <br>
         Additionally, the League announced that the Anschutz Entertainment Group 
         has exercised its option to become the Investor-Operator of D.C. United. 
         When these transactions are completed, the League will for the first time 
         have an Investor-Operator for every MLS team.</p>
       <p>Finally, the League has made significant changes to its operating relationship 
         with its teams. These adjustments will provide enhanced revenue opportunities 
         at the local level by allowing teams to retain a greater share of revenue 
         from ticket sales, local sponsorship and television.</p>
       <p>These changes follow the announcement on December 6, 2001 that MLS investors 
         committed to funding and operating the league for the next five years, 
         through the 2006 season. The six-year old League also announced last week 
         a five-year extension of its broadcast agreement with ABC and ESPN to 
         televise a significant schedule of MLS games. At the same time, the League 
         announced the formation of a new marketing and production company which 
         purchased the rights to the 2002 World Cup, 2003 Women's World Cup and 
         the 2006 World Cup and an agreement with ABC and ESPN to broadcast all 
         three of these World Cup tournaments in the United States (English language).</p>
       <p> &quot;Our investors have made a number of strategic decisions that will 
         better position MLS in the short and long term,&quot; Commissioner Garber 
         said. &quot;These decisions took many months to finalize and were enormously 
         complex and involved, but are necessary to ensure the future success of 
         the League. While we are reducing the number of teams by two for now, 
         the long-term funding commitment, media commitments, new investment and 
         the fact that all teams will have Investor-Operators will make MLS a stronger 
         and more viable league going forward.&quot;</p>
       <p>The MLS Board of Governors has determined that all teams must have an 
         Investor-Operator to manage and fund local operations. The League and 
         Board of Governors thoroughly evaluated all teams and markets, based on 
         their ability to provide value to the league and the sport overall for 
         the long-term. Factors that were considered in the decision-making process 
         included ownership status, past market performance, market potential, 
         and the soccer appropriateness of the local stadium. </p>
       <p>&quot;The decision to leave both cities for the 2002 MLS Season was extremely 
         difficult,&quot; said MLS Commissioner Garber. &quot;I can assure all 
         of our fans that we worked tirelessly to find a plan that would have allowed 
         us to remain in both markets. We simply could not find a solution that 
         was economically feasible at this time and we hope to return to the State 
         of Florida when the League expands in future years.&quot;</p>
       <p>Major League Soccer's investors include Philip Anschutz of Denver, the 
         Hunt family of Dallas, the Kraft family of Boston, Kenneth Horowitz, Alan 
         Rothenberg and the global advertising agency, Dentsu. The Anschutz Entertainment 
         Group (AEG) is the Investor-Operator of the Chicago Fire, Colorado Rapids, 
         D.C. United, Los Angeles Galaxy, and the MetroStars. The Hunt family is 
         the Investor-Operator of the Columbus Crew and Kansas City Wizards. The 
         Kraft family is the Investor-Operator of the New England Revolution. The 
         additional shareholders are investors in the entire League, but do not 
         have operating rights to a specific team. </p>
       <p>The deciding factor for not continuing operations of the Tampa Bay Mutiny 
         is the fact that the team has not had an investor-operator since it began 
         play in 1996. The Mutiny have been operated and funded by the League Office 
         since its inception.</p>
       <p> In Miami, the MLS Board of Governors, along with Investor-Operator Ken 
         Horowitz, who founded the Miami Fusion as an expansion team in 1998, have 
         determined that the local market is not capable at this time of providing 
         the support necessary to effectively sustain a Major League Soccer team. 
         Both the League and the team worked throughout the 2001 season to bolster 
         the team's support from the local community. Even with an Eastern Conference 
         Championship and increases at the gate, the team remained among the lowest 
         in League average attendance, corporate support and overall revenues. 
       </p>
       <p>Mr. Horowitz will remain an investor in the League, with an option of 
         returning as an operator in South Florida or an expansion market.</p>
       <p>&quot;There are few owners in professional sports who dedicated themselves 
         to their team as Ken Horowitz did the Fusion,&quot; said MLS Investor-Operator, 
         Lamar Hunt. &quot;He tried so hard to make it work in South Florida and 
         all of us in Major League Soccer greatly appreciate his passion and commitment 
         to the game.&quot; <br>
         <br>
         &quot;Ken Horowitz contributed so much to the League and the sport in 
         South Florida,&quot; added MLS Commissioner Don Garber. &quot;I know the 
         pain and sorrow he feels to no longer be associated with the Fusion. He 
         gave every effort over the past years to create a team that represented 
         the community with pride, personality and public service.&quot;</p>
       <p>MLS will feature a 10-team, two conference alignment for the 2002 season. 
         The Eastern Conference will consist of the Chicago Fire, Columbus Crew, 
         D.C. United, the MetroStars and the New England Revolution. The Western 
         Conference makeup will consist of the Colorado Rapids, Dallas Burn, Kansas 
         City Wizards, Los Angeles Galaxy and defending MLS Cup champion San Jose 
         Earthquakes. </p>
       <p class="sectionhead">MLS Will Conduct Allocation/Dispersal Drafts of all 
         Tampa and Miami Players</p>
       <p>In conjunction with this announcement, MLS will conduct a Dispersal Draft 
         of the Tampa Bay and Miami rosters on Friday, January, 11. All former 
         Fusion and Mutiny players will be placed into a Dispersal Draft pool, 
         along with all first round picks in the 2002 SuperDraft held by Miami 
         and Tampa Bay. All lower 2002 SuperDraft picks held by these teams (other 
         than picks they may have previously traded away) will be eliminated, including 
         any picks for which the teams had traded.</p>
       <p>Immediately prior to the Dispersal Draft, teams due allocations for the 
         2002 season will participate in an Allocation Draft and may select any 
         one player/pick on the Dispersal Draft list per allocation. </p>
       <p>The MLS Competition Committee has approved the allocations and selection 
         order for those allocations as follows: Colorado (failure to make the 
         2001 MLS Cup Playoffs); New England (failure to make the MLS Playoffs); 
         DC United (failure to make the MLS Playoffs); Colorado (Unused 2001 allocation); 
         New England (loss of Leonel Alvarez and Mauricio Wright); New England 
         (loss of William Sunsing); Dallas (retirement of Lubos Kubik); Los Angeles 
         (loss of Luis Hernandez); and San Jose (unused 2001 allocation). </p>
