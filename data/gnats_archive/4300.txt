Disabling WANTHSREGEX got past that particular problem but there were more after that.

In the Configuration files there are 2 different defaults for WANTHSREGEX:
from
#  out the Rule. The "default" action is "no" unless overruled
#  by OS specifics

Rule WANTHSREGEX=default


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#  not use this one by setting WANTHSREGEX to 'no' or commenting
#  out the Rule. The "default" action is "yes" unless overruled
#  by OS specifics

Rule WANTHSREGEX=no    <<<<<--- tried this many ways...

State-Changed-When: Mon Jun  8 10:22:19 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
What specific steps did you follow to try compile? What
were the specific error messages you got when compiling?
State-Changed-From-To: feedback-closed

State-Changed-When: Thu Jun 11 14:26:49 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Your compiler is not properly installed.  Either try installing
your compiler again, and follow all the instructions, or
ask for help in a Linux support forum.  It is complaining that
your header files don't match up properly; nothing to do
with Apache.
