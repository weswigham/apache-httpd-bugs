>Release:        1.3b3
>Environment:
Linux version 2.1.71 (root@merv) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) i586
	
>Description:
When I serve a page (by cgi) that works fine with apache 1.2.4
but use apache 1.3b3, my linux box hangs.  This is moderately 
repeatable, and the hang is sudden, with no log information
anywhere.  Obviously this is at least partly a problem with 
linux, but I thought I'd pass it along.	
>How-To-Repeat:
I get it in a running log page: log in as a new user with any username at
  merv.philosophy.lsa.umich.edu/~markcrim/WorkoutLog.html
This should give you a two-month calendar page.  The system freeze happens
near the top (before the calendar tables are loaded).
>Fix:
Sorry, I'm an idiot

State-Changed-When: Sat Dec 13 17:21:31 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
I'm closing this because I don't trust linux 2.1.71, since it's a
development kernel.  If you can reproduce it with a known stable
kernel then please open a new PR.

Thanks for using Apache!
