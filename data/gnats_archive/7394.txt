Windows NT 4.0 SP5 Russian Edition, Apache 1.3.19 (binary dist. taken from httpd.apache.org)
>Description:
As the manual says, default setting for AllowOverride parameter in httpd.conf is All (see manual/mod/core.html#allowoverride), but in the httpd.conf generated by Apache installer it is set to None for all directories. My .htaccess files get ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install Apache on the clean system and RT(F)M to compare...
>Fix:
Yes..

State-Changed-When: Thu Mar 15 23:43:29 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

The "Default" listed in the docs gives the setting that
will apply if no instances of that directive are present
in the config files.  It does not give the setting
that will apply with the default config files, since it
is assumed that people will read and modify these.

I agree it is not crystal clear, but I'm not sure how
to improve it.

Thanks for using Apache!
