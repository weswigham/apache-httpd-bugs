>Description:
Hi,

I use a 1.3.12 Apache Web Server with a default charset = utf-8 
(after modification as written in cf. PR 5872). 
When I use characters with accents (french characters) in JavaScript, the web server
returns some wrong characters. I know that if I write '$eacute' instead of 'é', 
it will be OK. But as most of fields come from database, I have to make it work 
with french utf-8 characters.
Do you have any idea to solve that problem ?

Thanks.
Julien Petitot.

Thanks for using Apache!
