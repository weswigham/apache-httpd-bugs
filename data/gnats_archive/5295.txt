>Environment:
OS: RedHat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5-22) w/ all released RedHat security patches.
JDK: 1.1.7B (Blackdown 1.1.7-v3) or 1.1.8 (IBM JDK 1.1.8)
JSDK 2.0 (Sun)
JServ: 1.1b3
>Description:
I'm sorry if this is already mentioned in the FAQ for JServ but its been 
inaccessible for the last two days...

I've just spent the day trying to install Apache JServ 1.1b3 over Apache 1.3.6, 
JSDK2.0, and JDK 1.1.7B (also tried JDK 1.1.8).  All attempts to access the
example servlets ('Hello' and 'IsItWorking') result in a 'Bad Request' error in
the browser and 'ajp11: Servlet Error: malformed data sent to JServ' in the
mod_jserv.log file.

It turns out the default installation of JServ has a misconfiguration in the
'/example/jserv.conf' file.  Making the default protocol 'ajpv12' instead of
'ajpv11' fixes the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just follow the install instructions for Apache JServ 1.1b3 and try to access
the URL <http://[yourserver]/example/Hello>.
>Fix:
After a day of beating my head against a wall (cause I didn't know what I was
doing and the FAQ was done), I discovered that the problem is that the 
example's 'jserv.conf' file has the line:
  ApJServDefaultProtocol ajpv11

This just needs to be changed to
  ApJServDefaultProtocol ajpv12

And the problem goes away.
