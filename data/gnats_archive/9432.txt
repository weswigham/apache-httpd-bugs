     St. John's University men's soccer coach Dave Masur, who led the Red Storm to the NCAA Final Four and to their sixth BIG EAST Tournament Championship, was named Soccer America Coach of the Year, it was announced today.
 
 This is the second time in his 11 years at St. John's that Masur has earned national coach of the year honors. The first came in 1996, when Masur was tabbed by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, after leading the Red Storm to a 22-2-2 re cord and the University's first-ever national championship.
 
 In 11 years at St. John's, Masur has made the Red Storm men's soccer programs one of the elite in the country. His teams have won 10 BIG EAST Championships (regular season or tournament) and he is the all-time winningest coach at St. John's carrying a re cord of 176-44-26 (.768). 
 
 Masur developed his coaching prowess from long-time Rutgers coach Bob Reasso. A 1984 graduate of Rutgers, Masur was a two-time All-American and an assistant coach for two years under Reasso.
 
 Soccer America also honored recent graduate Shalrie Joseph (Brooklyn, N.Y.), naming him one of 11 College Men's Most Valuable Players. Joseph, a two-time first-team All-BIG EAST selection and third team All-American, finished his two-year career with 21  goals and six assists for 48 points. After leading the team in scoring during the 2000 season (14 goals, two assists, 30 points, the fifth-best single-season mark in SJU history), Joseph played mainly at sweeper this season, but still managed seven goals  and four assists. His 21 career goals ranks 10th all-time at St. John's.
 
 The Red Storm will play in a new on-campus stadium during the 2002 season.
 
 There are still a few spots open for the Met Oval / Brooklyn Knights Tournament to be held at the Paerdegat Athletic Complex, in Brooklyn.  We are looking to fill only a couple spots to have the tournament completely sold-out.  Here is what we need: 
 Jan 12th - U10 - Sold Out,             Jan 13th - U11 - 1 Team,
 Jan 19th - U12 - 1 team,             Jan 20th - U13 - 2 teams, 
 Jan 26th - U14 - 1 Team,              Jan 27th - U15 - 1 team, 
 Feb 2nd -  U16 - 2 teams,             Feb 3rd  - U17 - 1 team, 
 
 Just a reminder, they are only boy divisions.  Each team will be guarenteed eight games consisting of 12 minutes per game.  Cost for the tournament is only $150.  For more information call Gali Maimon at (718)444-0406, or e-mail him at gali40@hotmail.com
