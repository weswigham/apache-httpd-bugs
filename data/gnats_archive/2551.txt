>Description:
When configuring with --prefix=/usr/local (i.e., a directory which
does not contain "apache" somewhere in its full path), libexecdir is
set by default to /usr/local/libexec while others like datadir are set
to /usr/local/share/apache.  It is common practice for packages which
have several files to install in /usr/local/libexec to create their
own subdirectory (emacs and octave, for instance).

There are several reasons why this should also be the case for apache:

. several files are installed
. it's hard for someone to just guess that mod_include.so is an apache
  file (in other words, none of the .so file contain apache in their name)
. nothing else than apache needs these files (which is not the case for
  libraries which are installed directly in /usr/local/lib)
. apache already does it for etc, include, share, and var (but not
  bin, sbin, and man, which is ok:  that's common practice too)

(I am aware of the --libexecdir option to configure.  I just think
this suggestion would be the best default for those who use /usr/local
instead of /usr/local/apache.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure with --prefix=/usr/local.
>Fix:
Here's a patch to configure.  Makefile.tmpl may also need to be
changed in the way it ajusts conf/httpd.conf-dist before installation.

State-Changed-Why:
You're right, libexecdir should be treated the same
way as the other dirs like sysconfdir, etc.
We've comitted your patch for Apache 1.3.1.
