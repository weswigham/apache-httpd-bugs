>Description:
I have set up a .htpasswd file using htpasswd. When asked for authentification, I enter valid username/password combination. Login is rejected. Log file displays: 
[Thu Nov 12 11:26:10 1998] [error] [client XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX] user swoolley: password mismatch: /secdir

I know I am finding the correct .htpasswd file because if I enter a bogus usename, it displays:
[Thu Nov 12 10:28:58 1998] [error] [client XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX] user foo not found: /secdir

State-Changed-Why:
Could you please post the block of the configuration you're
using for password authorization?

Also, if possible, could you set up a non-sensitive section
of your web server with a username and password, then
send us the username and password and the (hopefully one line)
password file that you get from the htpasswd tool? We can
then narrow down exactly where the failure is occuring
