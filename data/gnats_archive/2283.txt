>Description:
For some modules (mod_log_mysql)to get running, 
we need these small changes in the files above:

diff http_main.c http_main.c_org: 
326c326
< //static pool *pconf;         /* Pool for config stuff */
---
> static pool *pconf;           /* Pool for config stuff */
835c835
< API_EXPORT(void) timeout(int sig)
---
> static void timeout(int sig)

diff http_main.h http_main.h_org:
110,112d109
< static pool *pconf;           /* Pool for config stuff */
< API_EXPORT(void) timeout(int sig);
< 
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile mod_log_mysql after fixing the api names
>Fix:

State-Changed-Why:
You will have to be more explicit about why these changes
are required.  I do not see the need to expose timeout()
offhand or why you are moving pconf to a .h file.

These changes are almost certainly not correct and are probably
caused by the module in question doing things it shouldn't
be.  The solution is more likely to fix the module.

 For example, if you're exposing timeout() because you want to install a
 sigpipe/alrm handler and then restore timeout() later then you should use
 the result from signal() itself... as in:
 
     void (*old_handler)(int) = signal(SIGALRM, SIG_IGN);
 
     ...
 
     signal(SIGALRM, old_handler);
 
 And pconf is already available to modules.  It is the pool passed to the
 init() method in the module_rec.
