State-Changed-Why:
When you say "DBI" you're referring to a module you've added
to apache, right?  If so there's not much we can do about
it... perhaps you should report the problem to the module
author.  Feel free to open another problem if you've got
specifics where apache goes wrong.

Thanks for choosing apache!
