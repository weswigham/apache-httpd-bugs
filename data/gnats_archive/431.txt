>Description:
  The documentation says that all mod_dir directives are allowed
  in the server config, <VirtualHost>, <Directory>, <Location>, <Files>
  and in .htaccess files, but using them in either <Directory>, <Location>
  or <Files> has no effect.
  With .htaccess files this works, but only if they are not used
  in a <Files> directive.

State-Changed-Why:
Hmm, I gave it a test and it appears to work as expected.
Do you have "AllowOverride" set for "Indexes"?  It sounds
like you don't.
