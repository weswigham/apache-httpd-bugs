>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional, Service Pack 2 (with several pre-SP3 fixes as prescribed by Windows Update)
>Description:
I have the /stats/server-status location set to the mod_status (server-status) handler. DNS lookups are disabled, and don't occur in any other instances except when I request the server status page. It tends not to lookup the first request, but subsequent almost always get looked up.

I've been able to replicate this on another server with both remote and local (same computer as server) requests for the page. I've also replicated the problem with the HTTP authentication directives commented out.

This isn't a major problem, it just trips up my (and others', I assume) statistics gatherers.


Clipping from httpd.conf:
   [...]
   HostnameLookups Off
   ExtendedStatus On
   [...]
   <Location /stats/server-status>
     SetHandler server-status
     Order deny,allow
     Deny from all
     Allow from ese.ogi.edu
     AuthType Basic
     AuthName "Web Stats"
     Require user admin
   </Location>
>How-To-Repeat:
If you setup the server status location and refresh a few times on a server with HostnameLookups disabled, it will become apparent.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... you explicitly put a requirement that users be accessing the server from *.ese.ogi.edu in your config.  So of course Apache has to do a DNS lookup to see if that requirement is satisfied...

The hostnamelookups directive just controls if lookups will be done when they are not otherwise required.  If they are required for access control, etc. then Apache has to do them.

 That's because of your "Allow from ese.ogi.edu".  When you have a
 DNS-based access directive like this, mod_access is forced to do a
 DNS lookup even if you've turned them off for the general case.
 Without performing a DNS lookup, it has no way to know whether the client
 is in the "ese.ogi.edu" domain or not.  You should change to the
 "Allow from 123.456." form, where 123.456. is your IP subnet.
