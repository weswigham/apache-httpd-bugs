>Release:        1.3.3
>Environment:
64bit Solaris 7, Developer release of SC5.0, compiled with -xarch=v9
SunOS hoth 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-30
>Description:
I am using the following .htaccess file:
<Limit GET POST>
    order deny,allow
    deny from all
    allow from 130.167
    allow from 127.0.0.1
</Limit>

The line "allow from 130.167" was not allowing access from that network range.
I found that I was getting sign extension from int to long when using 64bit
longs under Solaris 7 (-xarch=v9) on the following line in mod_access.c:

            a->x.ip.net |= octet << shift;

I fixed the problem by replacing this line with:
            a->x.ip.net |= ((unsigned int)octet) << shift;

Also the problem is not corrected by call to ntohl in LP64 mode in Solaris 7
since it does not force the return value to be uint32_t (Sun SO #3676781).
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile apache under 64bit Solaris 7 with the development version of SC5.0 and
use the -xarch=v9 flag during compilation/link to generate a 64bit executable.
>Fix:
See above.  Also you can get around the problem by including a netmask in the
.htaccess file.
