openssl
>Description:
We use Outlook Web Access on IIS4 Server (asp requests).
HTTPS protocol is used (SSL2).
When we are on Internet and we try to open or download an attachment with IE, there's an error : "The file could not be written to the cache" or "Internet Explorer cannot download from the Internet site File_name from Computer_name. 
The download file is not available. This could be due to your Security or Language settings or because the server was unable to retrieve the requested file. "

When we are on Internet and we try to open or download an attachment with Netscape Communicator 4.7, it's fine.

When we are on the local network (we don't pass by Apach server) we can download/open attachments with IE or Netscape.

Number of asp requests is the same in both cases.

Have you any idea ??
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately you can't reproduce this problem because of the authentication by securID.
>Fix:
Problem looks like http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/4118 but problem still exists with IE5.01.
BrowserMatch is configured : <BrowserMatch "MSIE " nokeepalive>

State-Changed-Why:
Questions:

You are using Apache as your proxy, correct?

What authorization scheme are you passing through the 
Apache proxy?

Do you have access to a packet sniffer that you can dump
a ---very small--- example of this problem, as exchanged
between the server and client, each with NS 4.7 and IE?
