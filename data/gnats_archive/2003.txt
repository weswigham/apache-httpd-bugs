>Description:
If apache is running and I change the configuration file (I've consolidated
everything into httpd.conf) and restart using "kill -HUP procID", apache
seems to restart, but it continues to use the old configuration information.

If I type:
"kill procID ; /usr/local/apache_1.2.5/bin/httpd -f /usr/local/apache_1.2.5/conf/httpd.conf"
the configuration changes are detected.

This seems to be an issue specific to NetBSD.  At least, I haven't seen it
on any other OSs.  I'm not familiar enough with NetBSD to guess why it happens.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
As above.  Don't use "kill -HUP".  kill the process completely and restart

State-Changed-Why:
Odd.  Do you get any indication that the server ever receives
the HUP signal at all?  E.g., if you rename the .conf file
and -HUP it, the server should fail since it can't find its conf
file.  But if it's not getting the HUP signal then it won't
even try to reload.  If it's not getting the HUP signal that
could be an OS problem.

Also, does -USR1 work?  That's a "graceful restart".
