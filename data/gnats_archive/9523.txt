Headline: Protecting System Settings

...
Allow from all
...
This stops all overrides, Includes and accesses in all directories apart from those named.

'Allow from all' doesn't stop all accesses!
it should be 'Deny from all'
>How-To-Repeat:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/security_tips.html#systemsettings

- Allow from all<br />
+ Deny from all<br />
