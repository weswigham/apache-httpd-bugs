More curious stuff here...

Telnet to port 80 on the machine (i.e. telnet localhost 80) and simply
leaving the connection open without typing anything behaves as it
should: Apache closes the connection after the Timeout period.  When
I telnet to the machine from a different host (othermachine# telnet
machinename 80) the connection will never be closed by Apache, and that
slot is forever hosed in a "...reading..." state when viewing the
server-status page.

Assuming this to be a Solaris issue, I went and got all the recommended
patches from Sun for Solaris 2.6.  After installing and rebooting the
machine, it behaved normally for awhile.

But a day later hung servers are there again, thus I assume the reboot
probably made things work rather than the patches from sun.

I know there are LOTS of issues with Solaris (after looking at the
apache source tree) ... my guess is something to do with the networking
stuff in Solaris.
