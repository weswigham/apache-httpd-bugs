linux 2.2.5-15 & linx 2.2.5-22
>Description:
Apache dies (usually taking down the entire machine) with "Invalid argument: accept: (client socket)".  This usually (but not always) happens after a restart. The machine is reasonably loaded (10-30 hits per second) This happens on a variety of Linux machines (we have 8 in our server farm) and it seems to happen on all machines.

sometimes a restart will fix it
