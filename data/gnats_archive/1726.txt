Apache is not in default directory (I cannot get it started as a service.)  
Apache started as Administrator user  
(Pentium120, 64MB RAM)
>Description:
I suspect this is the same problem described in PR1607 and PR1129.  Apache 
hangs on a request about once per day.  The only way to get any further is 
to kill the process.  The problem is intermittent and does not seem to depend 
on the script in question, so it is difficult to reproduce.  However, the 
problem is basically making Apache unusable as a server for us.  (Please help, 
we would much rather use Apache than IIS...)

Note:  I could not use your pre-built binary, it generates 500 errors: premature
end of script...  (So I had to make the executable myself.)

Sorry.  It is sporadic.  Just try a lot of scripts over and over again?

No. Wish I did

 Are you sure it is not simply after so many CGI scripts have been run?  In
 1.3b3 there is a file descriptor leak.  Check the number of file handles
 used in the performance monitor and you will probably find that they are
 increasing until you eventually run out of them.
 
 If this is the problem, it has been fixed in the source tree and the fix
 will be avaiable in 1.3b4.

 Hi Marc.
 
 This may indeed be the problem.  When will 1.3b4 be available?  If it's going
 to be awhile, is there any way I can put in the fix myself?
 
 Thanks for your quick response,
  John

 There is no firm date set yet.

 (cut and pasted and patch probably wouldn't like it; easiest to apply
 by hand.  The lines with + in front are ones which are added.)

State-Changed-Why:
In addition, 1.3b7 when released will have much better
CGI support on NT.  I suggest you try it out when it
comes out, and please let us know if you still have that 
problem so we can close this bug report.   If you have a
compilation environment handy, you could pull down a 
snapshot of the Apache tree from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/
and compile it yourself.  Thanks!
