>Description:
If httpd is started with mod_php, it dies when sent SIGHUP

With mod_php uncommented in httpd.conf.
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start
killall -HUP httpd will kill httpd. POOF!
With mod_php commented in httpd.conf
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start
Then killall -HUP httpd will not kill httpd.

There is an interesting workaround:
comment out mod_php, start httpd, then uncomment mod_php, killall -HUP.
PHP will be activated, and SIGHUP doesn't kill httpd now. Weird huh? 

Related issues: 
logrotate on Redhat installations will SIGHUP httpd everytime it rotates the logs- 
which is either weekly, or when the log gets bigger than a certain size. So this may 
explain some of the problems where the httpd dies "randomly".

>Fix:
No but workaround:
comment out mod_php, start httpd, then uncomment mod_php, killall -HUP.
PHP will be activated, and SIGHUP doesn't kill httpd now.
