>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 with Sun WorkShop C compiler version 4.2
>Description:
If I compile Apache with the GNU gcc compiler, everything works properly.
But if I compile with Suns cc compiler, error_log indicates httpd is looking
for icons and cgi scripts in /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/icons and 
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/cgi-bin, instead of /usr/local/etc/httpd/icons
and /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin, respectively.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have experienced this problem on four SPARC boxes.
>Fix:
I suppose you could install the GNU compiler everywhere

 Did you enable any optimization when you compiled it with the sun
 compiler?  Does it work if you disable optimization?
