>Description:
I'm building ApacheJServ-1.0 on HPUX 10.20 and ran into
the following problem that seems to be due to /usr/bin/sh
which is the POSIX.2-conformant command shell.
The problem does not occur if I use /usr/old/bin/sh
which is the "standard" Bourne shell.

Line 839 of configure 
missing_dir=`cd $ac_aux_dir && pwd`
results in
missing_dir=/usr/local/ApacheJServ-1.0/src/scripts/build/unix
/usr/local/ApacheJServ-1.0/src/scripts/build/unix
but should be 
missing_dir=/usr/local/ApacheJServ-1.0/src/scripts/build/unix
This is because cd in the posix sh prints the path.
If I change line 839 to 
missing_dir=`cd $ac_aux_dir > /dev/null 2>&1 && pwd`
the problem is fixed.  Alternatively I could
put /usr/old/bin before /usr/bin in my path to
get the old bourne shell.
>How-To-Repeat:
run configure on hpux 10.20 with /usr/bin in PATH ahead of /usr/old/bin
>Fix:
If I change line 839 of configure to 
missing_dir=`cd $ac_aux_dir > /dev/null 2>&1 && pwd`
