>Description:
Under httpd_1.5.2a-export, REMOTE_GROUP is set to the group AuthGroup that the
REMOTE_USER belongs to. For instance, I have a cgi that requires a user be
in one of a few groups. Depending on the group, I change the access priviledges.
I could easily determine the group under NCSA httpd by looking at the
REMOTE_GROUP variable. Under Apache, I must read in the .htgroups file and
figure out which groups the user belongs to.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
Do what NCSA httpd 1.5.2a did.
