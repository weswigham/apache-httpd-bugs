State-Changed-Why:
Are you still receiving this error?  
Are you staring Apache as a service?  If so, what userid
is the service starting as?
If you are starting from the command line, what userid
are you logged in as?  Are you using any command line 
arguments to start with?

Thanks for using Apache.
