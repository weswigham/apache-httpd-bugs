>Release:        1.3.17 onwards
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP6a + all relevant post-SP6a hotfixes
>Description:
Your documentation on installing the Win32 service under (for this example) 
Windows NT is incorrect.  The below URLs are now out of date with the advent of 
your new .msi package installations, specifically

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/windows.html#inst
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/win_service.html

The first lists information under 'Complete the steps below before you attempt 
to start Apache as a Windows "service"!' where it states that you should select 
certain options from the Start Menu menu for Apache.  These are no longer the 
same as of 1.3.17 through 1.3.19.  Any references to starting and stopping the 
Apache Server service or as a console app via menu options are textually wrong.

The second URL details how to install or uninstall the Apache Server service 
via Start Menu options.  These are no longer there either and users must use 
the instructions lower down on using a console and 'apache -i -n "<name>"' to 
install the service.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install apache 1.3.17 or 1.3.19 and chose the 'All Users' install.  The Start 
Menu does not gain any options for installing or uninstalling the Apache Server 
service for NT or Windows 9x.  While the options are there for stopping, 
starting and restarting the service _once_it_is_installed_ there are no options 
for installing or uninstalling.  These services are also named differently to 
how they are documented.
>Fix:
Either update your documentation to match the installer and its reduction in 
additions of Start Menu options or rebuild your installer to include these 
options for the 'All Users' install.
