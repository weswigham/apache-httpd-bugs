>Description:
I recently saw that mod_proxy didn't cache certain (static) HTML files.
After further investigation, I found out that mod_proxy throws them away
because the bytes sent and the bytes written to disk were different.
(cache_req.written and cache_req.len differ in ap_proxy_cache_tidy)
I then accessed Apache directly on his port, did a proxy request,
saved the result to disk and compared to the temporary file which
mod_proxy creates in the proxy folder. The only difference I found 
was that the temporary cache file contained Windows like returns
(CR+LF, which show up in emacs as ^M), but the file which Apache
returned didn't contain these returns. 

So if the Apache API filters these ^M out, but mod_proxy saves
them to the cache, them the bytes sent and the bytes written to disk
must necessarily differ, so that ap_proxy_cache_tidy will throw away
the cache file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a HTML file e.g. with NotePad, put it in the document space 
of a web server, access it via Apaches mod_proxy and perform an
rgrep search in the /$APACHEROOT$/proxy folder for the URL of the file.
The file should not be present in the cache.

 I might have missed something in your report; but trying with

 I just cannot quite reproduce this. 
 
 However there are since your version 1.3.4 a number of PR's and changes,
 most notably:
 
   *) The proxy cache would store an incorrect content-length in the cached
      file copy after a cache update. That resulted in repeated fetching
      of the original copy instead of using the cached copy.
      [Ernst Kloppenburg <kloppen@isr.uni-stuttgart.de>] PR#2094
 
 as well as a few others.
 
 Could you try with the latest version ? And see if the problem has gone
 away (and tell us if this is the case ?
