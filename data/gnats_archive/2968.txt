>Description:
I found a problem 
when I make apache 1.3.1 with shared library
support on HP-UX  10.20. 
On Makefile  ".so" is definded
as shared library's extensiton 
but a linker recognizes ".sl" extension 
as shared library.

State-Changed-When: Thu Sep 17 07:37:46 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is now fixed for Apache 1.3.2: we now use
.sl instead of .so and SHLIB_PATH instead
of LD_LIBRARY_PATH under the HPUX platforms.
Thanks for your feedback.
