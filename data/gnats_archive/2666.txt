Linux happy 2.0.34 #6 Tue Jul 21 11:28:48 CDT 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
If you use the <Limit Get> directive in 1.3.1, it won't work until you change get to all caps (eg. <Limit GET>) in the 'access.conf' file.  1.3.0 was more tolerant to mixed cases in directives.

Nothing major, but I though people should know.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
In the 'access.conf' file, change all of your <Limit Get> directives to <Limit GET> and everything should be fine.
