>Description:
Greetings,

This is not a bug, but an inquiry.  I have not seen anything
regarding Java servlet support, or even mention of it for apache.  I
was wondering if you are planning on supporting this, or if you know
of anyone working on a module for this.  I know that there are java
modules, but they simply allow java cgi, not stateful servlets.
Thanks in advance, Sean

Yes, there is an Apache/Java integration project at
http://java.apache.org/. This page contains links to
some modules which already provide access to server
side Java (via JSDK and other methods).
