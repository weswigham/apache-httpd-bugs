>Description:
I echo the comments in PR number 6551. Many people who access our web site use a client application to retrieve information from a database. The author of the client application mistakenly included the directory in the host line of the request header, i.e. Host: hostname/cgi

This was a stupid error, but easily missed because it showed no symptoms with Apache or IIS. We recently upgraded our web server, and installed Apache 1.3.19. Suddenly, the client application was broken, and it took us some time to figure out what the problem was. Without going into all the reasons, fixing the client application is not an option. 

Hopefully, as suggested in the response to PR 6551, someone will implement a configuration directive to relax hostname checking. Can I add a plea to do this in a reasonably flexible fashion, so as to allow through the kind of error described here without opening up any serious security hole.
