This ain't a bug report but it says I should use the form for odd
comments in apache/docs/ABOUT_APACHE.
>Description:
I am sure that many people have the same trouble.
Surely it would make more sense if release "1.3.11" was an
EARLIER release than "1.3.9".  People searching archives
and directories would have a better chance.

PS: Thanks several million for Apache!
Kind regards,
Ged Haywood.

Why would that make more sense?  Under what circumstances
is eleven less than nine?

This has been discussed by the developers and the conclusion
was to keep things as they are.  Thanks for your note,
though.
