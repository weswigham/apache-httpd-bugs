Same problem in linux too.
>Description:

ProxyPass is used to map internal servers to our web server that is the only accessible server from outside. The web server is also used to connect to external world, except that authentication is enabled using a password file, so that you need to provide a password to use our web server as a proxy. Now when anyone visits the web pages, it asks them also for the password when connecting the internal servers mapped using ProxyPass. I've tried the NoProxy etc... but in vain.
