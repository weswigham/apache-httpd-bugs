I don't think this problem depends on the environment. Anyway, I've seen it
on Linux 2.0.x, 2.2.x, HP-UX 10.20/9.05 and IRIX 6.x.
>Description:
I run Apache and Squid on the same server, and sometimes clients are 
misconfigured, and tries to use the Apache server as a web-proxy/cache.
The Apache server is _not_ configured to handle this, mod_proxy is 
_not_ compiled in or configured. I prefer to use Squid as a
proxy/cache instead.

When a client tries to fetch a URL through Apache by i.e
"GET http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html HTTP/1.0" the following 
happens:

 * Apache seems to strip the protocol and server from the
   request, and ends up with "/bug_report.html".
 * If this path should happen to exist on my local server the
   client will get this document. I.e when the request ends up
   as "/" it will get our homepage, which is wrong.
 * The client gets an ordinary 404 when our server don't have
   the requested path.

I think Apache should return a '400 Bad Request' when it gets
a request of the form 
"GET http|ftp|gopher:server.name:port/path HTTP/1.0".
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to contact www.uit.no by telnet and do a

  GET http://www.apache.org/ HTTP/1.0  

and 

  GET http://www.apache.org/foo.html HTTP/1.0

I have implemented a custom warning by using a cgi-script. When 
a 404 occurs, and the request starts with http I send out a customized
error message. So you should try this on a regular Apache server which 
do not use mod_proxy.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sat Sep 22 10:01:34 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug.

HTTP/1.1 requires that servers accept requests in the form
http://server/foo for local pages.  It can not simply refuse such requests if the proxy is not enabled.

By default, Apache is configured with a default virtualhost that serves requests for requests to "unknown" virtual servers on the machine.  This is used by many people because there are many names that can be used to refer to a server in some environments, and people often want them all to work.


If you want that default virtual host to give a 404 or other error page, you can certainly configure it to do that.  But if you don't, then Apache simply can't know if "server" does or does not refer to the local machine.  It can try to do a DNS lookup on the name given, but that is a far far bigger DoS in and of itself and isn't sufficient anyway for various reasons.
