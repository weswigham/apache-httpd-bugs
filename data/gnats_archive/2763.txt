>Description:
On the web page where you mention subscribing to the announcements mailing list, why not a mailto tag?
the web browser will supplu a valid email address (especially if it's used for mail too).

For bug reporting, why not ship the necessary form(s) and cgi with apache web
sever so we can report by email and giving you the benefit of completely accurate
information about the server/OS/... it's failing on?

Not all of us are permanently online...

State-Changed-Why:

The announcements list has over 10K subscribers.  We don't
want to make it any easier for spam trollers to subscribe
themselves to the list.  We've a mixed bag of mailtos and
non-mailtos; we should probably review the situation.

As for bundling the bug script: For one thing, doing that
would not keep you in synch with the latest version of it.
For another, if you're offline, how would your report reach
us?  And for a third - the killer - the script needs to
be on the same system as the bug database, since it frobs
it directly.

These are definitely things worthy of some further thought,
so I'm suspending this PR for later consideration.  Thanks
for the note, and for using Apache!

 I really don't see it being practical or overly useful to allow this.  We
 already get a huge number of dupe PRs even though we have a big link to
 the FAQ, known bugs, etc. before you submit one. If people could generate
 them "offline", then they couldn't access that.  We would also loose all
 ability to add such things as necessary to the bug reporting process after
 the fact.
 
 I really don't see it being all that unreasonable to require that 
 someone have access to the web to be able to submit the bug
 report.  If they have to email themself information to a 
 location where they can access the web, so be it.
