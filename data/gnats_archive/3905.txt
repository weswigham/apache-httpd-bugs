>Environment:
IBM AIX 4.2.1.0, gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
Version 1.3.4 of Apache runs fine with clone of new httpd.conf file.
Version 1.3.4 core dumps when a virtual server containing RewriteRule directives is accessed.

httpd.conf info:
  ServerName www-ows.ecu.edu.au
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteMap ows_hosts rnd:/web/dev/vhosts/www-ows/apps/ows_hosts.txt
  RewriteRule ^/?(.*) http://${ows_hosts:dynamic}/$1 [P]

Accessing http://www-ows.ecu.edu.au/ will generate a core dump.
Comment out the RewriteMap & RewriteRule - the server runs fine.

Have another virtual server with same problem, but the rewrite rule is not from the base directory.
It also core dumps upon any access matching that virtual server name.

Mod_rewrite was enabled via ./configure --enable-module=rewrite
Also tried compiling with and without --enable-shared=rewrite

Contents of error_log:
httpd: [Tue Feb 16 17:40:43 1999] [notice] child pid 50650 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Would be -nice- to have a trusted httpd binary pre-compiled (for AIX 4.2.x) with ALL optional modules included ...

 Compiling from src solved the problem, providing modules uncommented in
 src/Configuration did not include DSO module.

 Removed references to dynamic loading / DSO & recompiled from src fixed
 problem.
 (Edith Cowan University also decided to replace the IBM's with Sun's
 running Solaris, which also fixes the problem ;-)
