Linux eclectic 2.0.34 #1 Thu Jun 11 12:56:23 EDT 1998 i586 unknown
gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
In the default httpd.conf file, there is a section which is commented out:

#<Directory /*/public_html>
#    AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
#    Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
#    <Limit GET POST OPTIONS PROPFIND>
#        Order allow,deny
#        Allow from all
#    </Limit>
#    <Limit PUT DELETE PATCH PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK>
#        Order deny,allow
#        Deny from all
#    </Limit>
#</Directory>

the problem is that the "/*/public_html" needs to be "/*/*/public_html" for most sites
(where the userdir directories are /home/user/public_html) ...
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Change "/*/public_html" to "/*/*/public_html", or do either locationmatch or directorymatch
to handle the default /home/user/userdir configuration.
