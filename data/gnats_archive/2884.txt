>Description:
A long running CGI process will not detect that its stdin/stdout have been
closed by the Apache server.  It's not detected because the spawned CGI 
process has inherited handles for the server's side of the pipes used for 
stdout/stderr/stdin. Eg. The CGI prg writes to stdout don't fail because 
its very own process has a handle that is the target of the writes even
if Apache has closed its handles.

This is not usually a big deal for most CGI programs - they usually terminate
on their own quite quickly.  However, for a longer running, high cost computations
(e.g. a search with tons of hits) it is nice to know that nobody is listening 
anymore. Or worse yet, a CGI prog that is broken and spewing output endlessly.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a cgi program that dribbles out output for a very long time.  Point
a browser at it and then interrupt the load (stop, go to another page etc).  
Look at the taskmanager on the Apache server machine and observe the cgi-prog 
still running...
>Fix:
Here's the fix I used.  I don't claim that it's the best way to do it but
it seems to work.  

in src/main/alloc.c ap_bspawn_child function:
   .... (see trailing context to see where to put the following)

    /*
     *  Fix by Mike Sample (msample@opentext.com) to ensure that a read/write
     *  error will occur in the spawned cgi program if the server closes
     *  the its ends of the pipes (e.g. if the http connection is aborted)
     */
    if ((pipe_in && !SetHandleInformation(hPipeInputWrite, HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT, 0)) || 
        (pipe_out && !SetHandleInformation(hPipeOutputRead, HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT, 0)) ||
        (pipe_err && !SetHandleInformation(hPipeErrorRead, HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT, 0))) {
        if(pipe_in) {
	    CloseHandle(hPipeInputRead);
	    CloseHandle(hPipeInputWrite);
	}
	if(pipe_out) {
	    CloseHandle(hPipeOutputRead);
	    CloseHandle(hPipeOutputWrite);
	}
	if(pipe_err) {
	    CloseHandle(hPipeErrorRead);
	    CloseHandle(hPipeErrorWrite);
	}
        return 0;
    }

    (original code - paste the above in before this line in alloc.c)
    /* The script writes stdout to this pipe handle */
    info.hPipeOutputWrite = hPipeOutputWrite;

Mike,

Thanks for the excellent bug report/debug/and fix!

Just to let you know, I searched through the April '98
MSDN CD and it mentions
that SetHandleInformation is not supported on Win95.  I'm
not sure if that is completely right, but better safe 
than sorry.  Therefore, your patch was reworked to use
DuplicateHandle.  The fix has been committed to CVS and
you should be able to get the fix in the next release of
Apache, or in the latest CVS tree.

Again, your patch was much appreciated, and thanks for
using Apache!
