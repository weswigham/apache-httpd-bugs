>Description:
The error page for status 404 that says:

  Not Found
    The requested URL /xxxxx/yyyy was not found on this server.

does not correctly report the (path portion of) the requested URI.
It decodes part of the URI.  It should report the actual URI.

For example, a request to the URI "http://www.apache.org/foundation%2FFAQ.html"
yields the text "The requested URL /foundation/FAQ.html was not found on this 
server."   

Note that that statement actually is untrue:  The relative URI
/foundation/FAQ.html does exist on the server, it's "/foundation%2FFAQ.html"
which does not.

(It seems that the (partial) request URI is being reported using an
already-decoded string, that string is not being re-encoded as it needs to 
be.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to access http://www.apache.org/foundation%2FFAQ.html and note the
(partial) URI in the error page.
>Fix:
URL-encode the already-decoded path portion of the URL before writing it into
the error page (or use the original un-decoded version).

State-Changed-When: Thu Aug 30 00:29:00 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This change was made during the initial check-in of 1.1b0a.
I am hesitant to change it back unless this is breaking
something.  The original behavior was to not escape the
URL.  Please let me know if this is causing any problems,
so that we can make the correct decision about how to
handle this case.

Thank you for using Apache.
