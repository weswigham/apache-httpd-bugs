>Environment:
Linux RH 6.0, Kernel 2.2.5-15smp, egcs-2.91.66
Apache 1.3.17
php-3.0.18 or php-4.0.4pl1
mod-ssl-2.8.0-1.3.17
openssl-0.9.6
>Description:
Apache starts correctly if I activate only PHP OR SSL. With both activated the process just dies, no error messages in any log (error_log, ssl_engine_log).
The main process starts but quits immediately.
It makes no difference if I use PHP3 or PHP4.
PHP support for Oracle 8.0.5 and mysql 3.23.32 is compiled in.

Sorry, but we are only able to support the standard modules
that come with Apache.  Please address you question to
either a PHP or SSL support forum.

Thanks for using Apache!
