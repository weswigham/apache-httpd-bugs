State-Changed-Why:
We are completely unable to help you, since you don't provide
even the most basic information about what your problem is
such as what configuration steps you followed to try to make
things work, what exactly you are trying to make work, what
happens when you try, etc.

You need to start by looking at the docs and the FAQ for how
you are supposed to configure Apache.
