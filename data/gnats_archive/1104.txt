I can't find anything wrong, but who knows?  I tried to put the same information in a <Directory> tag in the access.conf file, but got the same results.
A dump of the .htaccess file follows:
order allow,deny
allow from .montgomerybell.com.
deny from all
AuthUserFile /export/home/www/Authorize/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /export/home/www/Authorize/.htgroup
AuthName MBA Student Access
AuthType Basic
require valid-user
satisfy any

<Limit GET POST>
require user admin
require group development
</Limit>

State-Changed-Why:
First off, don't use "Limit GET POST" unless you really
mean _ONLY_ limit GETs and POSTs.  Leave the Limit container
out entirely if you want to limit all methods.

What does your logfile show for the requests that
you think should be allowed by the allow from?  If
you are using NIS in a particular way or have your
/etc/hosts file setup in a particular way Apache may never
be seeing the domain name.  Oh, if you have hostnamelookups
off it will fail in 1.2 as well.  The access log will give
you a start on seeing why.
