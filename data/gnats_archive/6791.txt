>Description:
To make a long story short, we use getopt() to add support for two
options: -c, which turns compression on, and -C which sets the program
to use (/usr/local/bin/gzip by default). 

With this on, every time a file is closed because its time is expired,
it will be compressed.

Just hacked this on to my rotatelogs and thought someone else might find
it useful. Feel free to modify the patched code in any way you like or
provide it separately from the core release *shrug*
