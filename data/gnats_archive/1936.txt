>Description:
'http://www.apache.org/index.html/' generates wrong anchor!!!

I found this ploblem in CERN-server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just type 'http://www.apache.org/index.html/' in your Web-Browser.
Or make anchor 'http://www.apache.org/index.html/' in some HTML page.
>Fix:
I suggest web-server should Redirect 'http://www.apache.org/index.html/'
to 'http://www.apache.org/index.html'.
Then the problem will be fixed.

State-Changed-When: Thu Mar 12 06:36:08 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
No, it is a deliberate feature to allow for extra
PATH_INFO at the end of a URL.  While it does mean that
if someone does access a path with that extra info then relative
links will be handled differently, that is not really a
"bug".

If someone accesses the wrong URL, you don't expect it to
work, so that is all that is happening here.

 Note that it only does this for certain files, eg. mod_include.
 
 I'm really not sure what to say except don't do broken things...

 Thanks for your reply.
 
 But I disagree what you told.
 
 I made Web Robot, and tested it in Apache server.
 It went into infinite routine, because 'index.html/'
 generate infinite anchors.
 
 ex>
    http://www.apache.org/index.html/
 -> http://www.apache.org/index.html/mirrors/
 -> http://www.apache.org/index.html/mirrors/mirrors/=20
 -> ...
 
 If some html-writer write some anchor trailed by '/'
 and Apache don't say '404 NOT found' or redirect URL=20
 not-trailed by '/', Robot and WebBrowser got wrong URL=20
 always.
 
 CERN and Netscape Enterprise and IIS ans other Webserver
 say '404 NOT FOUND' on that condition. Plz check them.
 
 Thanks 4 reading my bad english, I am not native-speaker.
 
 I'll wait your reply. cya.
