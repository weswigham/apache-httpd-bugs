State-Changed-Why:
Erm... you have given no information to give us even the
remotest reason to think there is any security hole in
Apache.

There certainly could be security holes in how you have
configured Apache or in CGI scripts you run.

Lots of sites run Apache, so I don't find it too suprising that
you can list a few sites that run it.
