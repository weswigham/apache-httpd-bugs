Solaris 2.5.1 / Sun C compiler
>Description:
I've downloaded the 1.2.6 and tried to compile it. Apache was compiled succesful, but logresolve won't compile.
I've tried everything, but it won't do it.
So i downloaded the binary version of 1.2.5 and it won't work either. When I type:
./logresolve access.week access.test

I always get:
Usage: logresolve [-s statfile] [-c] < input > output

Adapting the source and compiling it gives the same compile errors as in (unmodified) 1.2.6.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid I don't understand what you are saying.  What
do you mean it won't compile?  If it won't compile, then
you have to give the errors you get when you try.  It looks
to me like you compiled it just fine but don't understand
how to run it.  Why not try reading the error it is giving
you for the command line format instead of just saying it
doesn't work?

-O2 problem already fixed in source tree, problem with
binary not working is due to user error.

 In 1.2.5 and 6, if you set it to use cc you have to set OPTIM in your
 Configuration file to -O or something.  This has been fixed to work
 properly automatically in later releases.

 Read what it says!  Your syntax isn't right.

 It says use logresolve < input > output
 
 You are using logresolve input output.
 
 They are different.

 Hi,
 
 Thanks about the reply about the compiler.
 
 About the sytax: sorry for the trouble. I'm not very familiar with this
 sytax and interpreted it wrong.
 
 Just one thing:
 
 Whe I lokk at the statistics I got 53 not resolved names.
 
 logresolve Statistics:
 Entries: 5544
     With name   : 1
     Resolves    : 5543
     - Not found : 53
 Cache hits      : 5489
 Cache size      : 54
 Cache buckets   :     IP number * hostname
     3    195.207.1.112 : Host not found
     8    195.207.1.117 : Host not found
    10    195.207.1.119 : Host not found
    13    193.74.240.18 : Host not found
    18    195.207.1.127 : Host not found
    21    195.207.1.130 : Host not found
    23    193.190.148.4 : Host not found
    31    195.207.1.140 : Host not found
    31  137.113.192.101 : Host not found
    33     12.65.160.52 : Host not found
    35      194.7.15.75 : Host not found
    41    195.238.9.111 : Host not found
    44       195.95.4.6 : Host not found
    47      209.1.32.61 : Host not found
 ......
 
 But when I do a nslookup from that same machine to e.g.
 > 209.1.32.61
 Server:  nsip1.coi.be
 Address:  192.168.77.11
 
 Name:    ptest1.inktomi.com
 Address:  209.1.32.61
 
 I got a name. Any idea what the problem is?
 
 Yours thankfully,
 
 Eddy De Clercq
