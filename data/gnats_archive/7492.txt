>Description:
it seems that the current code of Apache assumes RFC2553 section 3.7 (AF_INET6
wildcard socket grabs IPv4 traffic as well) and listens to AF_INET6 wildcard
socket only, by default.

For security reasons and other
reasons, there are a lot of platforms that does not do this.

therefore, if we run apache on those platforms, it will only accept IPv6 connections, not the IPv4 connections.
>How-To-Repeat:
compile and run apache on IPv6-ready OpenBSD, NetBSD or Win2k.
>Fix:
1. listen to AF_INET6 and AF_INET socket by default, if there's no "Listen" directive.
see apache 1.3.x patches at ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/.  use getaddrinfo
with AI_PASSIVE flag and then go through all the addresses returned.

2. have the following two lines in docs/conf/httpd-std.conf.
	Listen 0.0.0.0:80
	Listen [::]:80

State-Changed-Why:
Just committed was a change to add --[enable|disable]-v4-mapped configure option
which defaults to --disable-v4-mapped on freebsd5*|netbsd|openbsd, which will
result in two listen statements in the default config file.

The default ssl config is not automatically generated, so comments were added
to that describing the two necessary Listen directives.
