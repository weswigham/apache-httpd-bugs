MS Win NT 4.0 Servicepack 6a; Apache 1.3.12 version from Oracle iAS 1.0.1 for NT; ApacheModuleAuthDBM.dll from Apache_1_3_14_r2.exe.
Obviously I'm linking a 1.3.14 module with Apache 1.3.12, but I'm not sure if
this is the reason for the problem.


>Description:
Exactly one user can not log on.
I use "dbmmanage.pl -p users add username password group" to add users with plaintext passwords to a dbm file (users.dir and users.pag).
When I examined the users.pag file, I found that the end looks like
"cornelsenblabla:lisa_usersbalderblabla:lisa_usersdiaz"
where "blabla" is the password and "lisa_users" is the group.
dbmmanage.pl has no problem with the file, but AuthDBM will not allow
diaz to log in.
Is there a file-format incompatibility?
