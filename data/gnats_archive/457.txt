Linux 2.0.30, gcc
>Description:
We're running about 10 different virtual servers on an Intel Linux 2.0.30 
machine. Occassionally, one of the root apache processes goes crazy and 
sucks down all available processor cycles; it has to be killed for the system
to continue normal operation. We haven't seen this happen with the child 
processes - it always seem to be the root process. 

This problem started occuring when we added a virtual server with a moderate
to heavy load, so it may be related to using up some limited system resource.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run several web servers on an Intel Linux 2.0.30 and have robots hit them
mercilessly; wait until the system gets unresponsive and check on the web
server processes' CPU usage.

I would guess that some resouce is running out

 Are you invoking httpd multiple times and using Listen?  If so have you
 moved your ScoreBoardFile somewhere different for each server? 
 
 You can get around that last thing (which we never documented until 1.2
 docs) by adding -DHAVE_SHMGET to your EXTRA_CFLAGS in your Configuration
 file and rebuilding.  Give that a try. 
 
 Otherwise the only thing we can ask is to try 1.2b8 (or b9 in a short
 while) as we've fixed many related bugs.
