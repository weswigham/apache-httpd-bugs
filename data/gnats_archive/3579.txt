My name is Tom Dahl. I am President of First Choice Marketing, Inc. You have your information posted on my domain. 
WWW.classictrends.com. We did not place it there and our server ntr.net claims
they did not place it there. I have just kicked off a National program being directed to our site.
It cannot be accessed due to your information being there. I want it off of there immediatley or we will sue you 
for lost revenue.

State-Changed-Why:
Go ahead and sue.

We have nothing to do with whatever your problem is.  Not only
does your domain seem to work just fine to me, but what you
were probably seeing was simply something saying that the
server was running the Apache software.  It is beyond me
why you complain to the vendor when someone misconfigures
something.  If the server was running Windows, would you
threatent to sue Microsoft?

Please talk to your ISP and grow up.  Threatening legal
action without the intent of backing it up is, in some
places, against the law.
