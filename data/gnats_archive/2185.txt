State-Changed-Why:
Could you run "truss", "strace", or some other type of system
call tracking program on it, so we could see where it dies or
becomes unresponsive?  You could also use "gcore" to get a core
file and see where it might be hung.

 Also, are you using NFS for anything on the system?

 I did a 'gcore' on the httpd that remained after 'apachectl restart'.  Then I
 ran gdb on the core file and obtained this backtrace.(gdb) backtrace#0
 0x8018255b in ?? () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
 #1  0x8019904f in ?? () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1

 #4  0x80a8f44 in main ()
 #5  0x805baa7 in _start ()
 
 Here is 'truss1.out' from 'truss -o /tmp/truss1.out -p 3110'
 (3110 was the pid of the master httpd).

 And below is the list of running httpds at the time of restart.  Note that
 process 3123 is not in the list.

 Further investigation revealed that it belongs to 'rotatelogs', which I use
 for all my logging.  Rotatelogs does not install a signal handler for
 SIGTERM--is this the problem?

 Sounds like an obvious question, but if you don't use rotatelogs, does your
 system still hang/die?
