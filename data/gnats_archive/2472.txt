Windows 95 B
>Description:
     My computer is in an office which experiences a lot of power fluctuations 
and interuptions, so it is on a UPS.  I have the software installed to 
automatically shutdown the computer when the battery gets low, but the Apache 
software hangs the shutdown process.

     This leaves the computer thinking it is turned on, so it reboots as soon 
as power is restored.  Since it has to wait for my network login before 
loading the UPS monitor program (and Apache is in my startup group), this can 
repeat multiple times without me being able to stop it.

     I tried using the -Z option to shut down the server, but I kept getting 
the following error message:

[Fri Jun 19 11:11:36 1998] file .\main\http_main.c, line 5392, assertion "cp" failed
>How-To-Repeat:
     All you should have to do is to run the Apache Server on a Windows 95 
machine and then attempt to do a Shutdown without closing Apache first.

     To get the error message with the -Z option, you should be able to add 
almost any text string after the -Z that doesn't include the "_".  It didn't 
work with any text string containing an "_", but it didn't give an error 
message like the other strings.
>Fix:
     The Apache Server should recognize the shutdown request that Windows 95 
sends to all running applications when attempting to shutdown.

     Otherwise, better documentation on the -Z option and how it could be used 
to work around this problem (if I understand what the -Z option is supposed to 
actually do).

      I am now running the 1.3.3 (Win32) version, so I am able to use the
 command line options to SHUTDOWN and RESTART my Apache Web Server.
 However, it still doesn't recognize the request that Windows 95 sends, 
 when it attempts to shut down, requesting that the program shut down.
 This still causes problems when prolonged power outages cause the UPS to
 initiate the Windows 95 shutdown sequence before battery power fails.
