>Description:
libstd++ installs a header file, alloc.h into /usr/include/g++ ... this header file conflicts with the alloc.h header file included into /usr/local/apache/include

This is a problem when the programmer attempts to use the various STL header files along with the Apache header files.  -I/usr/local/apache/include confuses the STL header files, and -idirafter /usr/local/apache/include confuses the apache header files :)
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply compile a C++ program with the following includes:

#include <string>
#include <httpd.h>
>Fix:
I simply renamed Apache's alloc.h to ap_alloc.h, and modified httpd.h to point to the proper header file.  This fixed the problem.

State-Changed-Why:

Apache and its API is currently based on C, and we don't
necessarily support C++ modules or compilations.  I'm
marking this issue as suspended so we can figure out what
to do about the name conflict.
