>Description:
I was trying to install Apache with the MSI package and when using the custome I selected a directory in drive e:, created a new folder and renamed it Apache, selected it and started to install...

The installer crashed and when i looked, the directory wasn't created. I repeated the process but now i created the target directory by hand. That worked ok.
