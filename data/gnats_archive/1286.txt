>Description:
http_log.c contains:

    if (file && (level & APLOG_LEVELMASK) == APLOG_DEBUG) {
	len += ap_snprintf(errstr + len, sizeof(errstr) - len,
		"%s(%d): ", file, line);
    }

This is irritating, as some error messages are duplicated. File and line number should
be logged for all levels.

 No way, what's the sense of logging the file and line number?  I've said
 many times that: 
 
 - the end user does not give one whit what the file:line number is
 - if we can't write descriptive log messages then, well we suck
 - the line number is utterly useless across code changes
 
 Make it an option.  Do not make it a default.  The error log messages are
 cryptic enough already.

 Fair enough, but as it stands you have to patch code to find out which
 instance of an error message is actually occurring. An option to always
 log file/line is fine by me.
 
 Cheers,
