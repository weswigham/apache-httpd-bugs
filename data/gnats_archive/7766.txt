>Release:        1.3.20
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 (Dell Latitude C800 laptop w/256MB RAM, 20GB HD)
>Description:
I previously had 1.3.19 up and running but noticed that 1.3.20 fixed a few bugs I have experienced. I uninstalled 1.3.19 through the control panel (Add/Remove Programs) and attempted to install 1.3.20 (no-src). The installer starts, asks me for my domain, computer info, email, etc.. When I press install I immediatly get a dialog saying that the Installation Wizard was interrupted. I next did an install on the command line msiexec /I name-of-apache.msi /l mylog.log and the results are below.
