>Description:
I want to know the performance of the Apache Web Server 1.3.12 when there are from 10 to 20 connections(cgi POST method, the cgi program will process the HTTP request body and get packets buffered) per second.  Or what's the maximal connections the Web Server can handle simultaniously? 

Thanks a lot!
