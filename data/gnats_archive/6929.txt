>Organization:
>Environment:
Redhat 7.0, glibc-2.2 
>Description:
when compiling mod_rewrite, cannot find ndbm.h with glibc provided by redhat on redhat 7.0
redhat has changed the location fo ndbm.h again from /usr/include/db1/ndbm.h to 
/usr/include/gdbm/ndbm.h

configure assumes that ndbm.h is in /usr/include/db1/ndbm.h on glibc > 2.1 or in /usr/include/ndbm.h otherwise..

>How-To-Repeat:
just compile with mod_rewrite
>Fix:
either symlink /usr/include/db1 to /usr/include/gdbm
or change mod_rewrite.h to say 
#include <gdbm/ndbm.h>
instead of
#include <db1/ndbm.h>
