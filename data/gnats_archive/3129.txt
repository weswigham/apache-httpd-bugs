>Description:
Let .htaccess contain 'XBitHack full'.  This should fix the file modification
dates so they are the last of all the involved files.

Let a proxy(squid 2.0) translate no-cache/reload to If-Modified-Since requests.

Modify a included file.  Shift-reload the including page in netscape.  It will
not be updated.

This of-course affects all programs wanting to use If-Modified-Since to get
new versions of SSIed documents.

Conclution: 'XBitHack full' is not full.  Its partial.  This is either a
documentation feature or a software feature.  I'm partial to calling it a
software feature.

 I don't understand your problem.
 
 You are explicitly telling Apache to tell all clients that the document
 does not change unless the modification time on the single file changes.
 If that doesn't change, then why should the proxy reload it?  Exactly how
 it chooses to behave in this situation (ie. it can either listen to the
 last-modified and use that or ignore it since your client is reloading it)
 is completely up to it.
 
 What is being done wrong?
