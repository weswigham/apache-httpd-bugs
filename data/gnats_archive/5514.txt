>Description:
Username/passwords within a htpasswd file from pre apache 1.2 are not compatible with apache 1.3.x.  I have customers with approx. 80-100 usernames and passwords in their htpasswd files and all of them will have to be recreated by hand, except that we do not have a list of username/passwords within that file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to www.ufaa2.com, username/password is 'Steve Todd'/gundog.  
>Fix:
Create a converter from pre apache 1.2 htpasswd files to apache 1.3 method.

State-Changed-When: Mon Dec 27 10:26:03 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
They are perfectly compatible.  Normally, Apache doesn't
encrypt them itself; your OS's crypt() function does.  If you
change OSes and have a different crypt() function, then...
well... there isn't much we can do about that...

If I were you, I would look very closely at the problem to
ensure that what you think is the problem is actually the
problem and it isn't really something else.

 As I said, it uses your OS's crypt() function.  
 
 You need to figure out what the old crypt() function returned and what the
 new one does and why your OS is doing something different.
