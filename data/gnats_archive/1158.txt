>Description:
The child spawning API needs (at least) two additions:

- process group control on those systems supporting it

- finer control over the actual spawning, something that's at a lower level
  than spawn_child_* because they all build their own pipe()s.  Yet the
  reliable logging code needs to build its own pipe()s to be used by the child.
