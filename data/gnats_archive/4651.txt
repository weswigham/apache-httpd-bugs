Macintosh Blue G3/400 running MOSXS 
>Description:
xserverfatalbug
On Mac OS X
When 32 or more copies of ApacheBench (ab) are pointed at a CGI script on a website running on Apache/Mac OS X Server machine, the kernel will panic, usually within 30-60 seconds, forcing a reboot.
In the test, c't directed 32 copies of ApacheBench at the "test-cgi" script which is in /Local/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/. By default, the script is not executable. You must 'chmod +x test-cgi' for it to work. However, this could probably happen with any script, though tests of that sort were not published.

I actually tested this on my Blue G3/400 running MOSXS and did get a kernel panic. I got essentially the same results whether launching the attack from the same machine that the webserver itself is on, or launching the attack from a linux machine on the same network. Incidentally, I ran this same test again a Red Hat Linux 5.1 (2.0.34 kernel) box, which did not experience any problems during the "attack."

Has info on it

No but it seems to be related to Apache running on MOSX
