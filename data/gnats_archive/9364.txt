>Environment:
Debian GNU/Linux 'potato', using ash as /bin/sh, version 0.3.8-32.
>Description:
Running ./configure with ash as /bin/sh doesn't work - it doesn't finish creating the configure scripts.  It gives a warning about the SEO variable, amongst other things. I figured that, as portable as Apache is, it had to be a problem with ash, so I filed a bug report against it in Debian, and received this response:

>     bytes=`echo -E '\1' | wc -c | awk '{ printf("%s", $1); }'`
>     if [ "x$bytes" != "x3" ]; then
>         echo " + Warning: Your 'echo' command is slightly broken."

This script is not POSIX-compliant.  Please refer to the standard at
www.opengroup.org.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the script above with ash as /bin/sh
>Fix:
Apparently the configure script has some problems.  It used to work ok.
