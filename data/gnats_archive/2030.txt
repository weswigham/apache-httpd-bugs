>Description:
When the client requests a URL that does not exist, and mod_speling cannot
find a single replacement, it lists many possibilities (code 300, multiple
choices). Those include URLs
that, when selected, generate 403 (or other) errors because they are forbidden.
In fact, the read permissions are such that the user that runs the httpd
(nobody) should be unable to see the files.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.123.html

the files ending in .gz have file permissions 400, where the owner is not
the userid of the httpd.

mod_autoindex does this as well - it will list the contents
of a directory regardless of what the actual permissions on
each file are.  This is the "expected" behavior for something
like this; my suggestion would be to separate your "non-public"
files into a separate directory off the web site.

 It's not even the case of permissions on the file system level, but also
 permissions set by Apache. I have various configuration rules that deny
 requests for certain files. While moving them to another directory would be
 good, that doesn't solve the possible problem of the user finding the names
 of hidden directories. Or, in the case of a scripts directory, listing the
 name of every CGI script.
 
 In the end, I think the security concerns could be addressed by adding a
 3-state flag for the module. If the flag is 0, only when a single match is
 discovered is it returned; a 404 is returned otherwise. If the flag is 1,
 only a list of multiple matches are returned (not very usual, but good for
 completeness). If the flag is 2, single and multiple matches are returned,
 depending on what is appropriate.
 
 I recognize that the problem is not terribly serious or risky, and I don't
 mean to burden your time. I have been using and enjoying Apache since
 0.8.x, and I am very grateful for the excellent work the Apache Group has
 done.

 Sure.  Again, that's the semantics of the autoindexer as well, so I don't
 think we're being inconsistant.  
 
 To really determine if a given file "should be shown", you essentially have
 to go through all the request machinery for each file, since a config
 parameter in an htaccess file way at the document root could affect its
 availability.  It could get kinda ugly.... but if you want to submit a
 patch to do this optionally by some config parameter, we'd consider adding
 it.  You could also *possibly* detect if mod_autoindex is compiled in and
 if so follow the IndexIgnore setting, but that could be complicated and
 require exporting of symbols to work correctly with dynamic linking.

 Hmm, interesting - again, do up a patch and we'd consider it.

 No problem, it's just at this point our coding resources have to be applied
 to bug fixing and being "consistant" everywhere we can, so that's the lens
 I was looking at your report with.
