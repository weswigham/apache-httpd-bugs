>Description:
apache 1.3.4 builds fine stand-alone. However, with mod_perl 1.18,
it won't compile.

Everything is fine until below:

Most *.c files were being compiled with the following flags...
(I cut the whole make output for brevity)
gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DSOLARIS2=250 -DMOD_PERL

Here's where it aborts compilation:
===> modules/perl
gcc -I. -I../../include -I../../include/regex -I../../include/.././os/unix -DSOLARIS2=250 -DMOD_PERL  `/usr/local/bin/perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ccopts` -DNO_PERL_DISPATCH   -DNO_PERL_POST_READ_REQUEST -DNO_PERL_TRANS -DNO_PERL_HEADER_PARSER -DNO_PERL_ACCESS -DNO_PERL_AUTHEN -DNO_PERL_AUTHZ -DNO_PERL_TYPE  -DNO_PERL_FIXUP  -DNO_PERL_LOG  -DNO_PERL_INIT -DNO_PERL_CLEANUP -DNO_PERL_RESTART -DNO_PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS -DNO_PERL_SECTIONS -DNO_PERL_METHOD_HANDLERS -DNO_PERL_SSI -DNO_PERL_DIRECTIVE_HANDLERS  -DMOD_PERL_VERSION=\"1.18\"  -I./os/unix -I../../include     -c mod_perl_opmask.c -o mod_perl_opmask.o

I can only trace it to the __attribute__ definition in

This is my first time reporting a bug, so please be gentle...

I RTFM'ed, looked at c.i.w.s.u, searched the bug registry.

If you still have this problem, then please take it to the modperl mailinglist,
see the SUPPORT document in the mod_perl distribution on how to subscribe.

It's not a known problem, and most likely a problem with your configuration,
but I'm sure someone on the list can help you out!
