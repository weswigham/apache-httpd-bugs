>Description:
Apache leaves occational tmp files in the cache area root which are never removed 
from the system.  These are a result of a client breaking the connection during 
the transfer of a document from an external host.  The document is partially
transfered.  When the client breaks the connection, the transfer quits, but
apache never unlinks the file.

This can be resolved temporarily by having a cron job remove all files of the form
tmpXXXXX from the root of the cache directory.

It does appear that cacheclean eventually will remove these files.

>How-To-Repeat:
Initiate a transfer using client browser (I'm using netscape 4.0).  During the
transfer, hit the stop button (transfer is incomplete).  The temporary file is
created but incomplete.  The rename to the Cache is not completed (this is good).  
The unlink is not executed.
