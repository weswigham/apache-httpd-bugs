The presence or absence of suexec had no effect on whether user .cgi programs would run, nor did the specified owner in suexec.h make any difference.

I'll figure it out myself, but just thought the report might interest you.  Maybe I missed something about what suexec is supposed to do.

Run Apache with cgi enabled by the various items in the .conf files, but without suexec being present.

?? I don't know, maybe Apache is supposed to work this way!

State-Changed-Why:
If suexec isn't enabled, then of course CGIs in
user directories don't run as the user.

If it is enabled, they do.  If you think you have it
enabled and they aren't, then you probably haven't
configured it correctly.  Review the docs.

 suexec sets things up so that CGIs run as a different user than what the
 web server runs as.  This is done through either virtualhosts with user
 and group directives or through ~userdir requests.
 
 Without suexec, the normal way to do things is that all CGIs are executed
 by the user the web server runs as.  This is perfectly acceptable in many
 environments and is not necessarily a security risk.  If people want
 ~userdir CGIs to run as the user instead, they have to use suexec.  If
 they don't, they don't run suexec and CGIs run as they always have on
 nearly every Unix web server in the history of the web.

 Thank you very much for your reply!

   Something new every day..... I always thought that cgi was permissible
 only from ServerRoot until suexec came along.  I always used suexec here,
 so never noticed, especially since the only ISP I ever used announced once
 that cgi was available in userdirs as if it were a new thing.  That's what
 led me to installing Apache on local machines in the first place (I had no
 servers before that).
   NOW it's all clear.
 
 Sigh.  Again, sorry to trouble you.
