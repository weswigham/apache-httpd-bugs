>Environment:
Solaris 2.8 - Apache 1.3.20 BINARY distribution
>Description:
I've recently downloaded the BINARY distribution of apache_1.3.20 from
http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/solaris/apache_1.3.20-sun4u-sun-solaris2.280.tar.gz

After complete installation and proper configuration, I was getting garbled text when trying to view the default test page (eg. http://www.example.com/ ) with my Windows IE-5 browser which is set to "en-us" for a default language.  After much troubleshooting, I noticed that the AddLanguage line for the "zh" language had been left out of the httpd.conf that comes with the dist.  With this line missing, apache was serving the "index.html.zh.Big5" file even though my browser is asking for English. (which should result in "index.html.en" being served)
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the binary dist for Solaris at:
http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/solaris/apache_1.3.20-sun4u-sun-solaris2.280.tar.gz

And view the default page from an IE5 browser.
>Fix:
Add the line:

AddLanguage zh .zh

to httpd.conf and restart.  Nice and simple.

State-Changed-Why:

This bug is fixed in Apache 2.0.24.  A backport to the 1.3
tree is possible, but nobody has stepped up.

This bug was interrelated to several mod_negotiation and
mod_autoindex side effects, all of which are cleared in
the upcoming 2.0.24 alpha (beta?), and will be in the
offical general release of Apache 2.0, whenever that is
announced.
