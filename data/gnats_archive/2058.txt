>Description:
When you specify a wildcard virtual host like <VirtualHost *:8080> the error:
'Failed to resolve server name for 0.0.0.0 (check DNS)' is reported, and the
hostname is set to 'bogus_host_without_reverse_dns:8080'

This is non critical, but is annoying as it isn't an error, INADDR_ANY isn't 
supposed to resolve to anything useful. The hostname should really stay 
as '*', but more importantly there shouldn't be an error.
>How-To-Repeat:
<VirtualHost *:8080>
</VirtualHost>
>Fix:
I have a simple patch I will paste below. If you have trouble with it, I can 
mail it to you. There may be a better place for this check but this works for 
me.
