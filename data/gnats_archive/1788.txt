>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
i noticed several other PRs with similar symptoms, and all the fixes said
to read the docs.  i read the docs and i believe i am doing this right.
perhaps the docs could cover this case more explicitly since i am obviously
not the only one having trouble with it

State-Changed-Why:

The vhosts docs note several times that the
first name-based vhosts has the highest priority
and is always used if there is no other vhosts
(which is the case in your configuration)
If you use the ip address of your main server for
name-based vhosts the main server won't be used
to serve any pages.

You can either create a "_default_" vhost as your
"main server" (see the example-page for details)
which is the recommended method or you can add
the following 'dummy' vhost as the first
vhost section in your configuration:

 <VirtualHost ip.of.your.mainserver>
 ServerName your.main.servers.hostname
 </VirtualHost>
