>Environment:
SunOS  5.5.1 Generic_103640-08 sun4u sparc
(gcc)
>Description:
Using vanilla Apache 1.2.4, basic auth, set up .htaccess file for a 
cgi script that uses the POST method. create a form to point to that script
and pass some data. start up msie 4.0 under win95 (don't know
about other platforms), load the form, then submit the data. You are now looking
at the browser dialog box. check the access log for the server: a POST with no
user name, all ok. fill in the dialog box with a legitimate user and send it.
Now check the log: a pile of post data tacked on to the beginning of the
second POST request. No user name. but 200 ok... 

Here's an example of the POST that's sent:

POST /cgi-bin/test/ariel-test/test-cgi HTTP/1.1^M
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*^M
Referer: http://xxx.columbia.edu/~ariel/test/msie.html^M
Accept-Language: en-za^M
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded^M
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate^M
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.0; Windows 95)^M
Host: xxx.columbia.edu^M
Content-Length: 359^M
Connection: Keep-Alive^M
^M
blot1=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+1&blot2=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+2&blot3=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+3&blot4=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+4&blot5=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+5&blot6=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+6

that's all one packet btw.
the server reply looks like:

HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required^M
Date: Tue, 11 Nov 1997 20:09:13 GMT^M
Server: Apache/1.2.4^M
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="msie 4.0 test"^M
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100^M
Connection: Keep-Alive^M
Transfer-Encoding: chunked^M
Content-Type: text/html^M
^M
334^M
<head><title>Access Denied</title></head>
etc...

the second POST ought to look like the first one  but with the auth data. 
instead it has some duplicate headers. in any case:

POST /cgi-bin/test/ariel-test/test-cgi HTTP/1.1^M
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*^M
Referer: http://xxx.columbia.edu/~ariel/test/msie.html^M

that was also one packet.

the log entries:
dynamic-60-101.cc.columbia.edu - - [11/Nov/1997:15:53:32 -0500] "(POST /cgi-bin/test/ariel-test/test-cgi HTTP/1.1)" 401 832 "(ref http://xxx.columbia.edu/~ariel/test/msie.html)"
dynamic-60-101.cc.columbia.edu - - [11/Nov/1997:15:53:40 -0500] "(blot1=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+1&blot2=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+2&blot3=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+3&blot4=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+4&blot5=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+5&blot6=this+is+a+test+of+the+emergency+broadcasting+cookie+6POST /cgi-bin/test/ariel-test/test-cgi HTTP/1.1)" 200 1208 "(ref http://xxx.columbia.edu/~ariel/test/msie.html, http://xxx.columbia.edu/~ariel/test/msie.html)"

and btw the server sends a good response; you get your script output, and the next 
time you access the script you aren't asked for login, which means that the 
auth did work, in spite of the log.

Occasionally we see the POST data getting tacked on to a request after the second 
POST; the script which originally brought the bug to my attention puts
out a page with inline images, and one of those GETs gets clobbered:
dialup-5-14.cc.columbia.edu - - [01/Nov/1997:12:04:18 -0500] "(POST /sec-cgi-bin/mad/ccs/madsearch HTTP/1.1)" 401 362 "(ref https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/ccs/recruiting/)"
dialup-5-14.cc.columbia.edu - cpw10 [01/Nov/1997:12:04:24 -0500] "(POST /sec-cgi-bin/mad/ccs/madsearch HTTP/1.1)" 200 6864 "(ref https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/ccs/recruiting/, https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/ccs/recruiting/)"
dialup-5-14.cc.columbia.edu - - [01/Nov/1997:12:04:27 -0500] "(DATABASE=%2Fwwws%2Fdata%2Fcu%2Fccs%2Frecruiting%2Fdata%2Flogin&REPORT=%2Fwwws%2Fdata%2Fcu%2Fccs%2Frecruiting%2Freports%2Fmenu&ReportCompression=TrueGET /sec/cu/ccs/graphics/slab2.jpg HTTP/1.1)" 501 340 "(ref https://www1.columbia.edu/sec-cgi-bin/mad/ccs/madsearch)"
and here the GET actually fails.


>How-To-Repeat:
I have a url but you won't have access to the logs. 
It only takes 5 minutes to set up your own test case though.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the detailed and useful report.  This appears to be due
to a problem with Apache not doing one of:

   - eating the body of the request
   - or closing the connection after such a response where
     there could be a body the we haven't read

We will look into how we want to fix it.

 Hi, any chance you could give this patch a try?  It should apply cleanly
 against 1.2.4 or 1.2.5.  I'm not sure if anyone ever forwarded the patch
 to you.

Thanks a bunch for testing the patch, glad it worked.  It should

The patch in this PR is not sufficient.  A complete fix will
