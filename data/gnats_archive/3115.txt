Solaris 2.6
uname output: SunOS lsc 5.5.1 Generic_103640-18 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
In my srm.conf, I have listed several DirectoryIndex files:

	DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.shtml index.cgi

I also have mod_speling enabled in my server, with the "CheckSpelling on" in httpd.conf.

If one of those files exists in a directory (e.g., http://my.web.server/yow/index.htm), and 
there are no other files in that directory, and I explicitly try to browse one of the other 
DirectoryIndex files (e.g., http://my.web.server/yow/index.shtml),
mod_speling will notice this and attempt to redirect me to the right page.

However, even though there is only one choice of file to go to, mod_spelling returns
the "Multiple Choices" page, and only lists the single file (index.htm) as an
alternative.  It cites "(common basename)" as the reason for choosing it.

But note that if I try to browse to /yow/index.html, mod_speling redirects me 
automatically to index.htm (presumably because it's only a one letter difference).

But even so, isn't mod_speling supposed to send a Location: header back if there 
is only one choice of files to redirect to?
>How-To-Repeat:
I have made a sample URL for you to see this behavior on -- it contains the example
file that I mentioned above (index.htm).  But if you try to browse to index.shtml,
you'll see the indicated behavior.

Notice that http://www.lsc.nd.edu/apache_test/index.html does the right thing 
(redirects via Location: to index.htm)

State-Changed-By: rbbloom@us.ibm.com
State-Changed-When: Wed Oct  7 12:04:40 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is working as expected and documented.  Mod_speling

"allows up to one misspelling (character insertion / 
omission / transposition or wrong character)" 

if it finds more than one file or the only file it finds has
more than one spelling mistake, the module will create a file
list for the user to select the correct file from.
