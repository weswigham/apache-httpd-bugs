State-Changed-Why:
I'm sorry but I don't understand your request.

1. Have you looked in the FAQ or not?  (If not,
   it's at <http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html>)
2. You say the proxy module is not working.  What is
   it not doing that you think it should be?  Or
   what is it doing that you think it should NOT be?

We need more detailed information; please feel free
to say it in several different ways if you're not sure
about the correct English.
