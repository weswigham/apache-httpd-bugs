>Description:
apachectl does not accomodate for a config file named other than httpd.conf -- also, if the config file exists in any directory other than /usr/local/apache/conf, it does not find it. (Did I miss something in my install?) 

In my case, I am running multiple apache servers on one physical server, and hence have multiple config files on one server.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Below is the modification I madeto the apachectl file (I included the CONF variable in the configuration section, and modified the rest of the script to take into account the conf file location )

 There is a reason it says "including options if necessary".   If you
 want it to use a different config file, point it there.  If you want
 it to use a different documentroot on the command line, point it there.
 etc.
 
 There are a lot of things other than -f httpd.conf that someone could want
 to set, so instead of creating options for all of them the HTTPD 
 variable is there to set.
