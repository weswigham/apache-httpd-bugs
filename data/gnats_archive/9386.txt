>Description:
I have configured a mod_rewrite ruleset to handle mass virtualhosts (mod_mass_vhost wasn't flexible enough). My ruleset is straightforward:

    RewriteMap  lowercase   int:tolower
    RewriteMap  vhost       dbm:/conf/vhosts_db
    RewriteCond   ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}|NONE}  ^(.+)$
    RewriteCond   ${vhost:%1}  ^(/.*)$
    RewriteRule   ^/(.*)$   %1/$1 [L,PT]

However, if the server needs to return a 403 or 404 (and likely other error conditions in which a path to the offending file is displayed), I get the following error:

The requested URL /htdocs/users/username/nonexistant/path was not found on this server.

If I change the RewriteRule to:

RewriteRule   ^/(.*)$   %1/$1 [L]

I get:

The requested URL /nonexistant/path was not found on this server.

I do realize that this is the result of the PT flag doing what it was designed to do, but didn't know whether this particular condition was known or not.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
*shrug* Error condition shouldn't, IMO, return the absolute path to a file. The handling which is seen sans 'PT' is correct.
