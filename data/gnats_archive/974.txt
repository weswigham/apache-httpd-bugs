State-Changed-Why:

mod_proxy doesn't know anything about firewalls.
If a RemoteProxy is set it always forwards requests to that proxy
unless the upstream proxy is not reachable.

Does the problem occour only with specific URLs?
Can you verify if the remote proxy (your firewall machine)
was indeed accessible from the apache proxy when the
failure occurs? Are there any timeout or other related
messages in the error log?

State-Changed-Why:

A patch (similar to the one you suggested)
has been committed to the current 1.3 source tree.

Errorlog shows [because of the firewall/remote Proxy]:
>>[Fri Aug  1 16:52:11 1997] connect: Network is unreachable


A trace of the local network traffic [snoop] shows, that the apache server
wants to connect to the requested host **directly** and not via the remote
proxy (firewall). The requested URLs can be accessed [?], after killing and
restarting the httpd.

Could this problem related to #PR510?

One word to our configuration - it looks like:
>ProxyRequests On
>ProxyDomain     .rexroth.de
>NoProxy         [some full qualified intranet ip-adresses, no netmasks]
>NoProxy         .rexroth.de
>NoProxy         mpoint.mannesmann.de
# Firewall
>ProxyRemote     *  http://proxy1.mannesmann.de:8080

Full DNS name resolution is on the apache server available.
