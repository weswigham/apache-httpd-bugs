>Description:
We're running an older Netscape Web Server for http://www.greyhound.com

We have a large imagemap that works fine when you access the page directly
or via a CERN 3.0 Proxy server.

However, when we access the page through the Apache 1.2.1 Proxy, the request
infinately hangs until it times out.

Our web server is getting the request, and from what I can tell, attempting
to return documents, but they're never received, or logged, with the Apache
proxy.

I do NOT have this problem with other (Apache) Web Servers. That's what's so
strange!
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, go through an Apache 1.2.1 Proxy to the url http://www.greyhound.com
and try to use the Imagemap.
Hard links are at the bottom of the page to verify the documents exist.
>Fix:
Both the CERN and Apache proxies issue similar HTTP requests, that appear to be
correct.
It's my opinion that the problem lies in the way the Apache proxy handles the
returned documents from this Older Web Server

State-Changed-Why:
Your server is broken.  If you telnet to port 80
and do a:

GET /graphics/ghfolders.map?224,52 HTTP/1.0


(empty line after the GET line), it sends a response
and then hangs; it does not close the TCP connection.  This
can be seen as nothing but a bug in the server.  Some
clients may work around it by closing the connection
themself once they get a particular number of bytes,
but for various reasons that is messy in Apache and
should be unnecessary.

Contact Netscape to see if they have a fix.
