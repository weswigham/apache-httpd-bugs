Hi!

This is a small design bug, which should be IMO fixed.

When using several chained authentification modules in apache, you can pass
a failed authentification to the next auth-module in chain (e.g. by
configuring AuthAuthoritative Off [mod_auth.c]).

If the auth request is passing the last module (without being authentificated),
you will get an internal server error (the auth. request is passes into
nirwana). You have to close the browser to make this error go away
(to enforce a new authentification).

>How-To-Repeat:
use on or more Auth-Modules, configured to pass the authent. to the next module
in chain e.g. with Configs like "AuthAuthoritative Off"
>Fix:
There should be a small and simple module "mod_auth_fail.c" installed als last
module in the auth. chain to prevent an error 500. If all auth modules
are passing the auth-request to the next in chain, this modules
enforces a negative authentification at the end of the auth chain.

This could also be done by proper (re-)configuration of all .htaccess files on
the server - but in our case we had to rearrange the order of our
auth. modules. So we hit this design bug.
