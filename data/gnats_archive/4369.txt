>Description:
I would like to be able to specify a class path for a zone.

I am running many virtual servers from my apache server and 
would like only certain jar files to be visible to certain zones.

I understand this may be difficult since you generally have to 
specify teh classpath before you run java. but it would
be a neat feature.

 Please do not file bug reports for things that are not bugs.
 
 The repositories= line in the zone.properties file will work as a classpath.
