>Description:
I have read all you documentation that comes with the server on setting up both Name and IP based Virtual Servers.  I Have configured the httpd.conf many times with the same result.  When trying to access the http addr of the Virtuals I keep getting the default server.  I have set the ServerPath, ServerName, NameVirtualHost and the VirtualHost settings -  Actual site location www.jaxwebs.net and www.g2ginc.com.  Both have Cnames and active DNS.  I even deleted all the DNS info and reconfigured with the same result.

This is serious because I am a beginning my own hosting and I have 20 Sites that I need to setup asap.

Thanks

David Hairston
