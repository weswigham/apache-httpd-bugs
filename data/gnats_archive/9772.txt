>Description:
Browser displays source code instead of rendering it.  This error logged:

[Fri Feb  8 12:01:55 2002] [warn] proxy: Ignoring duplicate HTTP header returned
 by http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn (GET)

The problem began after upgrade to apache 1.3.23.  It does not exist at 1.3.6

This does not appear to be the same problem as reported in 8724, nor does the
page appear to have any duplicate HTTP header in it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using apache as your proxy, point your browser to:

http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn

Or select "Sign in" from page at www.ebay.com
>Fix:
no, not yet.

State-Changed-Why:
From submitter:

No, this patch did not fix the problem.
Point a browser to the following url thru apache proxy to see the mess.

  http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn

The browser still displays page source instead of rendering, and these
two lines are logged in the error log (yes one url, two errors logged).

[Wed Feb 13 09:19:20 2002] [warn] proxy: Ignoring duplicate HTTP header returned by http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn (GET)

As before, the page does fine via apache proxy 1.3.6.
