>Description:
Some people don't like Apache's HTTP compliant behaviour to obey multiple file extensions, e.g. if there's a handler for .php a file with an extension like .php.bak is parsed by this handler. It would be great if there was an Apache feature to let Apache only pay attention on the file's last extension. With a complicated set of FilesMatch and ForceType/ForceHandler directives we can get a similar behaviour but it'd be better to just introduce a new directive for usual contexts (needed for Directory and Location e.g.).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think best would be an own directive for this.
