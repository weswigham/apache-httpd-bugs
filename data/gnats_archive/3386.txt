With this configuration we experience serious perfomance problems.
Each process seems to use more and more memory (peak value today: 480MB) until all of the system
memory (512 MB) is used and the system starts to swap continously, ruining the overall perfomance.
Could this be a mySQL-related problem, e.g. infinite loops or something like that ?!
We searched several mailing lists but no-one seems to have this problem, as nearly all memory leak-
problems are related to the rewrite-mod, which we are appearantly not using. 
If there is someone having a solution, he should mail us as fast as possible.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, but encountering our poor perfomance would surly not help.
>Fix:
None at all.
