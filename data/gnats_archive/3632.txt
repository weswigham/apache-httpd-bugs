$ uname -a
OSF1 ultrix1 V4.0 878 alpha
$ gcc -v

>Description:
Some regular expressions don't work at OSF/1 (Solaris, Reliant, AIX, HP-UX, IRIX
are ok).
Compiling re in src/regex and doing ./re < tests showed:
$ ./re < tests 
314: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
318: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
319: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
320: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
344: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
345: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
384: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
419: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'

>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, I'm behind a Firewall... Try "./re < tests"
>Fix:
Working on it... But hints are welcome

 Hi there.
 
 Further explanation:
 
 ScriptAliasMatch ^/cgi-bin/.+\.admin(.*)	<ABSOLUTE_PATH>$1
 
 works for me (means: it matches things like
 "http://<servername>/cgi-bin/ecki.admin...", where
 
 ScriptAliasMatch ^/cgi-bin/.+\.storefront(.*)	<ABSOLUTE_PATH>$1
 
 doesn't (means: apache is looking for
 <DocumentRoot>/cgi-bin/<something>.storefront(...) and correctly
 logging an error because it isn't found). Cutting the first three
 characters from the pattern (^/c) made it work, but I don't like
 the solution.
 
 The error with $APACHE_SRC/src/regex/re comes from engine.c, at
 least I tracked it back to function fast(), but seems to be caused
 by an incorrect compiled expression. Is there any description of
 the expression compiler except *.c?
 
 I'd like to investigate further if one could send me some useful
 hints.
 
 Eckard
