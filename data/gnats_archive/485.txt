>Description:
We need our server to listen to multiple ports (eg. 80-85). Some of our
CGI scripts need to know which port was used to invoke them, and the server
reports the first one (80) no matter which one was used.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can see this even with your (included) script:

http://www.bktv.com:80/cgi-bin/test-cgi ... reports SERVER_PORT=80 (correct)
http://www.bktv.com:81/cgi-bin/test-cgi ... reports SERVER_PORT=80 (incorrect)
http://www.bktv.com:82/cgi-bin/test-cgi ... reports SERVER_PORT=80 (incorrect)
http://www.bktv.com:83/cgi-bin/test-cgi ... reports SERVER_PORT=80 (incorrect)
http://www.bktv.com:84/cgi-bin/test-cgi ... reports SERVER_PORT=80 (incorrect)
http://www.bktv.com:85/cgi-bin/test-cgi ... reports SERVER_PORT=80 (incorrect)
>Fix:
Make whatever module responsible for this report the correct SERVER_PORT used.%0

State-Changed-Why:
This is covered by PR#459.  To which I responded:

This is the expected behaviour actually.  Each server has
exactly one ServerName and one Port.  The Listen directive
tells apache which sockets to listen on, but doesn't tell
it what the main server's (or any other server's) Port setting
is.  Consider the case of multiple Listens, each intended
for a different virtual host.

You'll have to set Port in the main server config.  If you
have a need to serve the same config on multiple ports and
have SERVER_PORT set for each port
you will have to use multiple VirtualHosts.

Thanks for using Apache.
