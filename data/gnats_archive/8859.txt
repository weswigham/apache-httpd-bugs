>Description:
The rewritelock file of mod_rewrite, i.e. the file defined with the 'RewriteLock' directive does get deleted during a webserver restart, i.e. by issuing 'apachectl restart'. This leaves any server depending on the lock file in a not working state.
Further inconsistencies may happen as the deleted lock file my still be opened by other web server processes.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
Do not delete the rewrite lock file during web server restarts.

 Hint:
 This can be race condition where the lock file is deleted by rewritelock_remove
 of the old server instance after being created by the new server instance. The
 problem usually happens at log rotate time of a test system with the HD in
 standby mode at execution start and the webserver otherwise idle.
 As the lock file deletion problem is only reproducible from time to time this
 too points to a race condition.
 
 A simple fix could be to prevent lock file deletion in mod_rewrite.c, function
 rewritelock_remove(). At least this is what I will try.
