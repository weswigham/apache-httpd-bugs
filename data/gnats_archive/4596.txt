SunOS picard 5.6 Generic_105181-14 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10 gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
Porting over to Apache 1.3.4, the htmls and cgis are properly displayed but no user authentication mechanism is provided.

In my httpd.conf file:
<VirtualHost 123.456.78.9:81>
DocumentRoot  /opt/netra
AccessFileName  .htaccess
...
<Directory /opt/netra>
Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride Limit
Order deny,allow
Allow from .cc21.com.sg
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

In /opt/netra/.htaccess:
        AuthUserFile /etc/opt/netra/SUNWnetra/.htpasswd
        AuthGroupFile /dev/null
        AuthName "Administrative Access"
        AuthType Basic

<Limit GET POST PUT DELETE>
                order deny,allow
                deny from all
                allow from all
                require user setup
</Limit>

But when i point to the url, i get an Internal Server Error. And in the error log file, i get:
/opt/netra/.htaccess: AuthUserFile not allowed here
I have to remove all Auth* directives to get the htmls displayed. Then, of course, it is as good as removing the .htaccess!

Also can a subdirectory (e.g /opt/netra/xxx/yyy) be UNprotected (no user authentication)? If yes, how?

Thanks.

G.

State-Changed-Why:
You set "AllowOverride Limit" then expect other directives
to work.  Check the AllowOverride docs for what you have to
set to allow various things to work.
