>Environment:
qnx4.23, watcom 10
>Description:
under 1.2b2, a cgi file (with arguments) could be invoked as:

http://www.rtquotes.com/cgi/htc?MNH

this would be passed to the htc process with argv (as well as the env var 
QUERY_STRING) set to 'MNH'. Under 1.2b6 it results in a 500 error, and the 
cgi file is never invoked. the error log says 'access to /web/cgi/htc failed 
for 206.79.208.129, reason: Premature end of script headers'
>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot put both servers up for testing, but I'm available for debugging.

Sorry, can't duplicate it.  Are you using suexec?
Can you send a copy of a minimal script which exhibits
this behavior?

Requested information about how to reproduce not given;
if this is still an issue with 1.2b9, please open another
PR with all the information needed so we can reproduce
it on _our_ servers, not just a link that shows it 
happening on yours.
