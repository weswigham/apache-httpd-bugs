>Unformatted:

Our Apache (1.1.3) is also logging two entries for one hit.  I have
verified that the server is only getting one hit by telneting into port
80 and sending "GET /~ABCDEFGH HTTP/1.0 "<cr><lf>.  Sure enough, it logs
it twice in the log file.  I'm looking through the configuration files
currently to see if there is a reason for this (somewhere in
httpd.conf), but I can't figure it out.

	Anyway, the person who responded to this problem report was probably
mistaken, though our server only logs two entries per hit, not 400.  It
does log both of them at the same time, and sometimes (though usually
not) only logs one.

> >Description:
> Three times since upgrading to 1.2b8 (three weeks) a single hit has logged multiple entries to my access logs.
> In a few cases, it has logged over 400 hits, over a span of 15 to 20 minutes.
> The additional entries are sometimes a second or two apart, sometimes multiple entries in the same second.
> There are other accesses taking place in between the times of the multple entries, these accesses are logged correctly.
> I have not been lucky enough to be at the server when these episodes have taken place.
> The remote machine has always been using Netscape 1.22 (coincidence?).
> I am using mod_log_config, with the following settings in httpd.conf:
> TransferLog logs/access_log
> LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\""
>  
> >How-To-Repeat:
> I have unable to reproduce this. The only thing I found in common is the USER_AGENT = Mozilla/1.22
> >Fix:
> No. I grep -v the excess lines out of the log file and restart the server.
> I have not completely ruled out the possibility that the remote machine may be hitting me hundreds of times due to something at their end, but I never encountered this before.
