>Description:
When attepting to log hits, the system does not log the userid and pass in
the ref information if it came in with a :

http://user:pass@site/page/

format.  
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Create $APACHEROOT/htdocs/protected
2) Put the following .htaccess
AuthUserFile $APACHEROOT/protected/.htpasswd
AuthName "TEST"
AuthType Basic
<Limit GET>
require valid-user
</Limit>
3) Add an id/pass to the file
4) Put in your httpd.conf 
<Directory $APACHEROOT/protected>
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
DirectoryIndex index.cgi index.html index.shtml
AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit
Options +ExecCGI
</Directory>
5) Make sure CustomLog is set to "combined", or uncomment the CustomLog for
referer
6) Copy $APACHEROOT/cgi-bin/printenv $APACHEROOT/htdocs/protected/index.cgi
7) Add to the bottom of the index.cgi

print "\<A HREF\=\"/protected/index2.cgi\"\>TEST\<\/A\>";

8) Access it at http://userid:pass@site/protected

It only logs as :

heimdall.ttsg.com - ttsg [12/Feb/2000:13:28:19 -0500] "GET /protected/ HTTP/1.0" 200 1157 "-" "Mozilla/4.6 [en] (X11; I; BSD/OS 4.0.1 i386; Nav)"

State-Changed-When: Wed May  3 13:13:21 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
According to RFC 1738, section 3.3, usernames and passwords
are NOT ALLOWED in http-schemed URLs.  So even if some
browsers and servers support this, it is technically
illegal and Apache is perfectly correct in ignoring
the auth information passed thusly.
