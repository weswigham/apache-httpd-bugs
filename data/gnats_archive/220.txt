patchlevel unknown
Compiler : gcc
>Description:
There seems to be a problem between the command : FancyDirectory on
and the module : mod_trailer.c

Any attempt to view a directory where a trailer has been defined 
causes httpd to crash with a SIGSEV message.
>How-To-Repeat:
- Use the module 'mod_trailer.c' from the 'support' section
- Set FancyDirectory on
- Define a trailer for documents in one directory
- Open the directory with a browser.
- Core dump
>Fix:
Not yet - I contacted the author of the module so far....
Maybe the problem could be solved if the filename in the url
was checked and the trailer added only for '.html' documents

State-Changed-Why:
Since this only happens in combination with a module that
isn't part of the Apache distribution, there's not much
we can do about it.  It definitely appears to be a problem
with the module code.  If you can show otherwise, please
*do* let us know.  Thank you for using Apache!
