I imagine that anyone building this under IRIX will see the problem.  It builds
fine on my intel linux (redhat 6.0, I think) box.

Nope; I looked at the include files and under casual inspection didn't see 
anything wrong.  I am continuing to poke at it and will post anything I 
discover.

 Does it work if you rename the sa_len variable to something else? e.g.
 salen. The identifier sa_len may be defined as a macro by the system headers.

 That appears to be it!  renamed it to apr_sa_len and the compile went
 fine.  Thanks!

 Ah, chad, brings a tear to my eye.  Literally.  We used punchcard chad
 for confetti at highschool football games, until someone got a bit of it
 in the eye and ended up with a laceration.  :-(
 
 Unsurprisingly, its next appearence in my life is no more positive an
 experience... :-)
 
   best regards,
