>Environment:
Client: Windows 2000, Internet Explorer 5.5
Server: FreeBSD 4.2, Apache 1.3.17
>Description:
Internet explorer for Win32 platforms does not seem to completely and correctly provide support for the Vary: header, returned in the HTTP/1.1 reply from Apache Web Server.

When it recieves a "Vary: Host" header in the reply, it seems to automatically mark the item as uncacheable, not just mark it as uncacheable for other hosts.

There is already a workaround for this issue (via the force-no-vary variable), but it also imlies a force-response-1.0, which is quite a nasty compromise to have to come to grips with.

This problem has typically raised it's head in the situation where we are using mod_rewrite to accomplish mass virtual hosting.
Typically if the HTTP/1.1 browser gets a request for a different "Host" it will not use the cashed copy it has anyhow, and this is proven in the case of the native apache virtual-hosts, in that they do not output a "Host" header, yet work quite well.
This may be why the Internet Explorer browser has not implemented the Vary: Host support, (ie: it is ludicrous to suggest that a brower *will* use a cached copy of another host's pages...)

I realize that mod rewrite may be doing everything correct by-the-book, but it still sits hard on the old conscience that 80% of the worlds browsers are not caching your pages properly, causing additional bandwidth, and stopping your pages from looking responsive (especially mouse-overs).

It had been suggested previously that we could perhaps set a "[NV=variable]" flag in the optional flags section of the RewriteCond. (PR#1644)

I have partially implemented a lesser version of this, in that the RewriteRule will accept a [NV] option and ignore any varies for that rule, or it's associated conditions.

Potentially this means that if the rules conditions rely on other HTTP_* variables, the corresponding Vary will not be created, and will have to be set manually. However this was acceptible for me (and at the limit of my programming ability :).

I am submitting my patches so that others who may be having the same problems with the mass virtual hosting, using mod_rewrite will be able to fix the issue.
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup mass virtual hosting using something like the following (note: in order to use the lowercase map function, you will also need to apply the mod-rewrite patch located at: http://httpd.apache.org/dist/apache_1.3.17-fix.diff):
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower
  RewriteCond ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}|NONE} ^(www\.)?([^\:\/]+)(\:.*)?$
  RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /%2/$1 [E=FNAME:$1,E=FPATH:/www/%2/$1]

Start up IE 5, and try to use mouseovers or back into a previously loaded page in the virtual domain. Your documents will be reloaded even though they have not expired.
>Fix:
Application of the following patch (to apache_1.3.17 source tree) will allow a [NV] flag to be specified on the RewriteRule to ignore any varies that would be otherwise applied for that rule.

EG:
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower
  RewriteCond ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}|NONE} ^(www\.)?([^\:\/]+)(\:.*)?$
  RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /%2/$1 [E=FNAME:$1,E=FPATH:/www/%2/$1,NV]
