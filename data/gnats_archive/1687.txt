>Description:
I am trying to use %{REMOTE_USER} during the RewriteRule processing.
But when I attempt this set of RewriteRules:

RewriteCond     %{REMOTE_USER}  ^.*johnd
RewriteRule     ^(.*)$  http://www.apache.org/       [P,L]

This proxy is inside an AUTH_TYPE that does ask for my userid and
password, but the rewrite.log file shows this:

little.fsr.com - - [14/Jan/1998:15:30:58 -0800]
[www.some.org/sid#736d8][rid#8a3d0/initial]
(4) RewriteCond: input='' pattern='^.*johnd' => not-matched

The part of this that is preventing me from doing what I want (that is,
to make the RewriteRule based upon a userid obtained from a challenge)
not possible, is that the input=''  so the result of %{REMOTE_USER} is
empty.

I am running Apache 1.2 and I have tried this on 1.2.5 as well.

In case I have the modules compiled in the wrong order, here is the result 
of apache-server -l:
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c

I have tried to follow the code for the setting of the value os
r->connection->user and decided that it might be faster for you
to check the code.  Sorry, I have no suggestions

State-Changed-Why:
r->connection->user isn't set until a much later phase in processing.
mod_rewrite runs during the name translation phase and the user
isn't set until the auth phases.

I don't think there's a clean workaround to this one.  Maybe we
should just update the docs to remove REMOTE_USER as a value which
can be conditionalized.

Incidentally, apache 1.3 supports proxy authentication.

State-Changed-Why:
There _IS_ a clean and elegant workaround for this:
Just use %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER} instead of %{REMOTE_USER}
to look-ahead the variable via sub-request.

No one has noticed this in the past (including myself)
because this %{LA-X:yyy} syntax was totally mis-documented.
The documentation now was corrected.
