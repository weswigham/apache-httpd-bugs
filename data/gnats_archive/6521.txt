 Hi
  I am using the Apache authentication module downloaded from the web .
 (mod_auth_smb.o). Version 1.3.9 running on HPUX10.20 platform. It still
 requires more than one attempts up to the maximum of 8 attempts before i can
 load the entire page. Please advice. This is happenning on both IE amd
 Netscape . Thanks

 To put it another way: *we* don't make mod_auth_smb, so we can't
 help you when it has problems.  It may be a module for Apache,
 but you didn't get it from the Apache site.
