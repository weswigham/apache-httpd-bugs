State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Tue Nov 27 05:58:08 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The Listen directive is required in Apache 2.0.  The Port
and BindAddress directives were removed, now everything is
controlled by Listen (and ServerName, for the proper name
of the server.)
