From time to time all the child processes of httpd die, only the one started by root remains in the queue.
Then you can't connect to the server! Thought by upgrading to glibc would solve the problem, but it just happened again!

Doing the check via cron if httpd is running is a very bad idea....

State-Changed-Why:
Is there anything in the error log?

Did this just start all of a sudden at one time?  If so, is
there anything you did that could have caused it?

Are you using NFS?

Comment-Added:
In addition to what Marc asked -- can you strace the parent
when the problem occurs?  Do this:

strace -p pid_of_parent

and mail us the output.

Thanks

Comment-Added:
Is your problem still occuring?  I'm still interested in
getting an strace of the parent process when the problem
occurs... it sounds like a kernel bug which we're trying
to get more data on so that we can get the linux folks
to fix it.

State-Changed-Why:
Other users report solving a very similar problem by upgrading
to linux 2.0.36 and apache 1.3.6.  If you continue to have
problems after upgrading please open a new report.

Thanks!
