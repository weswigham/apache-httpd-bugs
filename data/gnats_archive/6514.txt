>Description:
I'm trying to install ColdFusion Server 4.5. When I do so it can't find my Apache webserver, I have 1.3.12 installed and running. It sais I have to install manually. Is that done by a module? And if so, where can I download the right module? Or is it another problem?

ColdFusion Module?

State-Changed-Why:
Umh... if you are having trouble with the coldfusion module, 
then we can really do nothing about it.  We don't make that
module and have no idea what its installation program does
and doesn't do.
