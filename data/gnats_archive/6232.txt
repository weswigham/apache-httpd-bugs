 This sounds exactly like what we were doing...  Our log rotation
 script was also sending quite a few sighups in succession (one per
 virtual domain).  I changed the script a while back and have not
 seen the problem since.
 
 David Ernst is alleged to have written:
 -> 
 -> Hello, we've been having quite a bit of trouble with our apache v 1.3.6
 -> running on redhat linux 6.0.  The problem sounds a great deal like
 -> what is being described below.  
 -> 
 -> We believe we have learned something about the problem, and that is
 -> that sending multiple HUP signals to httpd in relatively rapid
 -> succession seems to cause httpd to grow very quickly in size, in many
 -> cases causing the machine to effectively crash and require reboot.  We
 -> first discovered this through a monthly log rotating script which we
 -> wrote ourselves and used happily on our redhat 5.1 system.  The script
 -> rotates over 100 httpd access logs (doing some log analysis on each
 -> one) and sends a HUP to httpd for EVERY ONE of the log files.  
 -> 
 -> Once we had the suspicion, I sat at my command line as root and
 -> repeatedly typed
 -> 
 -> killall -HUP httpd 
 -> 
 -> Perhaps I sent two of these commands per second for about 10 seconds.
 -> Sure enough, ps aux started reporting that httpd had doubled in size.
 -> If I left it alone, it would not grow any further.  But as soon as I
 -> started sending it HUP signals again, the memory would grow
 -> furthermore. 
 -> 
 -> Naturally, stopping the daemon and restarting it "fixed" the problem,
 -> ie, ps aux once again showed the standard httpd footprint.  
 -> 
 -> We have modified our scripts to send fewer HUPs, and I suspect we will
 -> no longer have any problem with this.  All the same, it would be nice
 -> to know that someone is addressing it, and that we may have played a
 -> part in getting it fixed.  Thanks,
