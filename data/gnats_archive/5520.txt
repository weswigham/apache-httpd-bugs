>Description:
I have the same problem as Michael Reutter

with 
  Apache/1.3.4 (Unix) PHP/3.0.7
I could let the user control indexing himself. Extract from http.conf:

  DocumentRoot /www/home   
  <Directory "/www/home">
    Options FollowSymLinks IncludesNOEXEC
    AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Limit
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>

.htaccess in "/www/home/images":
  Options +Indexes

That works beautifully. But on Apache/1.3.9 with http.conf:

  UserDir /www-cgi/daten/home/*/public_html
  <Directory /www-cgi/daten/home/*>
    AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Indexes 
    Options MultiViews SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
  </Directory>

and the same .htaccess-file, I get an "Internal Server Error" (500)

The only difference I see is that the Directory is in the one case in the 
normal document tree, and in the other it is a user dirctory.

In any case I consider it as a bug.

Yours
Mike

PS I've also noted that "IncludesNOEXEC" is more rigorous in Version 1.3.9 - it
does not let me include PHP3 files any more. In 1.3.4 it did not complain.
That is good, but it would be nice to know what has changed, even if it's an
improvement. Or have I overlooked a change note?

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... you have never been able to set "Options +Indexes"
without AllowOverride Options set.  You almost certainly
had some other config difference between the two servers
(since there appear to be a lot of differences other than
one running 1.3.4 and one running 1.3.9).  The most likely
cause is that the section you quote from the old server
didn't apply to what you think it did, ie. the location where
you could do this.

The same thing is probably true for PHP and IncludesNOExec.
Exactly what do you get in the error log when you try, and
exactly how is php configured on each machine?  There are
a bunch of ways to enable php support in your config file,
and different ones work in different ways.

 Of course you're right. I had an "allowOverride all" that I overlooked. 
 Sorry!!
 
 Still I'd like a little more fine control over the options in future 
 versions.
 
 Again my apologies for the mistake. Next time I'll try to check my facts 
 more carefully before I send an error report.
 
 Greetings 
 Mike Middleton
