Sun's jre 1.1.6
>Description:
The java_wrapper passes the classpath to the JVM via the environment variable,
however with Sun's Win32 jre 1.1.6, the environment variable is ignored.  This
took a long time to find.  It would be nice to provide wrapper.classcmd to
specify that the classpath be provided via the command line, instead of the 
environment variable.  That way the platform independent format of the classpath
can be maintained via the multiple wrapper.classpath or '|'.  Otherwise, the
classpath must be provided via the wrapper.parameters using the platform 
separator, etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes.  Just use Sun's win32 jre 1.1.6.
>Fix:
Provide an additional wrapper command to specify the classpath to be passed
via the command line.
