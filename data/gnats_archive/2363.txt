I have used many versions of apache 1.2.x, and there is a symbolic link
in Alias and ScriptAlias realname (full-path).
When I upgraded to apache 1.3.0, apache cannot handle symbolic links.
For example, at apache 1.2.x, I made a symbolic link apache to apache-1.2.6
and I used /sys/apache/cgi-bin at the ScriptAlias ...

State-Changed-Why:
Please be more specific about the problem.  Exactly what
is the directive you are trying to use?  Are you sure you
didn't change any other part of your config files?  Is there
anything in the error log?  What happens when you try the
access under 1.3?

 Apache can handle symbolic links, but there is a default section in the
 distributed access.conf-dist file:
 
 <Directory />
 Options None
 AllowOverride None
 </Directory>
 
 Which disables symlinks.  You have to re-enable them.  Try changing
 "Options None" to "Options FollowSymLinks".
