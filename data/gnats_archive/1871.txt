>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Server Build 1381
233 K6 Intel Triton motherboard
64 megs ram
3.0 Gig hardrive formatted NTFS
>Description:
Running Apache as a service on NT will eventually cause NT Server
to run out of memory. When we stop the Apache service the memory
is reclaimed. On startup 20 megs are free with Apache running as a
service, depending on traffic NT will run out of memory and start paging
to disk in 8-12 hours. Our num of hits is about 8000-10000 hits a day.
