 Correct. Actually there is a second bug: The "awk" above the mentioned
 location in the script instead should read "$AWK".  Seems like we've replaced
 the wrong "awk" with $AWK in the past ;) Both things are now fixed for Apache
 1.3.10.

 Sorry, just adding install-programs is inconsistent. Either we add _all_
 possible targets like install-programs or none.  And because there are lots of
 such targets, I think it's better to leave them out.
 
 Thanks for your feedback.
