>Organization:
>Environment:
WIN32/NT4.0 SP4
>Description:
Garbage collection fails becaus on the WIN32 platform the open() function does not work with directories.
>How-To-Repeat:
Turn on garbage collection
>Fix:
The solution is to use stat instead of open/fstat to differentiate between files/directories.

Here is the patch:
