I have Installed Apache Web Server successfully, but when I try to test my Installation as Start Apache as a Console App. The window shuts down before I could read the messages, I tried to un-install and install again then compared the config files, i find no difference, also there is no error log created.

The problem looks to be simillar to the problem ID 4958, I don't find the solution for the problem in the web site.

Please advise me.

State-Changed-Why:
You need to:

1. Use a current version of Apache.
2. Check the error log.
3. Run it from a DOS window so you can see what it output and
do whatever it says.

 Marc,
     I forgot to mesion  that I did it earlier as you mensioned( I have 
 installed Apacche 1.3.9_win_exec, and following is what I did and got.
 
 my navigation in DOS is c:\Program files\Apache Group\Apache
 
 my command is NET START APACHE
 
 The error that I get is as follows:
 
 Error 2185: Ther service name is invalid. Make sure you are specifying a 
 service name, and then try again.
 
 I don't understand the error, moreover I dont find in windows start up menu
