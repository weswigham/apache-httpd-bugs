>Description:
I am actually using mod_cgid with "threaded" under Linux. I have setup an action that calls 'php' when a file ends in .php . Normally, everything goes fine, but when a querystring is part of the url. I get different results.

I have modified suexec to demo the problem. Here are some suexec logs:

This is a successful invocation:

[2001-10-24 03:35:31]: SUEXEC invoked as: /apache2_0_16/sbin/suexec
[2001-10-24 03:35:31]: Command Parameter: 515 : 99 : php

This is an invocation with a query string:

[2001-10-24 03:34:57]: SUEXEC invoked as: /apache2_0_16/sbin/suexec
[2001-10-24 03:34:57]: Command Parameter: 515 : 99 :
[2001-10-24 03:34:57]: cannot stat program: ()

This is not actually a SUEXEC problem, but I'm not daring enough to play with cgid source code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Invoke any PHP script using the PHP CGI on a suexec server using mod_cgid and tag on a query string.
>Fix:
Sorry.. I'm gonna look at the code tommorow.
