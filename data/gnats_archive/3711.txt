Daily snapshot Apache-JServ-19990118_tar.gz. I can't get 1.0b2 to work :)
>Description:
Running the following configure command produces a Makefile (src/c/Makefile)
with a syntax error:

./configure --prefix=/web/local/jserv \
    --with-apache-install=/web/local/apache \
    --with-jsdk=/web/local/jserv/lib/jsdk.jar

The syntax error is as follows:
===============================
make install
No suffix list.
Making install in src
No suffix list.
Making install in c
Make: line 260: syntax error.  Stop.
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.

The makefile on line 260 (actually 259, 260 is blank) contains:
DEPS_MAGIC := $(shell mkdir .deps > /dev/null 2>&1 || :)

This doesn't look right (but then I'm no make expert).


>How-To-Repeat:
run the configure command line noted above.

 are you using gnu make?
 
 if not, get it and use it. ;-)
