randomly with the following kernel messages:

State-Changed-Why:

Unfortunately, there is nothing in the report that can be
used in tracing the problem to a specific httpd action.
Please let us know if you can repeat it (non-randomly) or
if there is a core file produced that you could run a
backtrace upon.

One possibility is that it is a bad memory SIMM.  I encountered
similar errors on a SPARC 5 system last year and fixed it
by swapping the SIMMs with other systems until the one with the
bad memory crashed.  Such errors are only revealed by Solaris
when a program attempts to use a bad segment in high memory.

No futher followup from user; probably not an Apache 
problem.
