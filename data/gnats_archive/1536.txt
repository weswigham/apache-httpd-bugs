State-Changed-Why:

The archive in question is ok.
You may downloaded the archive in ASCII mode
or your browser (if one was used) is broken
and gunziped the archive on-the-fly without
changing the .gz suffix.
Please try downloading the archive again
and make sure that you download it with
BIN mode turned on.
