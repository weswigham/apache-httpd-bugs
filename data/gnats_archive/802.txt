gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
We changed from NCSA 1.5.2 to apache 1.2-Server and the have in some
directories a ".htaccess" which worked fine with NCSA-Server:

<LIMIT GET POST>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from rzufs1.unizh.ch          #
allow from rzufs1e.unizh.ch         #
allow from rzufs1f.unizh.ch         #
allow from 130.60.44.               #
allow from 130.60.112.101
require group koord
require valid-user
satisfy all
</LIMIT>

With apache1.2 this does not anymore work. The host 130.60.112.101 has
a DNS-Enty (rzusunrom.unizh.ch) and with this ".htaccess" access is denied.
If the IP-Number is replaced with the rzusunrom.unizh.ch, access is 
granted.

This is not the worse case. Worses is the fact, that all hosts in
130.60.44. shuould have access to the directory but they don't get
access, because all have DNS-entires, but are not a separate subdomain.

 Are those #s really in your config files?  They shouldn't be, apache won't
 treat them as comments. 
 
 At any rate, the ip comparison is definately done versus remote_ip, which
 is always in numeric form.  And I use this all the time so I'm unsure how
 it's not working in your case.  Can you try some different orderings of
 the access list?  Maybe eliminate everything except this one case.
