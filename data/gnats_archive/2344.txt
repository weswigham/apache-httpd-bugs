SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-09 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
httpd insists on always using the default ServerRoot and configs,
regardless of the options given to it on the command line.  The symptoms
are overwritten logs and an inability to use separate DocumentRoots
on different machines in a cluster using the same NFS mounted httpd
installation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up and run httpd on machine A, NFS mount that area to machine B,
set up a new ServerRoot on B and run the NFS mounted httpd -d newServerRoot
-f newConfigFile.

State-Changed-Why:
You need to be a bit more specific about exactly what
you see.

Most directory settings in the config files will override
the command line options after they are parsed, so are
you sure you config files aren't the ones setting the
paths?

What do you mean by "overwritten" log file?  Even if you
had two servers writing to the same log, it shouldn't overwrite
them but just result in the entries for both going to the
same file.

 Ack!  You are quite right.
 
 As for overwritten log, read that as overwritten logs/httpd.pid a minor 
 annoyance.
 
 Thanks for the reply.
