apache 1.3.11
>Description:
If you grep through your bug databse under mod_autoindex for readme and header,
and also under mod_dir it should become apparent that many people
have issues getting these features to work.

The documentation only mentions MultiViews in passing,
it basically says that if enabled then autoindex
will look for something like HEADER.en.html, etc...

It does not say, that if you DO NOT do +MultiViews these WILL NOT work.
(I just tracked this down in the bug databse, was checking to see if
it was HEADER's were fixed in 1.3.14).

Further, it does not tell you that the inclusion of text/plain documents
will not occur without MuliViews. And it implies that

HeaderName HEADER

means apache will loook for:

HEADER.*.html 9or however mulitviews names things, I've never needed to use, until now)
HEADER.html
HEADER

Well... the only way I was unable to get a text/plain document
was to name it HEADER.txt, *not* HEADER
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Idealy, nix the depenndency on MultViews
Otherwise, document the hell out of it
