>Description:
After upgrading to 1.3b6 from 1.3b5 I found that I am completely unable to get any responce from ModRewrite. Nothing gets logged (I enabled RewriteLog and set the level to 9), and even the simplest things do not get rewritten.

 Subject: Re: mod_rewrite/2124: Can't invoke the ModRewrite.
 
 Hello,
 
 I believe I found and solved the problem (for myself at least). I was using
 ModRewrite to do major virtual webhosting (it referred to a file to obtain
 the apropriate path for each domain). Obvoiusly for this purpose I required
 to use all of the Rewrite directives outside of a virtual host. The
 following lines of code seemingly prevented me from doing so (I didn't
 bother reading into the exact reasons):
     /*
      *  check for the ugly API case of a virtual host section where no
      *  mod_rewrite directives exists. In this situation we became no chance
      *  by the API to setup our default per-server config so we have to
      *  on-the-fly assume we have the default config. But because the
 default
      *  config has a disabled rewriting engine we are lucky because can
      *  just stop operating now.
      */
     if (conf->server != r->server)
         return DECLINED;
 
 Commenting it out did the trick for me, though I would be very interested to
 know what features I messed up by doing that.
 
 Best Regards,
 Anthony Bourov.

State-Changed-Why:
The current behaviour is correct. No rewrite stuff inside
a virtual host section means no rewrite stuff. The old
implicit inheritance was wrong. If you want to inherit
the rewrite config from the parent/main server you
have to (inside the virtual hosts) both enable the
engine via "RewriteEngine On" _and_ use
"RewriteOption inherit".
