SunOS 4.1.3C, gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
I recently turned proxy caching on and now children do not seem to die off.
They stay in the keepalive state and do not go away.  This causes a large
number of active process even though they are no longer doing anything.	
>How-To-Repeat:
Turn proxy caching on with keepalives.
>Fix:
No
