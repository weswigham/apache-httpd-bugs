>Description:
I have a serious problem.  I was searching the web for a company called "Computer Builders"  based in California and when I typed in the url:  www.computer-builders.com,  I received a message stating that the Apache software had been installed. Also, I received a TON of emails regarding subjects releated to Apache.  I did not mean for any of this to happen and I would like the problem remedied as soon as possible.  

Thank you for  your help,
Ethan
