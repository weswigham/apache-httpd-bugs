apache
>Environment:
SunOS sunmedia 5.8 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-450
gcc 2.95
>Description:
I have Apache 1.3.12 running on a Solaris 2.8 Sparc machine.
I have not made any modifications to apachectl.
When I do any of the following:
  /opt/apache/bin/apachectl restart
  /opt/apache/bin/apachectl graceful
  kill -HUP `cat /opt/apache/logs/httpd.pid`
  kill -USR1 `cat /opt/apache/logs/httpd.pid`

The server dies, and does not restart:
# /opt/apache/bin/apachectl restart
/opt/apache/bin/apachectl restart: httpd restarted
# ps -ef | grep apache
    root 18377 18371  0 15:05:08 pts/5    0:00 grep apache
# /opt/apache/bin/apachectl restart
/opt/apache/bin/apachectl restart: httpd not running, trying to start
/opt/apache/bin/apachectl restart: httpd started
# ps -ef | grep apache
    root 18403 18371  0 15:06:41 pts/5    0:00 grep apache
     www 18396 18395  0 15:05:37 ?        0:00 /opt/apache/bin/httpd

     www 18398 18395  0 15:05:37 ?        0:00 /opt/apache/bin/httpd
    root 18395     1  0 15:05:35 ?        0:00 /opt/apache/bin/httpd
     www 18400 18395  0 15:05:37 ?        0:00 /opt/apache/bin/httpd
     www 18399 18395  0 15:05:37 ?        0:00 /opt/apache/bin/httpd

>How-To-Repeat:
The only thing I can think of is that the -HUP and -USR1 flags might be looking in the wrong place for the httpd.conf file.. but that's a long shot.
