>Organization:

>Environment:
Win32: Occurs on both NT 4 SP6, and Win2k SP1 (Have not tested in UN*X)
Installed the binary release off the web site.
>Description:
This is change from 1.3.12.

Some of our CGI's depend on being able to determine the name of the user attempting to log in to a realm defined in the conf file. (We do some of our own authentication) 

Previously, we could call: getenv("REMOTE_USER") to determine the name of the user. but since installing 1.3.14 the value returned is NULL.

Feature? 
>How-To-Repeat:
The following defines the Realm in the conf file:

# WebNative cgi directory
<Directory C:\PROGRA~1\Xinet\WEBNAT~1\bin>
AllowOverride None
AuthType Basic
AuthName WebNative
require valid-user
AuthUserFile C:\PROGRA~1\Xinet\WEBNAT~1\Admin\apache.userfile
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

When the user attempts to access a file in the directory the browser's authentication dialog comes up and the user types in the name and password.

The cgi used to be able to extract the user name from the REMOTE_USER variable but not after installing 1.3.14.

 Are you using isapi or cgi?  Please clarify, as this is a 
 crucial distinction, as mod_isapi was radically overhauled.
