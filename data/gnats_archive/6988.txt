>Release:        1.3
>Organization:
>Environment:
apache 1.3, its a documentation issue
>Description:
The old default configuration contained a big notice that just adding
VirtualHosts does *not* work, they have to be in the DNS. The otherwise
great new VirtualHost documentation does no longer contain such a notice.

Please put it back in.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Usefull information might be a hint on how to check if the name exists ("nslookup <hostname>" or "host <hostname>") and an explanation of the output and how the DNS hostmaster can be contacted (i.e. "host -t soa <domain>", pick out the e-mail address from the SOA line, etc.).

 Uh, no. I just now noticed that you had asked back once (filtering by
 thread in a large mailbox can be a disadvantage sometimes).
 
 Is further information still required?

State-Changed-Why:

I think I'm going to declare this a "basic DNS" fact
that we expect people to know.  We want to keep
the configuration file from becoming too overloaded.

Thanks for using Apache!
