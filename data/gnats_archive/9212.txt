>Description:
Apache tries to execute files named:
test.cgi.txt or test.cgi.html (others?) on directires with ExecCGI
(but not testcgi.txt)
>How-To-Repeat:
Define a directory with ExecCGI and put a test cgi in it.. do a chmod +x on it
http://host/dir/test.cgi will execute it..
rename it to test.txt
http://host/dir/test.txt will show its contents
rename it to test.lala.txt
http://host/dir/test.lala.txt will show its contents
rename it to test.cgi.txt
http://host/dir/test.cgi.txt will execute it.
do a chmod -x on it and it will give an internal server error
