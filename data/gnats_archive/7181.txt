import javax.naming.InitialContext;
...
public class urs extends HttpServlet

    public void doGet( HttpServletRequest.., HttpServletResponse res) ..
    {
	InitialContext intx=new InitialContext(); // crash!!!
          ....
    }
>Description:
Problem 1:

WHEN STARTING APACHE :: 
In "error.log" in Apache >
ApacheJServ/1.1.1: Exception creating the server socket: java.net.BindException: Address in use: bind
ApacheJServ/1.1.1: Exception creating the server socket: java.net.BindException: Address in use: bind

http:// localhost works perfectly after starting :: 

Problem 2: Now I load a Servlet using JServ: a perfect working servlet, throws following errors:

In error.log in Apache 
: null at org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.processRequest(JServConnection.java, Compiled Code)
at org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.run(JServConnection.java, Compiled Code)

[02/02/2001 20:11:17:732] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "ajpv12"

>How-To-Repeat:
just create a simple servlet having three lines of code, as above
start the apache webs server, the First error occurs
load the servelet . the second error occurs
>Fix:
Nopes, I tried setting classpath, in jserv.properties by using followwing code,
wrapper.classpath=C:\Program Files\Apache JServ 1.1.1\jndi.jar
but nothing works, Also i trid putting giving the jar file in every possible way but it doesnt work.
