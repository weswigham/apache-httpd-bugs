>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0.1381
>Description:
My Apache server was working beautifully yesterday.  Today, it returns a 500
error for any URL.  Nothing is added to the error log, but the following lines
are typical of what is added to the access log:

9.89.8.239 - - [22/Mar/2000:11:40:06 +0000] "GET /testpage.htm HTTP/1.1" 500 539
9.89.11.86 - - [22/Mar/2000:11:41:10 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 500 527

I didn't change a thing--what happened <sniff>?
>How-To-Repeat:
Don't do anything, and come back tomorrow (might not work for you).
>Fix:
No, but I would like to have a way to look up the Apache-specific error codes
that appear in the access log.
