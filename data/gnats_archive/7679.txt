RedHat 7.1 - Linux 2.4.2-2 kernel on a 700 Mhz AMD Duron
>Description:
A SEGV core dump can happen if the system's fully qualified host name
can not be determined.  

In the ap_get_local_host function in main/util.c, it tries to get the 
host name, and if it fails it tries to get the IP from a possibly
null pointer.  The pointer needs to be tested before it is used.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run on a system without a fully qualified domain name in a dns or hosts file.
>Fix:
Here is the code snippet:

        str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0';
        if ((!(p = gethostbyname(str)))
            || (!(server_hostname = find_fqdn(a, p)))) {
            /* Recovery - return the default servername by IP: */
            if (p->h_addr_list[0]) {
                ap_snprintf(str, sizeof(str), "%pA", p->h_addr_list[0]);
                server_hostname = ap_pstrdup(a, str);
                /* We will drop through to report the IP-named server */
            }
        }

To check for a valid pointer, it should be:

        str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0';
        if ((!(p = gethostbyname(str)))
            || (!(server_hostname = find_fqdn(a, p)))) {
            /* Recovery - return the default servername by IP: */
