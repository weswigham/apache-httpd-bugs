>Description:
much to my chagrin there is apparently no documentation on how to use
this module.  yes, I looked in the modules section of the manual.  I 
found some out of date source and gleaned the general ideas out but it 
isn't working and I can't guess how to debug it or even where to find 
error output (it's not in /var/log/apache/errors.log nor any other log 
files).  As you might imagine, it's pretty frustrating.

perhaps this is a debian packaging omission, but I can't find any information
at www.apache.org either.  thankyou for your time
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Even the most basic stuff would be great.  Any kind of examples.  A pointer
to more up to date source code.  anything!

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a module distributed with the base Apache
package, so neither do we distribute documentation for
it.  Please contact the module's author, or the site/person
from whom you obtained it.
