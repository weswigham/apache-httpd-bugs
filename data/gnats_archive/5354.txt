>Description:
i am using apache v1.3.9 as a proxy/cache in an environment where there is an upstream cache. i have apache configured to point to the upstream cache using ProxyRemote. Everything works fine as long as authentication is not turned on at the upstream cache. 
                       
if it is, when the browser issues a GET, it is passed to apache, then forwarded by apache to the upstream cache.  the upstream cache issues a 407 (Proxy-Authenticate: in the header) back to apache. apache forwards that back to the browser. the browser responds and passes the authentication back to apache. now the problem: apache strips the authentication response out of the header and passes the request to the upstream cache (where it reissues a 407 again). 
                       
browser:GET --> apache:GET --> upstreamcache:407 --> apache:407 --> browser:GET/Proxy-Authenticate --> apache:GET/{NO auth info]
--> upstreamcache:407 --> apache...
                       
i have seen a number of posts that discuss similar issues, however they tend to place blame on the browser which does not make sense in this case since i can see the browser responding properly in my traces.  obviously there is an issue because the following code snippet says so! 
                
 reqhdrs_arr = ap_table_elts(r->headers_in);
    reqhdrs = (table_entry *) reqhdrs_arr->elts;
    for (i = 0; i < reqhdrs_arr->nelts; i++) {
        if (reqhdrs[i].key == NULL || reqhdrs[i].val == NULL
        /* Clear out headers not to send */
            || !strcasecmp(reqhdrs[i].key, "Host")      /* Already sent */
            /* XXX: @@@ FIXME: "Proxy-Authorization" should *only* be
             * suppressed if THIS server requested the authentication,
             * not when a frontend proxy requested it!
             */
            || !strcasecmp(reqhdrs[i].key, "Proxy-Authorization"))
            continue;
        ap_bvputs(f, reqhdrs[i].key, ": ", reqhdrs[i].val, CRLF, NULL);
    }


i can get this to work in my current environment, however i am concerned as to what it is that i will be allowing to happen once i do so. there has to be a reason why the 'quick fix' was applied above (i assume that code commented with FIXME is a quick fix! :o). i can see why stripping this information out has value because it is a license to 'spoof' on a shared ip address, but i am in a closed environment where authentication should (and must) only reside at the perimeter of the entire network. is it a security issue? a lack of standard? bad juju?


thanks

>How-To-Repeat:
just point an apache to a proxy requiring authentication
>Fix:
the 'fix' that we have implemented is to simply pass authentication requests on. this is very simple, so i am quite sure that there is a reason why you are not allowing this.
