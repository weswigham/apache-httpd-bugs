OS: IRIX64 mouse 6.5 10181058 IP27
cc: MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.30
>Description:
Running buildconf or `make install' will result in the error 
`*** Error code 1 (bu21)'.  The documentation for make does not 
explain what this error means.  However, ./configure, make, 
`make install-{conf,htdocs,icons,other,cgi,include,support}' work, 
and httpd can be hand copied to the proper location.

After the manual installation, it seems to run ok.
>How-To-Repeat:
As far as I know, it can be repeated.  Don't know of any reason 
why it wouldn't be repeatable on the same IRIX platform.
>Fix:
Make doesn't give any information as to what the problem is, so no idea
where to start looking to fix it.

State-Changed-Why:
Could you test with a later version of Apache 2.0?  The build
system has been completely overhauled since this bug was
reported.  I do not know of one specific fix that has solved
this problem, but I believe that enough changes have been
commited that we may have already solved this problem.

I just did a quick search on Google for this error string,
and it looks like IRIX make returns this string whenever the
build fails due to a compilation error.  Could you check to
ensure that there are no other errors when you try to build?

Thank you for using Apache.  If the problem is not resolved,
please let us know.
