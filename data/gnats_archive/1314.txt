OSF1 bt1sdo31 V3.2 62 alpha (V3.2G)
DEC C compiler
>Description:
I experience the same kind of problem as the one described in PR #1273.

I run Apache 1.3b2 on a DEC Alpha Server 8400 (model EV56/440, RAM 4 Go, 4 CPU) under Digital Unix 3.2G, and after approximately 5-7 Hours, the Web Server continues to reply to my requests, but the system "seems" to be hanged.

I can't use the system commands under /bin (linked to /usr/bin) but 
those under /sbin work fine (that's what shows problably the system as hanged).
We can visit all the disk except the /usr part of it (using /sbin/ls instead of /bin/ls).

For information: apache is installed in /usr/local/apache/

Did you investigate the problem further more ? Do you have any news
from others users ?
>How-To-Repeat:
It's easy... Start the Web Server and wait for 5 to 7 hours...
>Fix:
I'm looking for a fix... As steve (cf #1273) does for Solaris, I will try the 1.2.4 release of Apache.

 How much swap space is left?  How many httpd processes are running?  Any
 messages in your various system error logs?  Any messages on the console?

 Dean,
 
 In your previous mail, you wrote:
 > How much swap space is left?  
 
 CPU usage: 0,01 % (on 4 CPU)
 Free swap space: 2,3 Go
 Free RAM space: 3,4 Go
 
 > How many httpd processes are running?
 
 8 httpd processes.
 
 > Any messages in your various system error logs?
 
 None on Apache, none in syslog (it's very difficult to diagnose).
 
 > Any messages on the console?
 
 None.
 
 Thanks.

 I can't believe that a system with 2.3Gb of RAM, and 4 CPUs doing nothing
 is "locked up" by Apache.  What resource has run out?  I don't know OSF at
 all, so I can't suggest what tools you should be using to find out why
 your system is sick.  Try an OSF newsgroup. 
 
 You can also try this patch below, apply it to src/main/conf.h.  Then
 rebuild the server from scratch.

 Dean,
 
 I've change the machine, and put Apache 1.3b2 on a DEC Alpha Station.
 (I can't continue to hang a DEC Alpha Server 8400 every 6 hours)
 
 Description of the Alpha Station:
 Alpha 500 400 Mhz
 FREE RAM 0.5 GB
 FREE SWAP 2.0 GB
 DISK 20 GB (RAID 5)
 DEC OSF/1 3.2G
 
 I hope to reproduce the problem in the next 6 hours on it,
 then I will try your patch.
 
 Thanks a lot for your (fast) answer.
                                       
 Emmanuel DECAEN

 Dean,
 
 On the Alpha Station, the problem doesn't occur...
 Apache is running since 2 days without problem (and without your patch).
 
 I'm currently comparing the Alpha Server and the Alpha Station, to try 
 to find the difference. I will give you more information tomorrow.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Emmanuel DECAEN

 Dean,
 
 The problem seems to be solved...
 
 Apache 1.3b2 doesn't work more than 6 hours on version 3.2G of Digital 
 Unix (DEC OSF/1), if you don't install the following patches:
 
 FIX:
 
 - OSFPAT00017700375 installed Patch: Various Socket & Network 
 Corrections (Network Patches)
 
 - OSFPAT00018000375 installed Patch: libc and shutdown Utility 
 Corrections (Library Patches)
 
 (more information available with dupatch utility)
 
 If you want more information, you can contact me.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Emmanuel DECAEN
