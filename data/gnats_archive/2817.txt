>Description:
I've been running a production server on Linux with NCSA httpd for
about three years now.  I have upgraded the NCSA server with no
problems.  (I was a Beta tester and ported to several platforms.)

Now I'm trying Apache (I've been using it everywhere else for some
time, so I'm familiar with it - I maintain lots of servers on lots
of systems).  One problem is giving me fits, and keeping me from
switching to Apache on this one system.

We have over 3,000 HTML pages [1] on this system, and run two virtual
servers.  There are pages in both DocumentRoots, and about a dozen
users have their own public_html directories.  There are probably 100
or so scripts.  Everything works beautifully when I switch to the
Apache server EXCEPT...

One user's main index page contains several links to subdirectories
of the form:

   <A HREF="/~eluser/hobbit">...</A>

Which correctly redirect to /~eluser/hobbit/ , and this directory
has an index.html file .  Of the five links like this, three work
fine (returning Content-type: text/html) .  The other two, however,
pop up a dialog box (on Navigator 3.x and 4.x and lynx), because
they are returning 

   Content-type: text/x-server-parsed-html

.  (I determined this by running telnet on the server port, of course).
I have configured the server to parse *all* .html files (this site
predates the .shtml standard, and almost every page on it uses SSI),
but this has never been a problem with any version of NCSA from 1.2
through 1.5.x .

This happens with Apache 1.2.6 and 1.3 .  I started with fresh conf files,
and tweaked them minimally for my site.  I have no non-standard modules.
I have tested almost the entire site at this point, and only these two
links are problematical.  I created a similar directory structure in my
own public_html/ and it works *fine* there.  I later cloned the offending
tree and saw the same behavior, even when I reduced the index files slowly
down to nothing.

Three things that may be either clues or red herrings:

- The two directories giving me fits have names 2 and 6 characters long,
  the three which work fine have names 3 and 5 characters long.
- I modified the Apache 1.3 source tree by changing te only occurance
  of text/x-server-parsed-html to text/html and it made no difference.
  I have verified that there is no such string as text/x-server-parsed-html
  in the binary!
- Only one of the offending index.html files actually uses SSI.

The offending directories are drwxr-sr-x, but I have explicitly set XBitHack
to off, just to be safe.  There is no discernable difference between these
directories or their index files and any others.

The "White Wabbit" and "Pat Hester - Cyberfreak" links will fail,
the others will work fine.

 OK, I screwed up.  The user had a .htaccess file with the old
 NCSA style line in it:
 
    AddType text/x-server-parsed-html .html
 
 The guy knows better, but this has been hanging around for ages
 and he forgot about it, and I just missed it.
 
 My apologies.
