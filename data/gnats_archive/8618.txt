>Description:
When I try to start the Apache console it apparently it works, but after some instants the console closes, without happening anything else. The message that appears in the log file is the following: "[crit] (2)No such file or directory: make_sock: failed to get a socket for port 80".
After several attempts to open the console the message in the log file changes, and of there in before it only appears that message: "[crit] make_sock: failed to get a socket for port 80".
This is the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
It occurs locally.
>Fix:
No.
