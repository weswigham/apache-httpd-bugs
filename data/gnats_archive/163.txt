>Description:
I had some trouble getting the suexec wrapper to work (the problem was a
GID that didn't exist in the config).

It turned out that logging of errors from the call_exec routine simply went
nowhere at all. More investigation gave the following rather easy patch to
util_script.h:
void call_exec (request_rec *r, char *argv0, char **env, int shellcmd) 
{
    char *execuser;
    core_dir_config *conf;
    struct passwd *pw;
    struct group *gr;
    char err_string[HUGE_STRING_LEN];
    
+    /* Brutality incarnate - make all those log_unixerr statements work!!!! */
+    r->server->error_log = stderr;

This makes my class of config problems much easier to debug.




>How-To-Repeat:
If you can't reproduce it by putting a wrong group in your own config,
I'll happily reproduce mine at http://counter.li.org/cgi-bin/test, but
in the meantime, I hoep to fix it.

See above. Keep up the good work%2

Hi Harald,

Your fix looks fine, so we have added it to the next release.
Thanks.
