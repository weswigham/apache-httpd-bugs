NT server 4.0
>Description:
You guys just don't know how much I appreciate the latest release, 1.3b3 for
NT.  I've had to struggle along for months with MS's lousy Internet Information
Server.  Now most things work, instead of most things don't work.  What's left
is my fault, not the server's.  That's the way things should work, and it's the
way Apache works--it just does.  Bravo, and thank you!

So my suggestion is why not have an e-mail address where we can just send 
``Job well done'' e-mail instead of only bug reports?  ;-)
>How-To-Repeat:
Keep up the great work.
>Fix:
Yeah....add an e-mail address for non-bug reports;-%2
