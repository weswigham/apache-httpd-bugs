>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0
Service pack 5
Visual C 5.0
>Description:
I want to build Apache 1.3.9 because I need mod_proxy.         

I am compiling the ApacheCore project but it does not find the two include files :

                    test_char.h, uri_delims.h
        
when compiling util.c and util_uri.c
                     
>How-To-Repeat:
Just download the Windows package and try to rebuild it.
>Fix:
Add the two files to the package.

State-Changed-Why:

That is correct.  You must build the project with 
makefile.nt (now makefile.win in apache-1.3.13 and later)
since those are created by system analysis applets that
determine the nature of your libraries and processor.
