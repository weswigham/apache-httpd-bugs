Sorry to bother you, but do you have any suggestions for locating the
cause of "send lost connection" errors appearing in the error log?

I frequently see this error when users attempt to access these URLs, among
others:

http://tpot.ucsd.edu/cat9697.pdf
http://tpot.ucsd.edu/Cataloging/Misc/top200.html

Thank you in advance for any leads you might have.

State-Changed-Why:

The server will lose the connection with the client if the
user presses "Stop" on their browser.  It is an indication
that your file sizes and/or number of images per page
are larger than the patience of your site's users.
