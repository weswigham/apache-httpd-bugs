Red Hat Linux 2.0.33
>Description:
I'm using Analog to process log files, and every once in a while now the total numbers of everything will drop and the start date will change. The only thing I can think of for this to happen is that log files are being auto-deleted. Is this something that Apache does? And if so, is there a way to stop it? These numbers are important to our clients.

State-Changed-Why:
No, Apache does no such things.  If you are using Red Hat's
RPM, however, it does many things, one of which may well be
rotating the log files.  You need to check with them to see
how this is done and how you can stop it.

 You are correct.. I moved that file to a directory named do_nothing. Thanks.
