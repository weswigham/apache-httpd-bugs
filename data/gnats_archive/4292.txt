>Description:
Following the concerts links out of www.ticketmaster.com  (for example) does not
return the html -- presumably the mime type is not understood by the
proxy (apache). Accessing the page directly without the proxy works fine. 

The mime type actually turns out to be something more than
just text/html -- this confuses Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow the concerts link from www.ticketmaster.com
>Fix:
We have just terminated the mime type after text/html.
Not sure whether this will cause other problems but seems to
work for now.
