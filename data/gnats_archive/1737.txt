IRIX 6.2, IP22, 64Mb RAM
Compiler: cc
>Description:
I have always been able to compile and run Apache on my Irix box fairly easily.
I'm running a mSQL databse which used a web interface for both admins and users.
As such, there's a great need for authentication so that only admins can adminster and only legitimate users can use.

With the new version of Apache, 1.3, mod_auth_msql is no longer provided with other modules and when I tried to download the old one and include it in, it didn't like it!
The compiler complained about an older 32-bit app being compiled with a newer module etc.
That seems to be because in the Configuration file I have to include the mSQL libraries to be read and those are (or seem to be) what causes the problem.
I tried recompiling my mSQL and then compiling Apache 1.3 again, but that didn't work either.

Any chance of including mod_auth_msql in the standard modules again?
I do like to use the new release since I hear it's considerably faster.

Maybe with a commented line (like before) in Configuration%3

State-Changed-Why:
No, we really don't want to provide it any more for two reasons.
First, it is very restricted and there are a lot more databases
than msql.  Second, there is on one around to maintain it or
support it and it is really an outside thing.

It sounds like you are trying to link an old .o file with
a new binary.  Try removing mod_auth_msql.o before
compiling.

It sounds as though you created a src/modules/msql
directory and put mod_auth_msql.c in it.  What else
have you done to compile it?  What's in that directory?
What changes did you make to your Configuration file?
Can you send me (please do not copy apbugs@Apache.Org)
your Configuration file and the src/modules/msql/Makefile?
Send them to <coar@Apache.Org>.

 Then you probably compiled one of the two with -n32 and one wit, or
 something similar.
 
 Try changing the IRIXN32 line in your Configuration file to no.

 Yes Mark, I already tried that. I tried recompiling msql too and then I
 tried Apache again. I tried Apache with IRIXN32 set to both yes and no at
 different times, neither worked! :(
 I already sent my Configuration and the Makefile from src/modules/standard
 to coar.
 
 I never had -any- problems with 1.2.* releases of Apache. It has been one of
 the rare products that compiled without any tweeking on Irix boxes which
 maybe known for their weird configs.

State-Changed-Why:
This really looks to be some IRIX mess with all the 
various binary interfaces available.  Since there is
almost certainly nothing wrong with Apache, and the suggestions
haven't worked... then I'm afraid we really can't suggest
anything else.  If you ask on an IRIX newsgroup or somewhere
they may be able to help you if you haven't solved it yet.
