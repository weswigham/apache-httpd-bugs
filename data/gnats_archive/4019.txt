Hello,

I would to post request about addition of a few feature, which should have been implemented in Apache previously.

A directive allowed in .htaccess which will prevent the execution of any other .htaccess in its sub-dirs (but except that dir which contains the .htaccess).

that will be very helpful in many ways.

Thank you.

ps. If its already there and I just have missed it, I apologize and please kindly refer me to that directive.
