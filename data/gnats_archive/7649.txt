>Description:
Wherever docs mention hardcoding configuration options, they say to copy
src/Configuration.tmpl to src/Configuration, then edit src/Configuration with
site customizations.

However, the top-level configure script (APACI?) subverts this, reading from
src/Configuration.tmpl. Furthermore, it -appears- to ignore AddModule and
SharedModule directives, preferring its --enable-module=... directives. My
enabling of mod_so through an AddModule directive actually seems to have worked,
but the other modules, all of which I marked with "SharedModule" are still
being statically linked into the core executable.
>How-To-Repeat:
tar -xvzf apache_1.3.19.tar.gz
cd apache_1.3.19
cp src/Configuration.tmpl src/Configuration
perl -pi -e 's|^AddModule|SharedModule|' src/Configuration
perl -pi -e 's|^\# (AddModule.*/mod_so.*)$|$1|' src/Configuration
./configure --with-layout=opt
make install
/opt/apache/sbin/httpd -l

Note that output lists lots of statically linked modules, and does not
list mod_so, which we specifically enabled.
>Fix:
Reading from Configuration instead of Configuration.tmpl is trivial :) The larger
issue of recognizing AddModule and SharedModule directives from Configuration is
another matter. No clue. Sorry :)

State-Changed-Why:

This behavior is by design.  If you use the "configure" script in the root directory, then you must make all changes on the configure command line (see the ./INSTALL file), and you should not touch src/Configuration.  If you edit src/Configuration, then you must use src/Configure (see src/INSTALL).

I agree this is confusing, and perhaps not well documented, but you need to be sure not to mix the two systems.  This problem has gone away in Apache httpd 2.0 since autoconf is used.

Thanks for using Apache!
