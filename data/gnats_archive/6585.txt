>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.10 #7 Suse 6.2
egcs-2.91.66 (1.1.2 release)

>Description:
While accessing a Webcam with Server-Push technology (like an Axis cam) the
Proxy continues to get traffic from the Cam after the Client that requested the
page has gone away. This results in a heavy traffic load. Cache Force Completion
is deaktivated (100).
This seems like a reproducable variant of my report #5391
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to access 194.94.26.168 and then Server Push from the Cam via the 
Apache-Proxy. After starting the Push the Proxy won't terminate even after the
Client exited and even the Client computer is down.
