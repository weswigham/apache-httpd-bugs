>Environment:
Currently using Netware 5.1 with service pack 3 applied
(problem also occurred with the other service packs applied)
>Description:
We are trying to port our current website, running on UNIX -Apache/1.3.9 (Unix)
to Netware to allow easier management on a new server. Started to replicate our
current UNIX setup onto the new Netware server. This set-up encompasses the use
of SSI for our navigation menus, etc.

Following the instructions in the set-up and the example of our current set-up
I allowed SSI to be enabled on the Netware. I copied a file with SSI commands,
from the UNIX server, to demonstrate that SSI works.

Upon loading this page the server abends with the error code
SERVER-5.0-4631 [nmID=1001C] (this is similiar to the problem
http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/7281 raised by Ron Davies).

I eventually worked out that the server abending is caused by the includes
command for both virtual and file.  Removing, or renaming the files so that
they do not have an .htm, .html or .shtml extension, allows the page to be
rendered properly and all the SSI commands are parsed as expected.

*******************************
I would be grateful for any assistance that you might be able to give.
>How-To-Repeat:
Server is a development server and is currently not
accessible to external browsing.
>Fix:
I have tried to use file extensions other than .htm or .html or .shtml  This
does allow the files to be included and parsed correctly without the server
abending.

I have tried altering the httpd.conf to alter the server parsed section
but with no success. Our intention would be to copy all our files across
from the UNIX server with very few, if any, alterations.
