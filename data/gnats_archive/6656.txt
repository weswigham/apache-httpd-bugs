>Description:
When server receives a connection from a slow client (ie modem user) the connection never appears to clear causing the server to sit between 85-87% utilization in Monitor.nlm.  

The way I get around this is to load TCPCON.nlm select "protocol inforamation" - "TCP" - "TCP Connections" and then clear the connections on port 80 that correspond to our modem pool users.  At this point Utilization in Monitor drops back down to 1-2%
