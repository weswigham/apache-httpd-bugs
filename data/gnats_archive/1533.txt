State-Changed-When: Mon Dec  8 22:57:36 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This is a known bug, listed on the known bugs page. For some
reason, use of the ISAPI module causes crashes unless the
server is compiled in debugging mode. We believe that some
optimization performed by Visual C++ is causing this, but have
been unable to locate the problem so far.

Thanks for using Apache,

State-Changed-Why:
This does indeed turn out to be an optimiser bug. It has been
worked around for the next release (1.3b4).
