>Description:
In the docs on Rewrite* there is no "Override FileInfo"

However in http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/2446 I found the following:
"AllowOverride FileInfo" enables 21 directives:
ErrorDocument, DefaultType; Action; Redirect*; Header;
Add*, ForceType, SetHandler; LanguagePriority; Rewrite*;
CookieTracking

Additionally my universitys server (kastor.inf.tu-dresden.de) reject the
attempt to Redirect in my .htaccess with "Redirect not allowed here" and 
I know that AllowOverride FileInfo is not enabled there.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at:
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_alias.html#redirect

Thanks for the note. The documentation of the Redirect*
directives has been updated to show that the FileInfo
override is required.
