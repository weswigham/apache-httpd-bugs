>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP3, MS Visual C++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
The behavior of path information on Win32 Apaches is still broken on 1.3b7
(PR #2274).  However, on 1.3b7 it is broken differently.  The behavior of double
slashes is still the same: any double slashes in the path info are stripped.

for example:

http://myhost/ascript.cgi/foo//bar

path_info() returns 'foobar'

The behavior with a single trailing slash is broken in a different way.  If 
there is no path information and a single trailing slash, such as 
http://myhost/ascript.cgi/, things work OK.  But if there is some path info,
such as http://myhost/ascript.cgi/foobar/, Apache returns a 404 Not Found.  The
error log complains

[Thu Jun 04 08:50:44 1998] [error] File does not exist: 
d:/apache\htdocs\housing\logon.perl\654\564\/

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Apparently Apache is trying to do some kind of slash translation to access the
file on the disk, but it should do it =after= it separates the filename from the
path information.

 I have already patched my server with the new util_win32.c, and it seems to
 fix the problem without causing any new ones.
 
 Thanks,
