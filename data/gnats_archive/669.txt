>Description:
I have written a module (mod_put) to handle the HTTP/1.1 PUT and DELETE methods.
It uses 3 per-directory config directives: EnablePut, EnableDelete and umask to
restrict access and set umask for created files/dirs.
Sending of PUT /this/is/a/test/index.html will result in the creation of dirs
'this', 'is', 'a' and 'test' and file 'index.html' with the gien umask.

Provides full support for Netscape Gold 'Publish' feature.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I just wonder where to submit mod_put for test and validation

State-Changed-Why:
I suggest you check out the Apache Modules Registry; this
sounds like a very good candidate.  A pointer to the
registry can be found on the Apache web site at
<http://www.apache.org/related_projects.html>.

Thank you for using Apache!
