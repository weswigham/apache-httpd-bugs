>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
FreeBSD 3.4, FreeBSD 3.2
>Description:
I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature. But at least if was not like that before
and now even with old Apache configuration file I get this problem:

I have files with .html, .gif and other extensions. 
If I do not specify extension (e.g. use just 'image' instead of 'image.gif' in url), the server manages to find them anyway.

If this is not a bug, how do I disable this? Apparently this is something with the configuration as not every Apache 1.3.12 server on the internet has this "problem".
>How-To-Repeat:
The "normal" url is http://www.apache.org/foundation/FAQ.html
but you can also open it by this url: http://www.apache.org/foundation/FAQ
Sam e with images: http://www.apache.org/images/apache_pb opens apache_pb.gif image instead of returning error.
>Fix:
I am confused - it could be  some kind of "default" behaviour, not a bug,
although I do not think it is useful (what if you have some  important script with the same name as image or html document - which one will be opened?).
If this is a bug, tt may also pose some security risks.

 I made some more testing. 
 
 Aparently this problem is related to mod_negotiation and specifically 
 to Option MultiViews. If I disable it, the problem dissapears.
 
 I initially suspected this MultiViews option behaved in a wrong way - 
 thought that it does not respect the actial extension of the file  
 and makes script source viewing possible. Yet, apparently I was wrong 
 (problem was with proxy cache/file renaming).
 
 Sorry!
