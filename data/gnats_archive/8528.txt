Linux 2.2.14-12.8RS
>Description:
Recently upgraded to 1.3.20 with DSO.  Now, all .htaccess files that use flat .htpasswd files generate 500 errors, but there is no logging in either the vhost's error log, nor the general server error log.  The only things logged are the initial 401 and subsequent 500 in the vhost access log.

The password prompt appears and, no matter what you enter (valid or not), when you submit you get the 500 page.

There is no core dump.  I've tried moving the auth directives into httpd.conf, turning up LogLevel all the way ... all without effect.  Vhosts/.htaccess files that use mod_auth_mysql work fine.  I've triple checked my .htaccess for spelling mistakes.
