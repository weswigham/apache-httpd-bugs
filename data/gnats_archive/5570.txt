with all the year 2000 patches also.
>Description:
When using virtual servers (HTTP 1.1), apache sometimes (after some days, a lot of times!!), reports it does not have permissions to read some file (usualy the index).

The error log reports:
(2)No such file or directory: file permissions deny server access: something/htdocs/indexptmm.html

The thing is the file has all the permissions right and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn´t!!
>How-To-Repeat:
I don´t know...
>Fix:
The only way I found is to restart the server. (apachectl stop, apachectl start)
Note: If you do apachectl restart it does not work!
