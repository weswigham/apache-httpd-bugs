>Description:
When Multiviews is enabled and a client requests a page without specifying an Accept-Language:
header a random language variant is returned. If an Accept-Language: header is given
the proper page is always returned.

It is unclear from reading about the negotiation algorithm at
http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html
what is done in the case when no Accept-Language: header is given. In other
words, how are quality factors decided when no Accept-Language: header is given?
I get the impression that when that header is missing, the .html version should
be served if it exists.
>How-To-Repeat:
I used lines such as
wget -S -O - --header="Accept-Language: it" http://www.debian.org/devel/people | head -4
to see what apache was returning for different requests. Remove the --header=
option and notice that the italian page is served.

The following language variants of the file exist:
lrwxrwxrwx   1 treacy   debwww         14 Oct 12 11:09 devel/people.html -> people.html.en

Comment-Added:

I'm not able to reproduce your problem.
Are you using any third-party modules?

 No. The list of modules uncommented in httpd.conf are:
   LoadModule config_log_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_log_config.so
   LoadModule mime_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_mime.so
   LoadModule negotiation_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_negotiation.so
   LoadModule autoindex_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_autoindex.so
   LoadModule dir_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_dir.so
   LoadModule cgi_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_cgi.so
   LoadModule userdir_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_userdir.so
   LoadModule alias_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_alias.so
   LoadModule access_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_access.so
   LoadModule expires_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_expires.so
 
 This is a straight compile of 1.3.3. There were sporadic reports of
 the wrong language being served in the past, but it has gotten worse
 as mirrors (the Debian pages are mirrord to over 15 sites) have upgraded
 to newer versions of apache.
 
 I am willing to recompile apache and turn on any debugging options if needed.
 Any tips on diagnosing the problem would be helpful. I'd like to get this
 fixed asap.
 
 As reported before, the problem only occurs when the client does not send
 Accept-Language: header,i.e. the user does set any language preferences.
 The language returned is constant across requests. If the wrong language
 is returned, future requests return the same language. It is not a caching
 problem as I can reproduce the problem on my machine at home.

 The problem has been found. A patch and explanation follow.
 
 Subroutine is_variant_better in mod_negotiation.c states that if the
 languages are equal to try the LanguagePriority. Fair enough. But if
 best->lang_index != -1 and variant->lang_index == -1 it believes the
 variant is better than the current best so it doesn't return 0 when it
 should. It then recognizes in the next 'if' statement that the variant
 is not better so continues until it uses the length of the files to
 decide which is better.
 
 The fix is to simply check for variant->lang_index == -1
 
 With the correction the only condition that lets you fall through this
 section is if best->lang_index == variant->lang_index == -1
 This implies that neither is in LanguagePriority.
 
 As noted in the original message, this only affects requests for which
 there is no Accept-Language: header sent.

State-Changed-Why:

mod_negotiation was updated and extended for our
forthcoming 1.3.4 release. Additionally a
DefaultLanguage directive has been added to Apache.

The changes should address your problem...
Please open a new problem report if you still
encounter problems.

Thanks for using Apache.
