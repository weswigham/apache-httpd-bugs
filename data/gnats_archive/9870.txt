>Organization:
>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 7.2
>Description:
After I connected to Internet, given IP address (for example 12.84.12.109) and have apache running I can access sites by "http://12.84.12.109/~apolar", where apolar is alias and users name.  However, I can not connect to same address from another PC.  I have two computers at home and two phone lines.  None of my aliases or document root is visible from another PC, though they all are visible from inside the same machine as localhost or given IP address.  The problem is not in directories permission, I changed them back and forth. It does not help.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I read documents, I'm reading specialy devoted book to Linux Apache Web Server Administration (by Charles Aulds).  They don't contain such problem description.

State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Tue Feb 19 08:22:22 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug report, but rather a support question.
Therefore, it should be directed to one of the support
resources listed in the FAQ:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#what2do

In your particular case, the problem is, in all
likelihood, a network configuration problem on your
linux box.  Check to see if you have a firewall
installed on the box that is blocking access.

Thanks for using Apache!
