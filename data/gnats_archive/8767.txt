Not applicable
>Description:
The gzipped documentation pdf file available from the site is significantly out of date and has the sections ordered incorrectly with respect to the index: this makes reading the documention from a printout of the PDF file very unpleasant.

This refers to
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Apache-1.3-docs.pdf.gz
dated 03-Apr-2000 13:03  
>How-To-Repeat:
In the PDF file, go to the page on "starting apache". This is page 164. page down. the next section, according to the index, should be "stopping and restarting apache". Instead, that is on page 158 and the next section is actually "Apache Module mod_proxy"
>Fix:
Build a new PDF file from the html files specifying the correct order. Preferrably also add the facilities to the CVS sources to do the build easily

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Thu Nov 15 14:19:31 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

I've moved that pdf file to the "old" directory so it
won't confuse people.  Unfortunately, we don't have
good method for creating pdf out of our pure html docs.
