OS Linux 2.00 Kernell version gcc 2.7.2 W3-mMSQL authentification model 
patch
>Description:
I´ve been triying to user POST method with CGI 
with an W3mSQL Authentification pach to pass authentification
headers to CGI. 

 It does NOT work with apache 1.2b6, I get an 
   " Ouch!  malloc failed in malloc_block()" 

 from the httpd and "no data" on the browser.

>How-To-Repeat:
Any POST form
>Fix:
Do not use this pach with 1.2b

State-Changed-Why:
You say you are having trouble with a patch?  What patch?
We can't support all the patches that people make.  It is
most likely a problem with the patch.  Do you have any
reason to think it is a problem with Apache itself?  Have
you talked to the author of the patch?
