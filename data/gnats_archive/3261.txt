Version 1.3 for Win32, downloaded 16. Oct 1998
>Description:
The Apache server software will correctly execute Perl scripts on the 
same machine. It requires the full and correct path after the #!,
just like with Linux. The problem is that it refuses to execute an .exe program
for not having the #!.

Apache needs to recognize a Windows binary executable by its file
suffix .exe.

State-Changed-Why:
What Win32 system are you using (e.g. Windows NT, Win95, 
Win98)?  When apache starts what is the specific release
number (e.g. 1.3.3, 1.3.4 dev)?
Are you executing from the cgi-bin directory?
Is ScriptAlias set up correctly?  Is the CGI 16-bit or
32-bit?

State-Changed-Why:
AAAAhhhhh... Looks like the error log has the answer.
In fact it appears that apache is executing your CGI.  The
problem seems to be that the CGI is generating an
incorrect header.
You need to fix the CGI, be sure that the header is
something like:
Content-type: text/html
or whatever content type you want.
