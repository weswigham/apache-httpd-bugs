>Description:
I've created a script to execute 'uname -a' when called, but from
the client side, I get 'Forbidden' and from the server log I get
'ExecCGI is off in this directory...'.

I edited the configuration and added Options ExecCGI to the directive
and even created other directives but none rememdy the problem.

<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs">
...
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/uname">
...
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

<DirectoryMatch "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/uname/*">
...
Options ExecCGI
</DirectoryMatch>

Client-Side:
------------
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /uname/index.cgi on this server.
Apache/1.3.6 Server at www.intranova.net Port 80

Server-Side:
------------
Thu Jul 22 14:12:19 1999] [error] [client 209.3.31.74] 
Options ExecCGI is off in this directory: 
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/uname/index.cgi
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.intranova.net/uname/
>Fix:
None whatsoever come to mind at the time.
