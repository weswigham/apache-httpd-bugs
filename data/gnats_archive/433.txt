I'm using 

ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/nph-cgiwrap/mist/error/nph-404.cgi

in my .htaccess to provide custom 404 error handling.  This was
working fine until we upgraded to 1.2b7.  Now it appears to be handling
other users' 404 errors, but only some of them, and intermittently.

The nph-404.cgi script in question is a simple /bin/sh script which
outputs some html that incorporates the $SERVER_NAME, etc. environment
variables.  It also logs the error to a file with:

log='/home/mist/scratch/logs/error_log'
/usr/local/bin/lockfile "$log.lock"
echo "${REMOTE_HOST:-$REMOTE_ADDR} [`date`] $REDIRECT_URL $HTTP_REFERER" >> $log
rm -f $log.lock

The log file now contains lines like:

The URLs beginning with /~mist/ are mine, and should generate
404 errors.  The others should also generate 404 errors, but I don't
see why my ErrorDocument is handling them.

Unfortunately I have not been able to reproduce this fault.  Our server
handles almost 25,000 404 errors a week, and my script would seem to be
handling about 100 of those.  It does seem to be handling all of my 404
errors.

The problem may be something to do with cgiwrap but this has not been 
changed recently.  Maybe some weird interaction between the two?
>How-To-Repeat:
Problem occurs intermittently.

The ErrorDocument script can be activated correctly with a URL like

Thanks for using Apache!
