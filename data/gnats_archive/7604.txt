>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP6
>Description:
Apache 1.3.9 (and these before) allowes to define variable like:

<!-- #set var="autors"  value=" (C) <a href=MailTo:eko@lanet.lv>eko@lanet.lv</a>" -->

and to place it with

<!-- #echo var="autors" -->

The result was hyperlink for sending mail.

In Apache 1.3.17 and Apache 1.3.19 (I have not tested versions between
1.3.9 and 1.3.17) the result is just text line with code!!!:

(C) <a href=MailTo:eko@lanet.lv>eko@lanet.lv</a>

Symbols '<' and '>' were replaced with '&lt;' and '&gt;' (without quotes).
>How-To-Repeat:
Create and insert such variables

 The last sentence in the problem report is displaied incorrectly. It should be:
 
 Symbols '<' and '>' were replaced with '&amp;lt;' and '&amp;gt;' (without quotes).
