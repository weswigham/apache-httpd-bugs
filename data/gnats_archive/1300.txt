>Description:
Server generates an "internal Server Error" randomly while executing 
perl scripts.

$req = new CGI::Request;

It does not create $req.

When we try to refer this object, an error mesage 'Can't 
call method "param" without a package or object 
reference at common.pl' is printed in the server log.

State-Changed-Why:
This is an error in your CGI script; it is the one that
is printing the error message to your log.  It has nothing
to do with Apache; you need to make your CGI script work.
You should read the documentation for the perl package
you are trying to use to figure out what you are doing
wrong.

 That is still most likely due to a bug in your CGI.  Apache is more
 advanced than Netscape's server in several ways so it makes flaws in CGIs
 more apparent.
 
 The error in your logs is being output straight from your perl script, so
 there is no way Apache can cause that.  You may have environment variables
 or something configured differently on the other server or, if it is a
 physically different box, you likely don't have the same perl modules
 installed on this one.  
 
 If you can't run it from the command line without getting errors from
 perl, you won't be able to run it from any server.

 When I run my appn from the command line, it runs successfully!
 Are there any environment varibales that I should check for?
