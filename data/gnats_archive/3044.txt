State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Sep 22 12:13:36 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The proper way to do this is to have Apache remove the PID
on shutdown so that when apachectl isn't used it will still
work properly.

This has already been committed and will be in 1.3.2.
