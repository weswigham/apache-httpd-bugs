 I'd guess that Linux 1.1.59 is too old for some of the features that
 Apache requires.  Have you had success with any earlier versions of
 Apache?  You can find them in the "old" subdirectory of the distribution
 site.

 No I had no experience with old versions.  This is the first time I'm
 trying apache. Thank you for your hint. I will try with an older
 version.
 
 Thanks again,
