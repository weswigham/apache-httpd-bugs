State-Changed-Why:
This appears to be a followup to a private discussion, or
to another report that I cannot find.  Since it is a
dissociated fragment, I'm closing it with the assumption
that resolution occurred out of band.

Yes, you're right about that. However, this is not the essence of the
problem. 

The right conclusion here is that the password matching *only* works for
passwords consisting of an empty string. In all other cases, the
matching fails with a "password mismatch" error as a result. In short,
password matching does not work even though the passwords are stored in
plain text.

Cheers,
Magnus
