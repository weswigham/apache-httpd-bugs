>Environment:
mod_auth_db, Berkeley DB 2.3.16
Solaris 2.6
gcc 2.7.2.2
>Description:
mod_auth_db does not work properly with Berkeley DB 2.x API.  It requires the
file to be writable to be able to open it and even then, it does not find
the needed entries.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile mod_auth_db against a Berkeley 2.x version and then try to use
AuthDBUserFile
>Fix:
The following patches worked for me:

# diff mod_auth_db.c mod_auth_db.c.dist
158,160d157
<     memset(&d, '\0', sizeof(d));
<     memset(&q, '\0', sizeof(q));
<

<     if (db_open(auth_dbpwfile, DB_HASH, DB_RDONLY, 0664, NULL, NULL,  &f) != 0) {

State-Changed-Why:
Ops, you're correct. The DB support is broken.
I've verified the initial Berkeley-DB/2.x
support against the wrong manpages in the past: Under
FreeBSD the db manpage describes DB 1.x and
not 2.x. Your patch is correct and now comitted
for Apache 1.3.4. Thanks for your feedback.
