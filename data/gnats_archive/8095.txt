The last I heard, apxs did not work properly for Apache 2.0.  I have not tried to make it work
recently, and I won't have time to look at it until this weekend.  Could you please file a bug
in bugs.apache.org, and I will try to get it working sometime over the next few days.

Hi,
Does anybody knows why i'm getting this error:

[root@itchy-scratchy bin]# ./apachectl configtest
Syntax error on line 947 of /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'AddModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
[root@itchy-scratchy bin]# 

Thanks
Hany

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/apache2/modules

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

Comment-Added:
Changing the synopsis to something a little more
reasonable, since AddModule being gone is
not a bug.
Synopsis-Changed-From: Invalid command 'AddModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined
Synopsis-Changed-To: apxs doesn't work in 2.0
Synopsis-Changed-By: slive
Synopsis-Changed-When: Sat Jul 28 07:38:22 PDT 2001
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Sun Aug 26 19:51:59 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
I have successfully used APXS to build mod_webapp.c for
Jakarta, so I believe it is working correctly now.

Please let us know if you have any other problems.
