This problem is precompile so the compiler version is irrelevant.
I used patch v2.1 and patch v2.5 to attempt to apply the patches.
>Description:
The core_404_log_bug and server_error_filename patches for Apache v1.3.3
do not apply cleanly to a virgin copy of Apache v1.3.3.

When patching http_main.c with core_404_log_bug.txt (using FSF patch v2.5),
I get

The rejected patch can be apply with a -F 3 flag but you might want
check to see if you can apply the patches to a virgin distribution or
you might want to replace the current versions of the patches with
copies that do apply cleanly.

yeah we goofed... but with 1.3.4 out there I don't think
I'm going to go fix the patches.
