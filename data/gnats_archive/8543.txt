>Description:
The file apache_1.3.22-win32-src.msi exist in /dist/httpd. When I downloaded and installed it it did not detect TCP/IP during install. I uninstalled it and installed  apache_1.3.20-win32-src-r2.msi and had no problems. I uninstalled that and tried apache_1.3.22-win32-src.msi again and tcp/ip was still not detected. Finally I installed apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.msi and had no problems. Clearly apache_1.3.22-win32-src.msi was an old file that someone forgot to delete.
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove all binaries from /dist/httpd and only distribute them from /disp/httpd/binaries.
>Fix:
Remove apache_1.3.22-win32-src.msi from /dist/httpd. It is no longer supported in and case.

 Ted, this is not a problem for the files in /dist/httpd/binaries/win32. The
 MSI files in /dist/httpd are incorrectly built. See PRr#8543. My problem was
 with apache_1.3.22-win32-src.msi. However apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.msi  from
 /dist/httpd/binaries/win32 gives no problems.

A test install package was improperly transferred to the
