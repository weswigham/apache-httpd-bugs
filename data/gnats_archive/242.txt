Server-parsed html refuses to work. Documents containing SSI directives appear
normal but results from directives are blank (e.g. echo, printenv) or do not
run (e.g. exec).

Uh... I dunno... I could send you my Apache binaries and configuration files but
I'm not sure this can help. I had replies from two mailing lists stating that
I should report this as a bug, 'cause it works fine on FreeBSD and BSDi. One
person told me he has the same problem on DEC OSF/1, so...

     Victor, can you point me to an URL that's demonstrating this
     problem?  If you could also send me the source of the page in a
     mail message, that would be excellent, as well.  It needn't be a
     fancy or involved page; just a simple one that's exhibiting this
     misbehaviour..

     Thanx for the info (for the record, the page is at
     <http://www.usac.edu.gt/cgi-bin/pruebaserv.shtml>).
 
     This file actually a text file, not a script, correct?  It looks as
     though it's in your server's script directory, which could be the
     root of the problem; Apache does not support parsing of CGI output,
     and the location is probably causing it to apply script rules even
     though it's not a script file.  Try moving the file to another
     location and see if it works there; I'll research the rules applied.

State-Changed-Why:
Have you tried moving the file out of the /cgi-bin/
directory?  As noted in private mail, if this is
your ScriptAlias directory that's probably the problem.

State-Changed-Why:
Victor, have you tried rebuilding the server with the
more recent sources described in private mail?  (This is
to try to get rid of the compilation warnings, not the
SSI problems.)

State-Changed-Why:
No feedback.  ssi working for lots of other folks.  A problem
like this is frequently caused by the Options setting in the
access.conf file not having Includes in it.
