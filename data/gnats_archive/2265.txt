>Description:
I'm running a web server with virtual hosts using Server version Apache/1.2.5. and am having a problem with double authentication.

If for example I load http://websvr/cri/its/index.html I get authenticated, but then if I load the same page with the fully qualified domain name http://websvr.chromatic.com/cri/its/index.html I get authenticated a second time. Is there a way to prevent this?

(If I load http://websvr.chromatic.com/cri/its/index.html I get authenticated, then if I load http://websvr/cri/its/index.html the page loads fine without reauthenticating.)

My httpd.conf includes...

ServerName websvr.chromatic.com
 
<VirtualHost 172.16.10.14>
 
        ServerName      websvr.chromatic.com
        ServerAlias     websvr
        DocumentRoot    /opt/www/jumpgate
        ErrorLog        logs/websvr-error_log
        TransferLog     logs/websvr-access_log
 
</VirtualHost>

# Chromatic Restricted Doc Root
<Directory /opt/www/jumpgate/cri>
 
        AuthName        Chromatic Secure Web Server
        AuthType        Basic
        AuthUserFile    /etc/passwd.htaccess
        AuthGroupFile   /etc/group.htaccess
        AllowOverride   AuthConfig
 
        require group   engineering
 
</Directory>

(BTW, I have tried different browsers and have gotten the same results.)
 
Thanks in advance for any help,

State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Thu May 21 16:44:52 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

All clients should do this, because they can't know
that "websvr.chromatic.com" is the same as "websvr".

(If you upgrade to Apache 1.3 you may want to take
 a look at the new UseCanonicalName directive.
 If set to 'off' Apache always uses the name from
 the Host-Header when generating self-referencing
 HTTP redirects.)

 fyi.. We were able to solve our double authentication problem on virtual
 hosts by switching to name-based virtual addressing and using "redirect" to
 redirect queries to the fully-qualified domain name...
