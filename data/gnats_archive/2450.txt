BIND: 8.1.1
>Description:
Logging of hostnames and IP addresses often truncates the hostname or the
IP address to the string up until the first dot.  Subsequent hits from
the same client usually results in the full hostname and/or IP address being
logged.  This also affects CGI variables REMOTE_HOST and REMOTE_ADDRESS, so
it isn't strictly a logging bug.  This behavior is seen approximately 15-20%
of the first hit from a particular client.  It is rarely seen on subsequent
hits from the same client.  This behavior was not seen on any Apache of the
1.2.x series on the same hardware/compiler/etc.

I don't believe it is a BIND problem as the IP address can also get truncated,
and the IP address is known directly by Apache.  A WAG is that the bug is in
mod_usertrack since it uses the address up to the first dot in generating the
cookie.

Here are some log examples showing the problem (LogFormat is %h %l %u %t 
\"%r\" %s %b \"%{User-agent}i\" %{Referer}i %{cookie}n):
