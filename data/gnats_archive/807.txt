>Environment:
Apache 1.1.1 and 1.2.0 on all platforms that I've seen so far
>Description:
mod_imap.c requires, for example

rect /url.html 10,20 30,40

whereas some web authoring tools (like Microsoft Frontpage) generate map files which have

rect /url.hrm 10 20 30 40

I have also pointed this out in a Frontpage bug report to Microsoft, to which I have received no response after quite some time...
>How-To-Repeat:
Very simply by writing map files with the two different formats above
>Fix:
Apache 1.2.0 mod_imap.c line 715

Change
sscanf(string_pos, "%lf, %lf",
to
sscanf(string_pos, "%lf%*[, ]%lf",
%0
