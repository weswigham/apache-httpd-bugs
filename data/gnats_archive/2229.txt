>Environment:
SunOS cnd-c 5.6 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20

gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
About 5% of the access log are entries like this:

152 - - [13/May/1998:18:06:08 -0700] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 8432
146 - - [13/May/1998:18:06:14 -0700] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 8432

The first number appears to be the first octet of the IP address
(based on observation of established connections using netstat).

The relevant conf file entries:

HostnameLookups off
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/access_log common

Most of the log entries are perfectly normal like this:

131.216.18.124 - - [13/May/1998:18:18:14 -0700] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 8432
>How-To-Repeat:
URL is http://www.cnd.org/
But since only about 5% of the entries are problematic, I am not sure how
to repeat it. It does not appear to have a pattern in the IP number.
>Fix:
Nope. Sorry.

Comment-Added:

I'm maintaining several Solaris 2.6 boxes myself, but
I've never seen incomplete addresses (just checked
some hundred Mbytes of logfiles, but all contain
valid addresses).

State-Changed-Why:
I, too, just checked about 200 megabytes of old logfiles, from
both Solaris and FreeBSD platforms, and also didn't see this.
What name resolver are you using?  My guess at this point
is that your resolver is buggy.  I would suggest either
upgrading it (if it isn't recent), using bind 8.1 if you're
currently not, or if you are using bind 8.x, try going back to
4.x just to see if it makes a difference.  If there's still
no difference maybe one of your upstream DNS providers is
busted, but that seems unlikely.

A good way to test might be to log all IP addresses for now
and use the "logresolve" program to debug further.

 Try this patch.  mod_usertrack was corrupting the hostname.
