>Description:
I downloaded an extra module for Apache, installed it and
did "./configure" with the correct paramters. This worked fine,
but i weren't able to compile Apache with "make":

--------------------------------------------------------
===> src/modules/extra
gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DLINUX=2 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I../../lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED `../../apaci` mod_proxy_add_forward.c
rm -f libextra.a
ar cr libextra.a mod_proxy_add_forward.o
ranlib libextra.a
<=== src/modules/extra
<=== src/modules
gcc -c  -I./os/unix -I./include   -DLINUX=2 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I./lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED `./apaci` modules.c
modules.c:32: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
modules.c:65: parse error before `;'
modules.c:100: parse error before `;'

mail:/usr/local/apache_1.3.14 #
-------------------------------------------------------------

The corresponing line in modules.c is:
  &proxy_add_forward;^M_module,
(The carriage return is replaced by "^M")

The problem is: The downloaded file has CRLF line breaks.
This is no problem for the compiler, it compiles fine, but when
the src/Configure script of Apache tries to read the module
definition:

module MODULE_VAR_EXPORT proxy_add_forward_module;

the trailing carriage return is not stripped, because the
sed command strips only ";" with spaces and tabs following, not
with carriage returns following.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
With the following patch to src/Configure, everything after the
";" will be stripped, so the "modules.c" file will be created without
errors. (If there are side effects with stripping everything, maybe
it's possible to add the carriage return to the list of to be stripped
characters)

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: fanf
State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 26 15:03:47 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
To be pedantic, this is a bug in the downloaded file, not in Apache.
2.0 has a different configuration system and 1.3 is in maintenance mode,
so I'm afraid we won't include your work-around.
Thanks for using Apache!
