Immunix 6.2 (redhat lookalike), Kernel 2.2.19 plus some patches (eg. Freeswan, OpenWall),
>Description:
I am using apache  1.3.20 as general proxy to access the internet.
Now I have an axis webcam server, which delivers a server side push of jpeg
images. Watching it with a web browser (Netscape 4.77/Linux) it works. However,
after I close the page in netscape, and even the whole netscape client, the
proxy keeps on downloading the data stream, using up valuable bandwidth.
I havent found a way to stop this short of restarting httpd.

I have tried setting CacheForceCompletion to 100, and even disabling the cache
alltogether (#'ing the relevant directives in httpd.conf)

stracing httpd yields the following results:

read(4, ".....<binary data>)
writev(3," ....<binary data>) 
read(4, "<binary data>")
writev(3,"binary data")       # this repeats, until I close the client window, then:

read(4, "<binary data>")
writev(3, "... binary data") = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)
--- SIGPIPE (Datenübergabe unterbrochen (broken pipe)) ---   #German locale
after which the process continues:
read(4, "<binary data>")
read(4, "<binary data>")
read(4, "<binary data>")
read(4, "<binary data>")
(ad infinitum)

I thus take it  not to be a client problem, since Apache is told that
the connection went down.
>How-To-Repeat:
This may be tricky. I am not directly aware if any publically available axis
servers are around. If needed, on Request, I could provide access to our server.
>Fix:
Sorry, no. I have worked around the problem by disabling the streaming on
the server for now.

finally timed out and free form text search link is broken. Sorry if the bug
has already been reported earlier.
