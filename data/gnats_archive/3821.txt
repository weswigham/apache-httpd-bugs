>Description:
This hasn't caused me any problems, but I just noticed something I think looks
fishy.

order array is defined to be METHODS long (15), yet when we come into 
check_dir_access for an M_INVALID (31) request, we're reading memory we're 
not supposed to.

This problem might give access voilation errors if not for our memory pools, 
and such. 
I doubt it's a security problem, but access permissions seem to be "random"
for M_INVALID.
>How-To-Repeat:
it's in the code.
>Fix:
check for M_INVALID in check_dir_access.
