>Environment:
AIX 4.1.4
C for AIX or gcc 2.7.0
>Description:
When including mod_rewrite in the configuration, it tries to use flock for
locking, which requires the BSD compatibility library (and is a limited
version of the function) instead of fcntl (from libc).  The linker returns
an undefined symbol error:

    ld: 0711-317 ERROR: Undefined symbol: .flock
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Possibilities include adding "#define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT" to the AIX
section of conf.h or "-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT" to EXTRA_CFLAGS in
Configuration, or adding "-lbsd" to EXTRA_LIBS in Configuration
