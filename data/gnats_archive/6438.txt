>Description:
Im running several VHosts, and when i Use an SSI page to #exec cgi from a vhost it cannot and will not find the correct CGI-BIN. Undefined CGI is all it reports in error log, however if i use the FULL path such as www.domain.com/bs/counter.html WORKS, however vhost bs.domain.com/counter.html DOES NOT work. I have ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /http/bs/cgi-bin/
And i also have tried adding <Directory /http/bs>Options All  Allowoverride All </Directory> in the vhost setup. 
Like i said it works on the docroot domain, but its almost like thier is a bug in SSI where it doesnt see the correct CGI-Bin, ive also tried copying the .cgi to the docroot cgi-bin dir
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.bomb.net/bs/counter.html
http://bs.bomb.net/counter.html
in counter.html i have <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/counter.cgi" -->
Also i also have it set to parse .html as well as .shtml
i have a script alias setup for bs.bomb.net (ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /http/bs/cgi-bin)
>Fix:
i dont know programming of any sort, but im sure once you look at this youll understand it.

State-Changed-Why:
If I try to access http://bs.bomb.net/cgi-bin/counter.cgi from
a web browser, it requires authentication.  Since the subrequest
has no authentication nor any way of requesting any, obviously
it fails.
