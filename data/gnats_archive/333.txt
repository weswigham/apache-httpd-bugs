AIX 4.2 native compiler
>Description:
I have to comment out line 155 of file conf.h:
typedef int rlim_t;
in order to get the server compiled. If I do not comment it out, I get the error
        cc -c   -O2 -DAIX -U__STR__   alloc.c
"/usr/include/sys/resource.h", line 70.17: 1506-334 (S) Identifier rlim_t has already been defined on line 155 of "conf.h".

 This should be able to be checked by parsing the output of
 /usr/bin/oslevel, if it exists.  If not, then it is < v4.x.  Otherwise, it
 returns something in the form:
 	
 	4.1.4.0
 
 (with no whitespace at the start)  4.1 needs the typedef, apparently 4.2
 doesn't.  Have access to a 4.1.4 box, no 4.2.

State-Changed-Why:
Valid problem, need to add special case code to detect 
versions of AIX that have rlim_t vs. those that don't.
