Apache 2.0.28 and 2.0.29-dev from CVS on 29-Nov-2001.
>Description:
If I use Port in my config Apache argues, that the Port directive isn't supported anymore. So I just use the Listen directive to set my Apache to run on port 8042. But if output the CGI environment variable SERVER_PORT via the SSI command #echo var="SERVER_PORT", I still get the "80" which was set via ./configure and AFAIK has been compiled into the apache httpd binary.
>How-To-Repeat:
See the example and footer on http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/.
The sources of these SSI pages are also available there. See the bottom of the mentioned pages.
[If the host is down, try cip117 instead of xcip3.]
>Fix:
IMHO the value of SERVER_PORT should be set to the Port which the acutal request came in and not to some configured "default" value. Perhaps there should be a second CGI environment variable called "DEFAULT_PORT" or "SERVER_PORT_DEFAULT" which results in the default port (probably the first parameter to Listen in the vhost config section).

State-Changed-Why:

This functionality is now combined in the ServerName
directive, which can take both a hostname and Port.
See
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/upgrading.html
for more details about changes from 1.3.

Of course, this still won't set SERVER_PORT to the port that the request came in on, unless you set
UseCanonicalName off
or the request comes on the same port as ServerName uses.
This hasn't changed from 1.3, and it is necessary to keep it that way so that cgi scripts have access to the appropriate port for use in redirects.

Perhaps having a REAL_PORT (or whatever) would be nice, although I'm not sure how useful.  If you want to suggest that, please open a new bug report.

Thanks.
