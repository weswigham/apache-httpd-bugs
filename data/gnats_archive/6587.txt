>Description:
Please apply the MPE portability patch for 1.3.13-dev that was posted to new-httpd on 9/22.  I've seen no reply to my posting yet, which suggests it has been lost in the noise.

FWIW I posted this same patch previously on 5/30 and it was also lost in the noise back then.  Now that rolling 1.3.13 was discussed briefly last week, I'm trying again to get the MPE port updated.

Thanks!
