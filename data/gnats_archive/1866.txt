1.3b3 pre-compiled win32 (windows NT4) downloaded 2 hrs ago from apache.org

[Tue Feb 24 17:12:30 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: c:/web/cgi-bin/emms.cgi
The file definitely exists, it can be run from the commandline, and if changed to .exe works fine.
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi has been added to srm.conf

Unfortunately this is on an intranet behind more firewalls than the pentagon. If I could help on that I would. Sorry.

umm, no idea sorry. It does appear identical to an error under OS/2 (error report 59%2

State-Changed-Why:
Is it an interpted script?  If so, do you have a line
of the form:

#!/path/to/interpreter.exe

as the first line of the script, where that specifies
the path to the interpreter used?

 Nope, its an executable, written in C++.

State-Changed-Why:
I believe this has been fixed in 1.3b5; it now works fine
for me.  Try it when a binary release of b5 or later
is available and let us know if it still doesn't work.
