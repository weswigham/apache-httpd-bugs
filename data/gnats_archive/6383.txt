>Description:
Further to PR#4858, does anyone know any fix can solve the problem (i.e. group definition size cannot greater than 8K byte, otherwise users that outside 8Kbytes cannot access apache)?  I am using v.1.3.6.  Many thanks for help.

State-Changed-Why:

Use the mod_auth_dbm.  You need to be doing this anyway if
your group list (and therefore your user list) is getting
this large.

Apache 1.3.13-dev in the current development tree supports
mod_auth_dbm for Win32 using the SDBM library, which is
also now included.  Grab the current tree from dev.apache.org
or wait for the official release for binaries.

You will need to use the dbmmanage utility to work with the
SDBM users file.  A new, extra argument in the command
dbmmanage usersdb adduser file p/w group
will let you add a list of groups (comma seperated, no
spaces) so groups are organized by user, rather than users
by group.
