Apache 1.3.4 on OS/2
>Description:
Apache 1.3.4 works quite well on OS/2 here as a proxy server. We have
used CERN derivates until now (Lotus Go and Domino) that provided the "Pass"
and "Fail" configuration directives. Using these, it was possible to configure
the proxy so that certain URL types (such as "ftp:*") or certain URL
patterns (such as "http:*.zip") could be blocked from being retrieved over
that proxy ("Fail ftp:*" and "Fail http:*.zip" and so on).

I cannot find a equivalent configuration directive for Apache. How is something
like that done? I would like to be able to block our proxy users from
downloading files over that proxy at least to some degree (bandwidth issues).

State-Changed-Why:
You can simply use the normal access control directives
in Apache, in a slightly special form as they apply to
mod_proxy.  Please read the mod_proxy docs at
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_proxy.html for details.

It would really be appreciated if you could, as we ask
before you submit a bug report, take support questions up
in other more appropriate forums first instead of immediately
filing a bug report.

Thanks.
