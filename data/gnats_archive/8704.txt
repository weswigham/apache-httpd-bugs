>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
SunOS 5.7, gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
>Description:
We are using Apache to serve images on port 2270, and Weblogic to serve jsp on port 80. In the jsp, links to images point to Apache (img src="http://www.galls.com:2270/images/products/somefile.jpg"). Frequently, but not every time, a page will render with all requested images except for one. In IE, right-clicking on the image and selecting Show Picture displays the image. While this is listed as an issue with IE 5 and 5.5 sp1, it is listed as fixed in IE 5.5 sp2. However, I am running IE 5.5 sp2 and still have this problem. This has also been observed in older version of IE 4 - 5.5 sp1.
