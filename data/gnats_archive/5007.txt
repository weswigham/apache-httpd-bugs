>Description:
I have been trying to implement the ScriptLog directive of mod_cgi and am having difficulty.  The apache child procs can create the file and appear to be trying writing to it (traced the processes) but doesn't manage to write anything.  I have included the section of the trace where the child id trying to open the file and write the contents of the 500 error to it.  The file is writeable globally is in /tmp and owner/group of the child processes.

Here's the relevant part of the trace :-
