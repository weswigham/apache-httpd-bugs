>Description:
For the suitably paranoid, it's a bad thing (tm) that current distribution of
the Apache source does not have a publically available PGP Public Key that is
associated with it (ie. looking up key A0BB71C1 fails on any public key server).

The point of this is that, if we're really worried about source tampering on the
Apache FTP site it is conceivable that the keyfiles and signatures out there are
also prone to the same problem - put simply, if the source file on one machine
is tampered with on a given machine it's pretty reasonable to assume that the
keyfile/sigs will also be modified (ie. tampered with) therefore nullifying the
usefullness of the information they are designed to protect.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try looking up the keys on a Public Key Server (http://pgp.mit.edu/)
>Fix:
Register the keys officially (see http://pgp.mit.edu/)

State-Changed-Why:
The current contents of the KEYS file have been submitted
to the MIT and PGP.Com key servers (though the latter
seems to be ignoring some of them).

Since anyone can do this, the exposure actually seems
quite minimal.  There's no proof that the keys on the
server came from the named entities any more than there
is because they're in the KEYS file.

Thanks for taking the time to report this, and for using
Apache!
