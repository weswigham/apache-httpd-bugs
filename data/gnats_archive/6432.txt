Windows NT4 sp6 pre-built 1.3.12 images from Apache mirror.
>Description:
Identical to problem described in PR number 4893 (but I cannot
seem to add to that problem report, sorry):
Under Win32 1.3.12 apache, CGI programs can never do server push,
regardless of whether they are "nph-" CGI programs.  Apache
will always buffer the output of the CGI program into
huge (IOBUFSIZE) chunks.  Specifically, Apache will buffer
the output in the BUFF object that represents the connection
back to the client browser.

The reason for this can be found in http_protocol.c
in ap_send_fb_length().  The code has the general 
structure of:

  while (1)
    { 
    while (1) 
      {
      nread = read stuff from CGI using ap_bread();
      if (nread > 0)
        break;
      // nread==0: XXX NEVER HAPPENS ON WINDOWS
      flush BUFF that goes to browser using ap_bflush();
      call select() to wait until data arrives;
      }
    write nread bytes to the browser
  }

the code therefore assumes that ap_bread() will return
if no data is avaialble.  unfortunately, on win32, 
the connection to the CGI program is a Win32 Pipe,
and as documented in ReadFile, a Win32 pipe does
not return at all until some data arrives (or there
are no pipe writers).

therefore, the code path marked XXX above never happens
on windows, and we pretty much never flush the output
to the client browser (unless we actually reach
IOBUFSIZE bytes of output).
>How-To-Repeat:
any server push CGI program will do.  example:

#!g:\slave\tcsh.exe
echo 'Connection: close'
echo 'Content-type: text/html'
echo 'cache-control: private, no-store, no-cache'
echo 'Expires: Tue, 23 Jun 1998 01:01:01 GMT'
echo 'PRAGMA: NO-CHACHE'
echo ''
echo 'testing<P>'
./sleep 1
echo 'testing 2<P>'
./sleep 1
echo 'testing 3<P>'
./sleep 1
echo 'testing 4<P>'
./sleep 1
echo 'testing 5<P>'
./sleep 1
echo 'testing 6<P>'

notice that all the numbers come out at once.
>Fix:

yup.  this is one way.  not the best performance
but it works.  one optimization may be to only do
this when processing a CGI program (would need to pass
that down).  another optimization may be to pre-test
the need for a flush by using the Win32 PeekNamedPipe()
function, which purports to return total bytes currently
available.  The NT documentation on anonymous pipes
claims that the named pipe functions should work on 
anonymous pipes, but I have not tried it.  I hope this
helps you.
