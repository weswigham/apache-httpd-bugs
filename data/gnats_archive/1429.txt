I've seen in your known bugs report that when I received the message POST not support
for this URL it was necessary to modify a configuration file to enter:
limit GET POST
I've not been able to locate in which Apache configuration File I have to do the
change. Can you help me?

Many thanks

[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.

Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!
