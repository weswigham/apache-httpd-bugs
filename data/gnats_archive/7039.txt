>Description:
Record from /var/log/httpd/access_log
[07/Jan/2001:21:34:29 +1100] "GET /english HTTP/1.1" 301 321 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 95)"

It seems the problem may be similar to what has been recorded for MSIE 4.b02 and below.

State-Changed-Why:

I can't tell at all what you are trying to say here.
What is it that doesn't work?  What is the exact
configuration that generates it?  What is
the contents of the error log?

If you are saying that Apache does not follow 
symbolic links, then you should look at the
documentation for the Options directive.

In any case, this question looks more approrpriate
for the newsgroup:
news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
than for the bug database.
