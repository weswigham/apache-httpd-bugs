1.3.6 - The Apache.org shipped binary for Win32 disallows all authentication using mod_auth, and the server error log signifies that crypt() is not available for Win32 systems.

Error as follows:

http://equities.barchart.com/adv/cbuilder/launch.htm
>Fix:
go back to no crypting, as in previous win32 releases.
