SunOS yarra-glen 5.5.1 Generic_103640-03 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10

I.e. Solaris 2.5.
No patches.
>Description:
If the SOCKS4 rule is invoked when using Configure under Solaris, -lresolv
is added to the list of libraries before -lsocks. This results in two
symbols which are defined in libresolv.a not being resolved by libsocks.a.
>How-To-Repeat:
Trivial
>Fix:
Easy - move the three lines

    if [ "$OS" = "Solaris 2" ]; then
        LIBS="$LIBS -lresolv"  
    fi  

from above to underneath the SOCKS test
