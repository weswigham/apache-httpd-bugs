OS: FreeBSD 2.2.7
>Description:
The access-logging of a virtual server stopped after 5 days of work.
Meanwhile, the http daemon continued to work flawlessly and served
correctly all virtual hosts, also the one for which no more access logging was done.
Logging restarted after a stop and start.
The access logs size was about 10.2MB when it had stopped. 
There are no quota limits and the processes are allowed to have much huger files.
