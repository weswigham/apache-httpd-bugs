>Description:
In certain pages on my website, running on windows xp, the page has problems displaying, and the way these happen depends from person to person.

The most common problem is that the page loads about halfway, then stops, and starts to reload, continuing in a neverending cycle. For some users, the page does not display at all, and for others the page loads halfwaw, resulting in incomplete html source being spouted out onto the page.

Bizarrely, this only seems to affect two areas of my site, http://www.watah.com/guestbook and http://www.watah.com/html ; other pages such as the root page display with no problems.
>How-To-Repeat:
- http://www.watah.com/guestbook : incomplete source on page
- http://www.watah.com/html : either doesn't display or reloads randomly
- http://www.watah.com : root, works fine by comparison.
