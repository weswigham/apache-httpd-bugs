>Environment:
Linux 2.0.35 ( upgraded RedHat 5.1 ) with jdk-1.1.7a using green threads
>Description:
The client simply sits there, no response is ever returned.  The log just seemed to show that the servlet engine was 'Reading request data' then hang.
>How-To-Repeat:
I had this on a 'production' machine, so I had to simply go back to the 19981015 release I have been running till now.  I am setting up another machine in a very similar fashion to see if I can repro this somewhere where it can be looked at.  I will be willing to work with anyone who wishes to try and resolve this by providing any sort of extra information they want, running any sort of test programs, and perhaps even allowing access to the machine to check somethings out for themselves.
