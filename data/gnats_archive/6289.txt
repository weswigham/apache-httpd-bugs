Windows NT 4.0 UK - Service Pack 5
>Description:

Maybe its just my inexperience, but the Windows NT OS does not seem to allow me to create filenames like .htaccess, which have nothing before the dot, and more than three characters after the dot. Since almost all of the documentation is centred around the *nix platform, I was unable to find in the documentation how to do this on the Windows NT platform. Since NTFS is a posix compliant filesystem, I thought I should be able to create these kind of files on our NTFS partitions? I seem to be unable to create them.

>How-To-Repeat:

Start the Windows Explorer, go to a directory, right-click your mouse, select NEW-TEXT DOCUMENT, and try to name it .htaccess ...
>Fix:

Make the Windows NT OS allow .htaccess filenames ;)
Maybe you could allow the admin to specify the names of all the other config files in the global configuration file, like 
.htaccess = htaccess.txt or something like that ...

State-Changed-Why:

Yes, some win32 programs incorrectly refuse to allow you to
save a file named .bleh - just try creating a new notepad
file and save as .bleh - and it will fail.

However, start notepad with the filename .bleh and it will
ask you if you would like to create it, and save it without
any argument.

If this is frustrating, the AccessFileName directive lets
you use some other meaningful name (such as htaccess.ctl
or whatever you choose.)

Tagged as analyzed till we can toss the answer in the FAQ.

Thanks for your interest in the Apache project.
