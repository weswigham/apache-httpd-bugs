un-important -- it's higher level than OS
>Description:
This is just a bug in the test-cgi script that's distributed with your server.
I occurs when you simply append " *" or something like that to the end of a
server that has the test-cgi script viewable to the public.  It allows the
remote user to list any files on the remote system that the user running
test-cgi can list (i guess it runs as nobody, normally).  This is bad.

I'm sure you don't recommend that people keep that script on their site -- but
at the same time, it's not good to introduce security holes if they do so.
>How-To-Repeat:
"http://web.foo.com/cgi-bin/test-cgi /*"
>Fix:
just put quotes around the $SERVER_PROTOCOL variable in the script... it might 
be an idea to put quotes around all the variables, so that silly problems like
this don't pop up again.

State-Changed-Why:
What OS are you using?

Are you sure you aren't using an old copy of test-cgi?

The version distributed with Apache is _NOT_ vulnerable to
this problem unless you use a very broken shell.  Note the:

# disable filename globbing
set -f

line.

 Hey, sorry about that.  I'm mistaken.  I downloaded the tar/gziped 
 source this morning to make sure the bug still existed, without actually 
 trying the script.  I looked for quotes, and saw none, not thinking that 
 a more robust solution might have been implemented.  The test-cgi script 
 I use on my home box is indeed very old.
 
 I'm not that familiar with this PR system, so maybe if you could close 
 this for me...
 
   sorry again, Reuben
