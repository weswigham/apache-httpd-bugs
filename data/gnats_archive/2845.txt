OS: AIX 4.3.1 and AIX 4.2.1 (same problem with these two different OS)
COMPILER: IBM C Set ++ for AIX
>Description:
cc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DAIX=43 -U__STR__ -qnogenpcomp

"os-aix-dso.c", line 133.12: 1506-343 (S) Redeclaration of dlerror differs from 
previous declaration on line 57 of "/usr/include/dlfcn.h".                      
"os-aix-dso.c", line 133.12: 1506-050 (I) Return type "const unsigned char*" in 
redeclaration is not compatible with the previous return type "unsigned char*". 
make: The error code from the last command is 1.


During the configuration, I received this message 4 times:
egrep: Maximum line length of 2048 exceeded.

[./configure --enable-module=status --enable-module=info --enable-module=speling --enable-module=rewrite --enable-module=auth_anon --enable-module=digest --enable-module=expires --enable-module=headers --enable-module=usertrack]

I'm currently running 1.3.0 with no problem during the compilation.
Could you check this? I'm not a programmer so I cannot help you, But I can give you access to the lib you will need...
