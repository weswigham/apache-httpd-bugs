>Description:
When using a single IP address to several virtual hosts (using NameVirtualHost IP), I've noticed that the apache daemon must resolve all the virtualhosts con-
figured on the <VirtualHost www.example.com> section.

If nameservers are unavailable at the time, the server will always consider the
remaining virtualhosts as the default one.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just configure the virtualhosts as explained above and run the apache daemon
with the nameserver specified on the resolv.conf down.
>Fix:
Does the daemon really needs to resolve that hosts?
