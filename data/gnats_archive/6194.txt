>Description:
Hi, I think apache is the best web server all over the world.
2.04a add some good features which I expect for a long time. 
The multithread is I needed. But When I compiled is using the
following command : 
1. "src/configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --with-mpmt=mpmt_pthread --enable-modules=proxy"
2. "src/configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=proxy"
3. "src/configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-modules=proxy"
4. "src/configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --with-module=/src/modules/proxy"
 
none of the above can add proxy modules in apache. I use the second command
is good in apache 1.3.12

I use "./httpd -l" and "vi src/modules.c" and never find proxy.

by the way, the apache 2.04a provide severel multithread motheds but the readme
is too simple and don't tell me the differece between them, especially for unix platform.

And I find the other problem. 
When I start apache it tell me the ScoreBoardFile is not created, But I started
with root privileg.
The third is that there is the "apachectl" command in "bin" directory

State-Changed-By: rbbloom@us.ibm.com
State-Changed-When: Thu Jun 15 07:30:58 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Mod_proxy is not available with 2.0a4.  There has been a first
cut at the proxy introduced this week and it will be available
with the 2.0a5.

The docs are being flushed out still, but they will be ready
when we release the final version of 2.0.  The same thing goes
for apachectl.  As this is a developers release, we do not
provide all of the helpers scripts that will be available with
the final version.

Thank you for your feedback.
