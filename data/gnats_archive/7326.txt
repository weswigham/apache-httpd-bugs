 Hello,
 
 I have a problem starting up the apache.  The following is the error
 message:
 
 # /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
 Syntax error on line 211 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
 Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_negotiation.so into server: ld.so.1: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_negotiation.so: symbol __floatdisf: referenced symbol not found
 /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started
 #
 
 The symbol __floatdisf is part of the gcc libc src in file quad.h and c source
 floatdisf.c.  Referance http://reactor-core.org/~ejb/44bsd-cvs/bsd-i386/lib/libc/quad/  
 
 Any idea how could I remove this error.  The apache compiled without warnings orerrors.  The comment in PR number 7326 is not very helpful.  I would like
 to know how was it solved.
 
 I am using Solaris 2.8 with gcc 2.95.2 and gcc 3.0.  I did use two different 
 versions of the gcc compilers but without success.
