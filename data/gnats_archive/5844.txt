NT 4 SP 5 and Windows 2000 Professional
Visual C++ 6 SP3
Apache 1.3.9
Apache 1.3.12
>Description:
 I have installed the latest release 1.3.12 on Windows 2000. I would
like to enable mod_info so I compile this module integrate it in my
configuration file. And when I want to use my server info URL
"http://localhost/server-info". I got a GPF I try in debug mode to find
the error. The error seems to be in the mod_info.c.


I have try to compile using makefile and VC++ project and I got the same
problem.


>How-To-Repeat:
Simply using the following to get server-info on your httpd
>Fix:
-  several global variables a NULL when the procedure try to retrieve
informations about the web browser in the function  'display_info' at
line 359.
  Here you can find the NULL variables:
    ap_user_name
    ap_user_id
    ap_group_id
    ap_pid_fname
    ap_server_confname

 - When it try to retrieve information about the different modules the
'modp' variable is NULL.
