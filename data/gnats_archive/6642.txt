>Description:
Neither rotatelogs nor cronolog works. The logs files are never created or written.

See httpd.conf:
<VirtualHost 64.37.86.33>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@varel.ch
        DocumentRoot /data/domains/varel.ch/web/docs
        ServerName varel.ch
        ErrorLog /data/domains/varel.ch/web/logs/error.log
        #TransferLog "|./cronolog /data/domains/varel.ch/web/logs/access/%Y-%W.log"
        TransferLog "|./rotatelogs /data/domains/varel.ch/web/logs/access/log 86400"
        <Directory /data/domains/varel.ch/web/docs>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
>How-To-Repeat:
see httpd.conf above.

No.

State-Changed-Why:
I have just committed a patch to fix piped logs.  There were
a couple of bugs introduced that broke this, but I believe
they are all fixed now.  This patch is available in HEAD
from CVS, and will be available in the next Apache 2.0 alpha.

Thank you for using Apache.
