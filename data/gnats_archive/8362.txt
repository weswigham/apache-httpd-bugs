 How-To-Repeat:
 1) You need to redirect 404s to a 404 document:
 ErrorDocument 404 /404.shtml
 2) You need be doing parsing of that file:
 AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
 3) You need to send it a request like:
 http://server.org/test%2fing
 
 Reproduced on:
 Apache 1.3.20 Linux 2.4.9
 Apache 1.3.11 Solaris 1.3.11 and 1.3.3

 Dr.Watson for Windows NT
 An application error has occureed and an application arror is being generated.
 Apache.exe
 Exeption: access violation(0xc0000005), Address: 0x6ff7b422 
 <<<
 
 Good thing:
 
 Apache continued to work an responded to any queries from Internet. :)
 
 Bad thing:
 
 Computers memory is fullfiled with Dr.Watson's error messages :(
 
 There was no such kind of problem before Nimda worm.
 It's very likely, that the problem is in
 Customizable error response, SSI and amount of wrong queries from Internet:
 
 Customizable error response (Apache style) - local redirects is activated:
 
 ErrorDocument 403 /system/errordocs/403.shtml
 ErrorDocument 404 /system/errordocs/404.shtml
 ErrorDocument 500 /system/errordocs/500.shtml
 
 The Dr.Watson error messages did not appear any more, after
 local redirects have been turned off and other error response activated:
 
 ErrorDocument 403 "Ko meklee?
 ErrorDocument 404 "Nav atrodams!
 ErrorDocument 500 "Atstaajies!
 
 Here comes the content of 404.shtml:
