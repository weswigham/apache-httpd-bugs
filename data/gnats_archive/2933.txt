>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.2.7
>Description:
if you are trying to mirror a website (eg: replicate something outside
a firewall) you need a ProxyPass directive.  the one in the docs currently
is broken:

ProxyPass / http://foo.com

will only work for top level entries.  anything below it returns a "Host not
found" error from the proxy.  quite confusing.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
add a trailing slash:

ProxyPass / http://foo.com/

fixes it completely.

i can't believe i spent 30 minutes figuring that out!
