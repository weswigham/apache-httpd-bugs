This may not be a bug, I couldn't tell by looking at the code.
But is suspiciously looks like one

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr  1 15:41:16 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Actually the side-effect is deliberate.  Is there a way to
indicate to the SGI compiler that the side-effect is intended?
gcc will disable the warning if you put an extra () pair
around the assignment.

Thanks for reporting it though.
