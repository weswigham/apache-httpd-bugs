>Environment:
Redhat Linux 6.2 / Kernel 2.2.18 
>Description:
With a minimal httpd.conf ( see below) I want to turn on "FancyIndexing".

The following directives do work:

FancyIndexing on
 or
IndexOptions FancyIndexing

The following does NOT:

IndexOptions +FancyIndexing

When putting the not working directive into a <Directory>-Block 
it works however.
>How-To-Repeat:
Port 8080
ServerRoot /home/msuencks
DocumentRoot /home/msuencks
TypesConfig /etc/mime.types
PidFile httpd.pid
TransferLog httpd.access_log
ErrorLog httpd.error_log

# this worked
# FancyIndexing on
# IndexOptions FancyIndexing

# this didn't
IndexOptions +FancyIndexing

# to make it work i had to do:
# <Directory />
# IndexOptions +FancyIndexing
# </Directory>
