>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional Edition, with Apache 1.3.14 (Binary) running as a service.
>Description:
Apache 1.3.14 seems to not load virtual hosts when starting up as a service. If I attempt to do it manually I have no problem, but I have to restart the service manually after each system-reboot. I am not sure what could be causing this, because I tried with a new service that I installed telling it to load my httpd.conf file but it does not seem to make a difference.
