mod_speling
>Description:
A request for a mistyped filename, that ends with a slash,
is redirected to the correct file name, but still with a
trailing slash, eg
 /example.htm/ redirects to
 /example.html/ when example.html exists, and not to
 /example.html which might be expected, and which would be more useful

The second request for /example.html/ does NOT get redirected
to /example.html even though example.html exists as a file and not
as a directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.acornusers.org/index.htm/
(where index.html is the correct filename)
>Fix:
(1) Change mod_speling to notice and remove trailing slash if the name it
has suggested is a file.
(2) Match and redirect to files which are incorrectly accessed as directories.
