>Environment:
Solaris v2.5.1
Gcc v2.7.2
>Description:
If two domain names are registered in the httpd.conf file, say 
calvin.vwv.com and ftp.vwv.com. Both of these names have the same IP address.

The calvin.vwv.com address is the default address of the webserver. The 
ftp.vwv.com address is defined in a Listen directive.

When Apache starts, it responds with "Bind: Address already in use, could
not bind to 196.7.40.2 port 80"

It would seem that Apache does not detect whether it binds to the same address
twice, and post a suitable warning message.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Either include an error message, or remove the restriction to bind to 
two separate names with same IP address.

State-Changed-Why:
Hi Graham.  It's generally not necessary to use 
Listen IP:port
when port is the same IP number, since apache by
default will bind to every IP address on the default
port.  I bet if you remove that entry it will bind fine.
Please check out the vhost docs on apache.org; vhosting
was once simple but thanks to the vagarities of the HTTP
protocol it's not that easy.  Also, 1.3's support for
vhosts is (we think) a little clearer.

  Brian
