I made a clean modification to not log .gif and .jpg.
>Description:
After one two two hours only 3 childs are left. MinSpareServers is 20.
I drive a heavy load cgi-game. It worked around a year without problems. After using all i-nodes the starvation started.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't now, just can see it here.
>Fix:
No. But 1.1.3.seems to run without this problem

State-Changed-Why:
We've made many many changes in this area for the 1.2 release.
It wouldn't be feasible for us to back-port them to 1.1.  Since
you seem to be working with 1.1.3 I'm just going to close out
this ticket.  You could also try the 1.2b8 snapshot available
at our website.

Thanks for using Apache!
