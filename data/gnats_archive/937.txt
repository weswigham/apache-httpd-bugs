Solaris 2.5.1
Apache 1.2.0 - precompiled binaries
>Description:
I use Apache 1.2.0 for Solaris 2.5.1. Recently Microsoft announced "Web Server Extension" package to enable cooperation between MicroSoft's FrontPage HTML editor and a number of HTTP servers, including Apache. As a part of this package, MicroSoft ships a precompiled Apache 1.1.3 as well as a patch to allow the "ScriptAlias" directive in the Apache's srm.conf to support wildcards. My questions is: Has this patch already  been incorporated in Apache 1.2.0? If not, are there plans to do so and in which Apache version?
Thanx

State-Changed-Why:
No, their changes have not been integrated and there are
no plans to do so.  With 1.2 and later, it should be possible
to acomplish what they do using other directives, however
they need to change their setup for that.

We do not support the FrontPage extensions because the way
Microsoft recommends you use them is a huge gaping security
hole.

Note that, according to Microsoft, it is possible to run
the frontpage extensions without the patch.
