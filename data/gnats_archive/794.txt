>Description:
Assuming a directory without an index file and DirectoryIndex with about
5 different filenames on it - the page is also protected w/ a password. 

When attempting to retrieve: "...../thedir/", the server authenticates the userid
and password once for every file that is listed in DirectoryIndex even if the file
doesn't exist. 

It seems like the authentication should be performed only if the server is deciding
whether or not to send the file, not when it is trying to pick which one to display.

This isn't a big deal using htpasswd authentication, but if the authentication is 
expensive (authenticating to Kerberos/AFS over the network), it gets to be a little
too intensive.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I haven't looked at that portion of the code, but a simple fix would be, instead of

for each file
	check pass, if OK
		if file exists
			send first match

to

for each file
	if file exists
		check if pass ok, if ok
			send first match

That would eliminate some of the unnecessary checks. It wouldn't entirely solve it,
but it would help some

State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately the existance of the <Files> directive makes it
necessary to sometimes check auth for each sub request.  Each
file in the directory is a sub request when generating the index.
But the code tries to be smart and avoid doing auth unless a
<Files> section truly applied ... do you have any <Files>
sections?
