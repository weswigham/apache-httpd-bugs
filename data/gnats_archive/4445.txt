>Description:
apache: module ".\mod_jserv.c" is not compatible with this version of Apache.
Please contact the vendor for the correct version.
>How-To-Repeat:
Firstly I installed "apache_1_3_6_win32.exe". Then I tried to run the APACHE HTTP 
WEB SERVER. It worked fine. Then I needed servlet support so I went and installed
ApacheJServ1_0b2-Apche1_3_4.exe. I installed this by following the installation
guide.

I restarted the machine and then I tried to start APACHE Web Server to test my first 
Servlet I am getting the following error

"apache: module ".\mod_jserv.c" is not compatible with this version of Apache.
Please contact the vendor for the correct version."
