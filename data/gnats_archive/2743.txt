>Release:        1.3.1
>Environment:
Apache on Windows NT and Solaris 2.5.1+
>Description:
The http_config.c, line 546 there is a check for a MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER,
which has changed from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1.  Allaire ships a compiled shared object
module for its ColdFusion product. It has few dependancies and should generally work
with all 1.3.x versions.

I would request the the MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER *not* be changed for minor point
releases of Apache so we can ship binaries with out product that will work
even when Apache moves forward.

We are getting a lot of grief from our customers about this. :-)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to load a module built with 1.3.0 headers on 1.3.1
>Fix:
Freeze the MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER (in http_config.h) unless there really is an 
incompatible API change.
Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
You are correct that changing the MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER for
minor releases is inconvenient for module authors who ship
binary-only modules. This is why we do it as little as
possible; if you'll note, Apache 1.2.0 has the same
MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER as 1.2.6.

However, if you'll note (http://dev.apache.org/mmn.txt has
a list of some of the reasons MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER has been
changed), API changes has to be made for 1.3.1. These were
changes that should have been in 1.3.0, but we forgot.

Some of these, such as the renaming of functions, do affect
binary compatibility, and any module compiled for 1.3.0
that uses them would not work with 1.3.1. This is why the
MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER check exists.

However, we are aware of the problem. For now, we can only
suggest you produce a 1.3.1 version of your module and
reccomend your users upgrade to 1.3.1 (the Apache Group
reccomends this as well).

As well, it is a priority for Apache 2.0 to include a
mechanism for ensuring backwards-compatibility for modules
when we make API changes.

Thanks for using Apache.
