it is case by  "&lt;!--#include file="???.cgi"--&gt;".

exsample:
---[HTML source]---
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;!--#include file="test.cgi"--&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

---[CGI script]---
#!/bin/sh
echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
echo
echo 'abc'

#end of script
---
it was printed as "abc".
but I did think it is printed as 
"echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
 echo
 echo 'abc'".

:
include 
     This command inserts the text of another document or file into the parsed file. Any included file is subject to the usual access
     control. If the directory containing the parsed file has the Option IncludesNOEXEC set, and the including the document would
     cause a program to be executed, then it will not be included; this prevents the execution of CGI scripts. Otherwise CGI scripts
     are invoked as normal using the complete URL given in the command, including any query string.

State-Changed-Why:
If the CGI file would be allowed to be executed anyway,
ie. if it is called directly, then there is nothing to
gain by not letting it be called from a SSI.

What IncludesNOEXEC does is disable SSI commands that explicitly
execute something that wouldn't otherwise be executed.

 it isn't so!
 
 documentation is "If the directory containing the parsed file has
 the Option IncludesNOEXEC set, and the including the document would
 cause a program to be executed, then it will not be included;
 this prevents the execution of CGI scripts."
  
 I think.
 This case must not be executed the CGI by "#include" of element".
