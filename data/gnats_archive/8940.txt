>Environment:
Win32 Win2000SP2 VC++ 6.0 SP5
>Description:
When adding the command ISAPICacheFile to the configuration file, such as
ISAPICacheFile = "mydll.dll"

the dll gets loaded by the isapi_load method, and gets inserted into the cache.

Later on, the configuration gets unloaded, and the cleanup_isapi_server_config method is called; this method calls the isapi_unload method, which tries to call the TerminateExtension method of the ISAPI dll. However, the Dll is no longer in memory, as it has been unloaded by the dso_cleanup method, which gets registered when calling apr_dso_load.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add an ISAPICacheFile command
>Fix:
Do not use ISAPICacheFile
