>Description:
Uhm yes... well for very odd and obscure reasons we are doing a apachectl graceful every minut... :-) Don't ask.. hehe

Anyways.. this seems to be a problem... cause apache uses over 600meg of ram on a box we have.. although the problem goes away if we completely restart it...
or rather say stop abusing "apachectl graceful"
>How-To-Repeat:
Restart apachectl every minut and let it run for about 6 days? HUH ? :-)
>Fix:
Uhm does'nt seem like it? :-)
