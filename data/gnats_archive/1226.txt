>Environment:
SunOS hamster 5.5.1 ISS_1.0 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
We are running an Apache 1.2.4 server with A LOT (1500+) of VirtualHosts.  Every so often (most likely after a -HUP signal), the server seems to stop using the document roots specified within the <VirtualHost> blocks and start using the server's DocumentRoot instead.

i.e. We have a customer whose document root is /u3/s/o/someuser/public_html, but when we try to pull up their pages, Apache looks in /usr/local/www (the document root for the main server) instead:

[Thu Oct  2 01:55:27 1997] access to /usr/local/www//spotr.gif failed for 207.171.199.71, reason: File does not exist
[Thu Oct  2 01:55:27 1997] access to /usr/local/www//brwndog.gif failed for 207.171.199.71, reason: File does not exist

This is most likely an error with the httpd.conf parser.  Restarting the server seems to fix it.

>How-To-Repeat:
The problem is intermittent and difficult to reproduce.  It seems to happen about once a week.

Please provide input on how to further diagnose the problem when we catch the server in this state.

Please give more details about your configuration...

Are you using ip-based virtual hosts or name-based virtual hosts
or do you mix both in your config? In what order?

 So the name-based (IP-less) virtual hosts are specified using DNS names?
 Are there any errors in the error_log?  You can specify them by IP as well
 -- just put the IP on which they're normally supposed to respond... so
 you'll have a whole bunch with the same IP, but that's fine.  The
 <VirtualHost> directive defines what IP address a host exists on.
 
 We've also rewritten this code in 1.3.

State-Changed-Why:

As far as I remember the problem was resolved by using
IP-addresses instead FQDNs in the <VirtualHost> directives
to avoid DNS lookups on startup.
