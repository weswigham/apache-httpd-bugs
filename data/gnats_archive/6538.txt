>Description:
We use Novell Groupwise 5.5 enhancement pack Webaccess running on a Netware
platform with Apache webserver 3.1 runing on a Unix box. The problem is that all 
attachments sent via Webaccess get truncated and corrupted no matter what the 
size is. We installed Novell's webserver and used that as troubleshooting step
and the problem does not happen.

Any suggestions on how to resolve this problem.
