>Description:
The format of the error_log for Apache 1.3.6 on Solaris is similar to a syslog 
entry, but we would like to use the format that NCSA used.  I thought it would 
be possible to use LogFormat and CustomLog, but of course they log all requests 
and it is not possible to get it to exclude a whole entry, just certain 
variables (which will print a hyphen if they have no value!)

I know this is minor, but it will help if I can achieve this as I would like to, 
for example, add a referring file entry if a 404.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at NCSA default logfile format.
>Fix:
If you could make the CustomLog directive log only on certain error conditions 
you could create your own error_log format and write a seperate style of 
LogFormat line for every status(or the ones you want to log/monitor)
