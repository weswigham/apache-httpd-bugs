>Description:
$ ./configure --prefix=$APACHE_HOME
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.22
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Solaris 280 platform
 + setting C compiler to cc
 + setting C pre-processor to /lib/cpp
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
 + using builtin Expat
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed.  The below error output from the compilation
** test will give you an idea what is failing. Note that
** Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such as gcc.

 Aborting!
>How-To-Repeat:
untar the apache 1.3.22 distribution and logon to unix as non super user and run the ./configure  --prefix=$APACHE_HOME command from the installed dir
>Fix:
i think the ./helper/dummy.c file has got the syntax error

State-Changed-Why:

The problem is not actually with the dummy.c file, but is
instead with your compiler.  If I remember correctly,
ucbcc is not a good ANSI-C compiler.  You need to
use the proper sun compiler or gcc.

Thanks for using Apache!
