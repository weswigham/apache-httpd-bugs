>Description:
I was trying to run a simple hello world cgi script that I copied out of the
O'Reily Learning Perl book (pg. 184) and when I ran it I was getting an Internal
Server error and the following line in my error.log:
---
[Wed Aug 18 09:07:32 1999] [error] [client xxx.xx.xx.xxx] Premature end of
script headers: d:/webpage/cgi-bin/hello.cgi
---
>How-To-Repeat:
see fix
>Fix:
I made a subtle error in copying the example from the book. The book has this
line:
  print <<END_of_Multiline_Text;
but I had put a space (out of habit) after the << so it looked like this:
  print << END_of_Multiline_Text;

When I removed the space it worked perfectly! I'll bet this has happened to
other people besides me, so it might be worth putting on the FAQ under this
subject heading.

State-Changed-Why:
This is one of a large class of errors, which essentially
is: If it won't run from the command line, it won't run
from Apache.  There are thousands of similar situations.
Thanks very much for the suggestion, however, 
and thanks for using Apache.
