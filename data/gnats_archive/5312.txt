>Description:
I in fact got a core dump once. starting apache normally without ssl
works fine. Reads all virtual hosts correctly and php works. when started with
mod_ssl after a certain amount of vhosts is reached it either core dumps or
php does not work at all. The one core dump i got was most likely cause i was
using up to much virtual memory and was my fault but the fact that 
apache stops working with php when started with ssl is a big problem that you
should address now before you get to many complaints or hackers running
buffer overflow exploits on that core i got.
>How-To-Repeat:
if you need i can send you an example httpd.conf file so you can 
core dump apache or see that php stops working with ssl after a certain
amount of vhosts is reached
>Fix:
I have not looked at the source for mod_ssl but i would imagine it is a question
of mallocing enough buffer space for very large vhost sites. Which buffer is
the cause is hard to say. Maybe loading mod_ssl into apache's memory space
consumes to much and should be increased.

 This is very serious problem please get back to me on this. I have a
 temporary solution to this is to start 2 instances of apache ...one on
 port 80 with php  and another to start apache with SSL on ports 90 and 443
 this way i can use php on normal port 80 and my second httpd.conf file
 only contains limited vhost stuff for ssl so it will work with php

State-Changed-Why:

If the problem only occurs when you're using mod_ssl AND
mod_php, it's probably something to do with one or the
other (or both) of those modules.  Neither of them are
part of the base Apache package, which is all that's
supported here, so you need to contact the development
groups for those modules.
