>Description:
When making concurrent requests to JServ (e.g. IsItWorking servet), Apache child exits after it gets error 10038 from ioctlsocket. In buff.c, the first ioctlsocket fails in recvwithtimeout. After it calls ap_log_assert, it calls exit(1). Here is the error.log in debug level:

[Fri Feb 23 11:17:02 2001] [info] Parent: Created child process 1656
[Fri Feb 23 11:17:02 2001] [info] Parent: Duplicating socket 400 and sending it to child process 1656

[Fri Feb 23 11:17:18 2001] [info] master_main: Child processed exited (due to MaxRequestsPerChild?). Restarting the child process.

The problem only happens on W2K and only relate to request making to Jserv through mod_jserv. If changing buff.c and return INVALID_SOCKET to the caller in recvwithtimout after the 1st ioctlsocket fails, it consistenly reports a crash in MS's wshtcpip.dll after the test runs for awhile. Here is a stack trace:

WSHTCPIP! WSHGetSocketInformation@32 + 79 bytes
MSAFD! SockSetHandleContext@4 + 228 bytes
MSAFD! SockCoreAccept@8 + 316 bytes
MSAFD! WSPAccept@24 + 2642 bytes
WS2_32! WSAAccept@20 + 114 bytes
WS2_32! accept@12 + 21 bytes
worker_main() line 5992 + 17 bytes

main(int 4, char * * 0x00352e18) line 15 + 13 bytes
mainCRTStartup() line 338 + 17 bytes
KERNEL32! 77e992a6()

Although the symtoms are different, the base problem looks like the same. For some reasons in W2K, a WIN32 handler becomes invalid. Something are not synchronized as expected on W2K. It either causes recv or accept fails.

If it does not execute the apj12 handler, the problem will not occur. Not sure how the additional buffer stream in mod_jserv affect the timing condition.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.  Use the 1.3.17 distributed binaries or 1.3.12 build
2.  Use JServ-1.1.2
3.  Use default configuration for both Apache and JServ
4.  Make at least 30 concurrent HTTP requests to /servlets/IsItWorking which comes with JServ by default.
5.  Keep the test running for 10 minutes.

On a dual-PIII system with 512MB RAM, the problem should occur within 2 minutes.
