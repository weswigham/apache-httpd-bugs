>Description:
We had an apache configuration which included the following (cut down and 
names changed for clarity)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4
<VirtualHost 1.2.3.4>
  ServerName foo1
  ServerAlias foo1.bar.com
  DocumentRoot /usr/SD/docs
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteOptions inherit
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 1.2.3.4>
  ServerName foo.bar.com
  ServerAlias foo
  DocumentRoot /usr/SD/docs
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteOptions inherit
</VirtualHost>

<FilesMatch "\.(pcgi|phtml)$">
  AuthName "Foo Protected Resource"
  AuthType Basic
  AuthDBMUserFile foo.passwd
  <Limit GET POST>
    require valid-user
  </Limit>
  ErrorDocument 401 /errors/auth_failed.html
</FilesMatch>

# OK, now we try to even out load on each individual web server cluster
# redirect traffic from foo(number) to foo.
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}   ^foo[0-9]+.*
# a few things might legitimately need to run on a particular web server..
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/One/Directory/.*
RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://foo.bar.com/$1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, when the following URL was loaded:

http://foo1.bar.com/One/Directory/foo.pcgi

The response was contained headers like this:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2000 19:45:58 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) mod_perl/1.24
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Foo Protected Resource"
Location: http://foo.bar.com/errors/auth_failed.html
Connection: close

And the user would get redirected to the "authentication failed"
page without even getting prompted for a password.

However, if I went to http://foo.bar.com/One/Directory/foo.pcgi instead,
the page would work normally, with a "401 Authorization Required", etc.


After some fiddling, I found that the problem was caused by the fact that 
/errors/ was not excluded from the RewriteRule.  Apparently, apache did 
something like this:

"Hm. This page is protected, and they didn't supply the password"
"I need to send them a reply with a 401 header and the contents of
 /errors/auth_failed.html"
"But to get to /errors/auth_failed.html, they need to go over to 
foo.bar.com".
"I'll redirect them there!"

This isn't really quite right.  Granted, the omission of /errors/ from my 
rewrite rule was a bug and I don't expect that it should have worked.  But
the way in which it broke was pretty baffling.
>How-To-Repeat:
My configuration excerpts above should suffice.  The web server which
was having the problem has been corrected.
>Fix:
Perhaps some sort of error message "ErrorDocument is inaccessable on this 
VirtualHost" would have helped to debug the problem?  Does this sound like 
a good idea?
