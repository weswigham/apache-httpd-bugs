Server version Apache/1.0.5
BSDI BSD/OS 2.1 Kernel #0
Pentium PC (make and model uncertain)

also tested on another (undetermined) version of Apache on SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sparc 4.
>Description:
When a cgi returns this result, I believe the webserver should redirect to
the following defined URI.  Although this is probably a little used trick,
moving my scripts from the Netscape Webserver to the Apache webserver has
seriously crippled them.  Here is an example of the full result.

HTTP/1.0 302 FOUND
Location: "http://www.wwwmktg.com"
URI: "http://www.wwwmktg.com"


>How-To-Repeat:
write yourself a cgi which returns the above.
if you run it on a netscape server, the server will redirect to the location
or uri specified (location is specified for compatibility with earlier
http specs).
if you run it on an apache server, an error message is displayed (internal
misconfiguration)...
"The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to
complete your request."
>Fix:
add the handling of this particular result code to apache - i am not sure
if other result codes are handled since i don't normally check the others.

alternatively - please let it be true that this bug is already fixed and 
you tell me it is in the latest version.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun May 11 09:26:32 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Under Apache, normal CGIs do not output the HTTP result
code.  If you want to output _all_ the headers, use
a script with a name starting with nph- and your script
will be expected to output all the headers.

To just send a redirect, just put a 

       Location: http://www.site.com/other/place/

in the headers and Apache will set the right HTTP code by
itself.  This isn't a bug, just a different way of doing
things.
