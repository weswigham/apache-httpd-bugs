>Description:
Sorry: not 100% sure that CGI doesn't *define* this way:

I have a cgi which gives long multiline headers. At least HTTP/1.1 claims,
that multi line headers must start with an extra space/tab as first char of
continuation lines.

Whe I supply those lines from my cgi I get a Bad header complaint from apache.

State-Changed-Why:
First, v1.1 is very obsolete.  We state clearly we can't really
take bug reports for old versions simply because we don't have
the resources to say "it is fixed in new releases" over and
over.

PR#1176 in the database already covers this.  To summarize,
HTTP/1.1 has nothing to do with CGI.  How a CGI communications
to the server is entirely seperate from how a HTTP client
and server communicate.  The CGI spec, such as it is, doesn't
really define anything about continuation lines.
