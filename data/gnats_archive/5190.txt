Slackware 5 Linux Kernel version 2.2.12 #75, pre-compiled bundled Apache
>Description:
.htaccess file :
AuthUserFile /secure/r/room101.co.uk/docs/test/.username
AuthName "Test"
AuthType Basic

require valid-user


I tried downloading and compiling Apache 1.3.9 from ftp.apache.org - this didn't help. 
However, downloading and compiling Apache 1.3.9 on my Slackware 3.5 machine DID work fine.
It doesn't seem to make any difference whether mod_auth.so is loaded as a module or compiled in.

Also, Stronghold 2.2 running on the same machine as I'm having problems with, 
does not suffer from the same problem.

 This is to inform you that my problem is now solved.
 In case you're interested for reference, it seems that 'libcrypt-2.1.1.so'
 as provided by Slackware 5 is somehow broken.  Replacing it with the same
 file from a Red Hat system fixed the problem (it was a much larger file on
 Red Hat so perhaps the Slackware one had missing code).
 
 Regards,
