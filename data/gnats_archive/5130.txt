>Description:
Well, this is a very strange problem :

When i load my web pages (with little java applet) from my apache server, the
applet of the first page require about 2mn or 3mn to be loaded !!
One time this is done, this same page (and same applet), is loaded normaly
(very quickly).
And all other pages, with other applets, are loaded normaly when the first one
is complete.

I've try to start my session by loading an other page (with different
applet). I've found exactly the same problem : several minutes to load the
first applet, and then all other applets are loaded normaly.

To be sure that this is not due to a client configuration problem, i've try
to load those pages directly from a filesystem, without http : all goes
right.

So, ... if you have any idea, please help me.

Configuration : Server : Apache WWW server v 1.2.6 on Linux
Clients : IE4.01

State-Changed-Why:
You need to do what we very clearly ask before you submit
a bug report.  Start with using a current version of Apache.
1.2.6 is... years old.  We can not help you if you insist
on using an ancient version of Apache.

You need to do things like try to replicate the problem
with other clients.  Since Apache knows nothing about applets,
it is extremely unlikely that anything Apache is doing can
make one applet be slow.  Maybe the browser just takes a long
time to invoke that applet for whatever reason...
