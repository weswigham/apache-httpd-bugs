>Description:
Having Apache run as an application in Windows environments is rather encumbering.  If you could allow an option to have it minimize to the system tray while running, it would make my life much happier.  Also, you could have context menus on the system tray icon for editing the conf file, viewing the log file, stopping, and restarting Apache, etc.

Just a logical extension for the existing implementation to make life more convenient.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not a problem, sorry.
>Fix:
If I could somehow find how to implement it myself, I'd make my own build with these options.  Unfortunately, I'm not that good yet.  So I am instead relying on the kindness of strangers.
