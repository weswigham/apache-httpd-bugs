Solaris2,6,2.7
Irix6.5
>Description:
If NIS (yp) is set up as the first hostname
resolver on nsswitch.conf ,
Apache can't be started because
gethostname() never returns FQDN.
>How-To-Repeat:
% ./httpd -t
httpd: cannot determine local host name.
Use the ServerName directive to set it manually.

## Ofcause I set ServerName manually.
>Fix:
On Solaris, I use libbind.a instead of libresolv.a and
libnsl.a but this way couldn't solve this problem 
on IRIX because linking problem occured.

State-Changed-Why:

First off, setting the ServerName directive properly is
effectively manditory, any coincidental success without
this directive is your own blind luck.

We have addressed the issue where gethostname returns no
fqdn (dotted notation) by substituting the ip address in
the forthcoming Apache 1.3.13 release.  I will apply the
same fix to the 2.0b5-dev tree and see where that gets us.

Please try 2.0b5-dev upon it's release, and let us know
if you succeed in running that server without the ServerName
directive.

We aren't implying you shouldn't set it, but we want to
assure that Apache recovers somewhat gracefully.

Thanks for your report and interest in the 2.0 alpha!
