>Description:
I want to deploy Apache on our corporate Intranet after using Cern V3.
Cern uses .www_acl to specify users and groups who can see a particular
file. Apache's .htaccess is obviously much more flexible. However, setting
"AllowOverride AuthConfig" allows .htaccess files (and hence users) to change
the location of the password and group databases. Since this could end up
with a million different databases out in user land, I'd like to restrict it.
Infact, I'd like to give away "require", but not "AuthUserFile" etc etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put "AllowOverride AuthConfig" in access.conf, and put "AuthUserFile /fred/jim"
and "require user bert" in .htaccess. Then, try to modify access.conf so that
only the "require" liness in .htaccess are allowed. Either you don't have any
Auth. related ability, or you have it all.
>Fix:
I have managed to modify (the very well written!) sources. A testament to
the excellent coding is that the changes required to make this work are really
minimal:

If the whole source files are required, please drop me a line and I'm sure
I'll be able to oblige.

With these changes, you can put "AllowOverride Require" in access.conf.
This then allows users to specify "require" lines in .htaccess, without
giving then the ability to use their own password or group files or
authentication realms. "Require" is separate from "AuthConfig", so to
achieve what you had before, you'd have to have "AuthConfig Require".
Note: I've just hacked this in, so your mileage may vary. I need an Apache
Wizard to verify what I've done really.

A quick "nice one!" to everyone who's anything to do with Apache - one
excellent product!

State-Changed-When: Wed Jul 15 11:20:03 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
While you are correct that sometimes you want to be
more restrictive in limiting what commands users can use,
it really isn't practical to start adding each individual's
needs to the AllowOverride directive, since you can quickly
end up wiht a huge number of vastly confusing options.

In 2.0, hopefully there will be a better method of specifying
such restrictions.

For now, your patch will still be in the bugdb so anyone who
is interested can use it.

Thanks.
