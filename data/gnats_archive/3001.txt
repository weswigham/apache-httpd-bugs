Windows 95 OSR2 (Canadian-French)

>Description:
If I set DocumentRoot to "E:/" in srm.conf (and the rest accordingly),
Apache doesn't find the files (index.html)...
If I put files in a sub directory (E:/web/) and change the rest accordingly it
works...
>How-To-Repeat:
Put a index.html file in the root directory of a drive and set DocumentRoot
to the root directory of this drive.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the bug report.
os_canonical_filename under Win32 was not handling the
root of the drive correctly.  The bug fix has been
committed to CVS to http_core.c and util_win32.c.  
You'll be able to get the fix in
the next release of Apache or in the current CVS code
tree.
Thanks for using Apache.
