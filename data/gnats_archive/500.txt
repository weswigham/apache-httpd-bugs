>Description:
Three times since upgrading to 1.2b8 (three weeks) a single hit has logged multiple entries to my access logs.
In a few cases, it has logged over 400 hits, over a span of 15 to 20 minutes.
The additional entries are sometimes a second or two apart, sometimes multiple entries in the same second.
There are other accesses taking place in between the times of the multple entries, these accesses are logged correctly.
I have not been lucky enough to be at the server when these episodes have taken place.
The remote machine has always been using Netscape 1.22 (coincidence?).
I am using mod_log_config, with the following settings in httpd.conf:
TransferLog logs/access_log
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\""
 
>How-To-Repeat:
I have unable to reproduce this. The only thing I found in common is the USER_AGENT = Mozilla/1.22
>Fix:
No. I grep -v the excess lines out of the log file and restart the server.
I have not completely ruled out the possibility that the remote machine may be hitting me hundreds of times due to something at their end, but I never encountered this before.%0

State-Changed-Why:
This appears to be a browser or proxy error not related to
apache.  If it becomes a terrible problem we might be able
to figure out why... but for now it'd be best for you to complain
to webmaster@att.net and ask them for assistance.

Thanks for using Apache!
