Solaris 2.5.1, apache 1.3.3 w/the following modules enabled:

Server Settings, mod_perl.c, mod_setenvif.c, mod_unique_id.c, mod_usertrack.c, mod_headers.c, mod_expires.c, mod_auth_anon.c, mod_auth.c, mod_access.c, mod_rewrite.c, mod_alias.c, mod_userdir.c, mod_speling.c, mod_actions.c, mod_imap.c, mod_asis.c, mod_cgi.c, mod_dir.c, mod_autoindex.c, mod_include.c, mod_info.c, mod_status.c, mod_negotiation.c, mod_mime.c, mod_log_config.c, mod_env.c, http_core.c
>Description:
Using [L] on a RewriteRule doesn't work.

See section on How to Duplicate.
>How-To-Repeat:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteOptions inherit
RewriteLog logs/rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 3

# Redirect end-user '~/usrID' page requests to main WWW server...
RewriteRule ^/~(.+) http://www.fccj.org/~$1 [L]

# Pass-thru 'Local Resource' to current WWW server...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !-U
RewriteRule   ^(.+)  -  [L]


# Redirect 'Resource Not Found' to main WWW server...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} -U
RewriteRule ^(.+) http://www.fccj.org$1 [L]
>Fix:
No, but I am wondering if mod_perl is planning on
superceding the mod_rfewrite mod_rewrite module ?

 Hi :]  Thx for getting back to me.
 
 The L option in rewrites doesn't appear to stop
 the rewrite engine.  But then again, maybe I don't know
 what I am doing...
 
 Any ways, rewrites which should forward 'Not Founds' to
 another server do not appear to work, IE:
 
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-U
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} -U
 RewriteRule   ^(.+)  -  [L]
 RewriteRule ^(.+) http://www.fccj.org$1 [L]
 
 (The above is used under a virtual host...)
 
 
 But, as I said, and after spending a lot of 'days' on this
 I am not sure I care anymore.  Would just like better support or
 clearer documentation on Rewriting, etc.
 
 As afr as writing the 'clearer' docs myself, I would if
 Icould get a straight answer as to why things work this
 way or that, but either people are busy or honestly
 don't know.  So...  At any rate, I am living without
 Rewriting working - at least working the way I thought!  ;)
 
 Thx  :]
