>Description:
Htpasswd, htdigest and mod_auth_digest use tmpnam(NULL), which won't
work in HP-UX 11 if -lpthread is in link. 

I got the following from HP's tech support:

"This is covered by the man page for tpmnam().

$ man tmpnam
....
   tmpnam()       Always generates a file name using the path-prefix
                  .....
                  in that array and returns s.  For multi-thread
                  applications, if s is a NULL pointer, the
                  operation is not performed and a NULL pointer is
                  returned.

ie for multi-threaded applications you need to supply the address of
the buffer tmpnam should use."
>How-To-Repeat:
I built apache with:
CC=cc CFLAGS="-g +e" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache_1.3.9 \
            --enable-module=rewrite
make

Now try to run htpasswd in src/support:

$ ./htpasswd -c test test
New password: ....
Re-type new password: ....
./htpasswd: unable to create temporary file
fopen: No such file or directory
>Fix:
Either remove -lpthread from LIBS in src/Configure (that's what I did
as I couldn't figure out any reason to use -lpthread in link phase)
or if it is needed to link with -lpthread provide a pointer 
(to array of at leas L_tmpnam bytes) to tmpnam call.

State-Changed-Why:
As of the next release after 1.3.12, Apache will pass a
buffer in to tmpnam(), avoiding this problem.  Thanks!
