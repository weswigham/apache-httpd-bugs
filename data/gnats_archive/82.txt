>Description:
Hi, I have two enhancement requests for suexec.
First, the cgi-bin directory has to be hard-coded into suexec. This
means that only one cgi-bin can be used with one server process
(plus the users_dirs). However, with virtual servers, we want to have
one cgi_bin per virtual server. This is currently not possible with
suexec.
Second, I'd like to be able to execute the cgi-bin chrooted. It should
be fairly easy to enhance suexec to allow one more argument, the root directory.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add a new configuration parameter, CGIChrootDirectory, which is passed
to suexec. In suexec, check its validity and do a chroot first
