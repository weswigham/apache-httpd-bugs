Apache/1.2b7
Linux 2.0.18
Installed the precompiled binary from RedHat
>Description:
When opening a web page on the local network here, the web page comes up with no problem
However, when going outside our network, the same page will only load to about
1074 bytes and then not load any further.  At first I thought it might be a routing
anomoly, but after viewing the source for the HTML page determined it was not.
   The page was created in MS Publisher and had lines starting with spaces and tabs.
When this page was viewed across several links (even inside our network, but maybe
5 hops down to a downstream ISP) it wouldn't load properly. (ie either it would hang
at a certain byte level OR it would say (one lynx) HTTP/1.1 200 OK and nothing else)
  After hand-editing the page
and taking out the lines that started with tabs and spaces the page loaded properly.
    The client was advised to try a differnet html editor and changed to front page.
Front Page does the same thing, in that some lines start with spaces and tabs and the same
symptoms occur anywhere when trying to load this page.  Once again, after hand-editing the page
to take out the tabs/spaces the pages loaded fine.
    Also, when transfering the web pages to a different server, namely an NT box
running O'Reillys WebSite or another unix box running Apache 1.0.1 the page serves correctly.  
>How-To-Repeat:
I have since moved the client's web pages to another server, but I have the old pages
for testing.  Try URL:
http://virtweb4.mis.net/dennery/page7.html 
>Fix:
No idea.  Hand editing is too time consuming, and we cannot proscribe the 
HTML editors that our clients can use.  It does work on Apache 1.0.1 and
other web servers.

 This is almost certainly not an Apache problem.  There are various network
 related issues that can cause it.  You may want to upgrade your kernel
 (don't track Linux kerenel versions, don't know if the one you have is
 buggy or not; all too many are).
 
 Please do something like a:
 
 	tcpdump host virtweb4.mis.net and host remote.site and port 80
 
 while trying to access the page from remote.site (change the name
 obviously) and mail me the output. This will give a dump of what the
 server is trying to send.  It is probably something like some router not
 liking packets over a certain size or formed in a certain way.  I think
 the data you are seeing it with is just a coincidence.  Try a different
 page with the same formatting but completely different text; can you
 reproduce it there?

Assuming user resolved problem.  It's almost certainly not an
apache problem.
