>Description:
Some of our customers' CGI scripts broke when we upgraded to 1.3.0, because
they used the REMOTE_HOST environment variable.  Since we run with DNS lookups
turned off, this disappeared in 1.3.0.  Yet there is no mention of the change
in http://www.apache.org/docs/upgrading_to_1_3.html
They'll have to switch to using REMOTE_ADDR, but there should be a warning
about that in the upgrade notes.  It was certainly not previously clear
that it was wrong to assume that REMOTE_HOST would always be set.
>How-To-Repeat:
Probably more than a few CGI scripts are affected by this.
>Fix:
Please add a mention of this problem in the upgrade notes.
