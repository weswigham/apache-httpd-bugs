>Description:
On standard compilations of apache 1.3.12 and 1.3.14, both send the same PDF file data
to the client, but with 1.3.14, when saving the file in Acrobat Reader plugin 
(4.05c) in MSIE 5.0 (various incarnations) MSIE locks up, not even managing to save the file.

This is with the exact same compile options, same configuration files etc.

Diffing the headers sent show some differences in the multipart-headers (Range: headers)
but I can't debug them.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using windows of some sort, MSIE 5.x and Acrobat Reader Plugin 4.05, try loading the
following PDF files, and then saving them from the plugin iuterface:

http://www.sef.no/vedlegg/166/strategi.pdf <- Apache 1.3.12 - works
http://lottery.sef.no/strategi.pdf <- Apache 1.3.14 - fails

This is the case on all my test-cases at least.

The documents in question are not cofidential.

 The patch is broken. It introduces a new return value for
 internal_byterange but it doesn't change all the code that calls
 internal_byterange (directly or indirectly) to accommodate the change.
 e.g. default_handler calls ap_each_byterange assuming that the return
 value is boolean; ap_each_byterange is a wrapper around
 internal_byterange which does not return a boolean.

 I'm still looking. I'm not convinced that parse_byterange handles
 whitespace right, and IE is fond of putting whitespace into its Range:
 headers.

 You are right -- I missed that. I'm looking at parse_byterange now
 because I think that may be the culprit.

 Or maybe not. I think I am seeing the problem now but although IE
 sometimes pauses for seconds when reloading the PDF file, the
 transaction looks no different from my end of the connection *except*
 that it seems to be associated with new connections -- keep-alive
 connections are fast.
 
 (Bah, why can't Windows close a TCP connection properly?)
 
 There's another bit of Joe's patch that I don't understand -- it seems
 to break calculation of the content-length. Fixing this doesn't seem
 to fix the problem, however.
 
 Tony.

 hi everybody.
 
 i encountered another possible hint to that pdf-problem.
 
 1. when i disable KeepAlive, everything just works fine.
 
 2.1. if i enable KeepAlive, and i have just a request to a pdf,
      and the make a new request to an ordinary html file,
      a bunch of 'weird' characters appread before the correct content
      of the html. somehow data from the old request merge into
      the new, independant request.
 
 2.2. if i wait KeepAliveTimeout seconds, before i make that second
      request, then this second request is just fine.
 
 our quick-fix is now to disable keepalive, in order to get the
 pdf-viewer problems work.
 
 cheers, tobi

 Hi everybody,
 
 I have the same problem, so I am runing 1.3.12 on the server.
 
 It sounds like that there is a patch that solves the problem, but where do I
 find it? I do not have any C-compilers so I am not able to re-compile the
 source code.
 
 Regards from Mikkel

 Yes, but if you don't have a compiler it won't be any use to you.
 There's a candidate patch for 1.3.15 at
 http://apache.org/~fanf/http_protocol.patch.fanf

 So was this problem solved and is it incorporated in the current 1.3.20
 release?  How do I tell?  I am currently running 1.3.12 and 1.3.14.  1.3.12
 doesn't appear to have the problem and 1.3.14 appears to have it
 intermittently.
