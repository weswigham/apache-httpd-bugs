State-Changed-Why:
This may or may not be addressed for the 1.2.* versions,
but it's already been included for the 1.3 and later
streams.  Try changing the helpers/GuessOS line from
"SINIX*)" to "SINIX-?:* | ReliantUNIX-?:*)" and see
if it builds properly.

State-Changed-Why:
In the forthcoming 1.2.6 release (as well as in the current
1.3 beta), GuessOS was corrected appropriately to detect
ReliantUNIX and SINIX as equivalent. Additionally, the
_XPG_IV define is set to work around an interface problem
of the gettimeofday() call. So, 1.2.6 should run "as-is"
on both SINIX and ReliantUNIX.
