State-Changed-Why:
TCP/IP networking is _NOT_ correctly installed on the 
machine.  If you cannot _ping_ your machine, it isn't ready
to have Apache installed on it.  If it is Windows 95, be
sure the WinSock2 upgrade from Microsoft is installed.  If 
you work from a dial-up connection, be sure you are
connected so Apache 'sees' networking.

This problem will be somewhat alievated in the next release.
Thanks for your interest in the Apache httpd server project!
