>Description:
I am running a CGI Bin script to process some files and serve them as html
files. The CGI Bin script is set up using an action command in a .htaccess file.
I am setting Last-Modified headers because I want to the data cached.
Last-Modified headers are not supposed to have a time in advance of the
Date header. So I tried to create a Date header as well using the current time
and then checked to make sure the Last-Modified header was not in the future.
However when I looked at the returned date headers, they were not matching
the date obtained by my CGI Bin script. In fact they appear to use a time
from before the CGI Bin script was run. I noticed this because I had set
a Expires header one year in advance and noticed a discrepency in the seconds
part of the date and time.
I would expect that letting the CGI Bin script override the Date header that
the server supplies would be the best answer. If the date header was obtained
after the the script ran than at least the test versus the Last-Modified
header would work without making guesses about how much delay there can be
in running the script. Another alternative would be to pass the date that is
going to be used in the date header to the CGI Bin script. (I looked to see
if this was done and couldn't find any date information in the environment
or standard input.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up an action to run a cgibin script. Have the script obtain the current
date and write a date header and the same header with some other name. Then
telnet to the web server and issue a HEAD request with a URI that will
trigger the action. The returned date header will be less than or equal to
the date and time on the test header. At our site I typically saw a 1 second
difference, though on at least one occasion there was a 13 second difference.
>Fix:
Let the Date header returned by the CGI Bin script for the action replace the
server generated Date header.

State-Changed-Why:
The Date response field is one of those that Apache does
not permit to be overridden, since it refers to the time
at which the server began sending the response.  Other
filters or operations that might be performed on a
script's output may delay this, or a script might emit
a bogus Date field, so this is one of the field reserved
to the server itself.  See the last paragraph at
<http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_headers.html>.

 In that case, I would like to suggest a change to pass a copy of the Date
 header value in the environment to cgi-bin scripts. This would allow cgi-bin
 scripts to make sure that their Last-Modified headers aren't greater than
 their Date headers without having to make guesses about worst case latencies.
 
 Thanks for looking into this.
