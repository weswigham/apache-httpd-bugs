Tru64 Unix V4.0 878 alpha platform.

Apache version 1.3.12 (Unix) with AuthMySQL/2.20 and PHP/3.0.16.
>Description:
I'm trying to get autoindex to use HEADER.html files in fancyindexing.  It worked several versions of Apache (and
PHP) ago, but I recently realized that it isn't anymore.

The HEADER.html file exists and is readable.  It is successfully reading
"AddDescription" notes from .htaccess.  I can turn FancyIndexing, 
SuppressLastModified, and SuppressDescription on and off
from the global conf file or from the local .htaccess file.  Yet,
ScanHTMLTitles, SuppressHTMLPreamble, ReadmeName, and HeaderName all have 
zero effect.

I'm suspicious that our PHP module (which parses all .html and .php files on
our server) might be interfering somehow, but I have no real evidence of
that.  It seems to me that this suspicion is somewhat contradicted by the fact
that the AddDescriptions work...

Any suggestions/answers/similar experience would be appreciated.
>How-To-Repeat:
Don't know how you would repeat it, but here's a sample URL that I'm trying 
to "fix": http://www.nnlm.nlm.nih.gov/pnr/samplers/  (You can at least see
that the +ScanHTMLTitles and +SuppressHTMLPreamble are not working.

Here's the current .htaccess file for that directory:

Options +Indexes
Options +Multiviews
Options +FollowSymLinks
IndexOptions +FancyIndexing
IndexOptions -SuppressLastModified
IndexOptions -SuppressDescription
IndexOptions +ScanHTMLTitles
IndexOptions +SuppressHTMLPreamble

ReadmeName README
HeaderName HEADER

AddDescription "HIV/AIDS Resources" aidspath.html
AddDescription "Getting Started with E-Mail" e-mail.html
AddDescription "HIV/AIDS Res for Native Americans" naaids.html
AddDescription "Native American Resources" natamer.html
AddDescription "Public Health" pubhlth.html
AddDescription "Rural Health" rural.html
AddDescription "Veterinary Medicine" vetmed.html

I wish I did.

 I discovered the exact same problem, and found that "Options MultiViews"
 must be set for FancyIndexing to work.
 
 I can't explain why setting "Options MultiViews" didn't work for you,
 because it definitely got FancyIndexing to work for me. My Apache is running
 patched for FrontPage 4 Extensions (don't ask my why). Are you running a
 patched Apache?
 
 In any case, I believe THIS IS A BUG! I don't want or need to run
 MultiViews, but it's the only way I can get the FancyIndexing to work on
 Apache 1.3.12, which used to work fine on my old Apache server. If I can
 find the time, I'll look into whether it's an Apache bug, or some pathogen
 brought in by fp4.

 I must apologize for my previous message, as I used the wrong terms to
 describe the problem.  The truth is that FancyIndexing works regardless of
 MultiViews.
 
 It's the inclusion of the HEADER.html and README.html that doesn't work
 unless Option MultiViews is set. However, I've found that this isn't a bug,
 after all. It's a design feature! I quote directly from the configuration
 file:
 
 # ReadmeName is the name of the README file the server will look for by
 # default, and append to directory listings.
 #
 # HeaderName is the name of a file which should be prepended to
 # directory indexes.
 #
 # If MultiViews are amongst the Options in effect, the server will
 # first look for name.html and include it if found.  If name.html
 # doesn't exist, the server will then look for name.txt and include
 # it as plaintext if found.
 
 Now, I don't think appending .html should have anything at all to do with
 MultiViews, but there it is in black-and-white. Perhaps one of the
 developers can decide if this is better managed outside the MultiViews
 option, and if not, explain why. 'Cuz I don't get it.

 Paul,
 
 Thanks for taking in interest in this frustrating problem!
 
 Yes, our Apache is "patched."  We have included PHP/4.0.1pl2 and
 AuthMySQL/2.20 in Apache/1.3.12.
 
 Would gladly conduct experiments if I had any idea what to try.

Comment-Added:

HEADER and README are 1st - case sensitive, and 2nd - they
require proper mime type setups (including a fallback
DefaultType text/plain (or text/html) for simply README
or HEADER to be understood.)

HEADER.html in your example should work.  There are a
number of interacting flukes that are fixed in Apache 2.0.23
which may solve your problem.  If not, this appears to be
a (tangled) configuration problem.

If you have set a handler on .html files, that could be
interfering.
