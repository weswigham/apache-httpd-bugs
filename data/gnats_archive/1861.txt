>Description:
If you send a message to apbugs@apache.org which doesn't have one of the magic
subjects it will become a pending PR.  But the pending PR isn't mailed to
apache-bugdb so folks don't know it's there... and when you do find it via
the query-pr interface and change it, the change will be mailed to apache-bugdb
but folks won't have seen the original.

State-Changed-Why:
yes, gnats sucks.  Recommended fix: implement a new
bug database backend in mysql & mod_jserv or mod_perl or
heck even mod_php.  Any takers?  Maybe Rasmus would let
us use the one he has for the PHP project.
