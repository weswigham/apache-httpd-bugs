SunOS cksun2 5.8 Generic_108528-04 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
Apache 1.3.9 bundled with Solaris 8
>Description:
Really sorry to bother you all but I've loked and been trying to fix this for 2 days without success.
First this is a completely generic install with all of the default file locations from the Solaris install intact.
I set up a directory to require user/password access. I've added the Directory directives to httpd.conf and created a user using htpasswd
and created the .htaccess file in the "protected directory". Whenever I access this dir from a link on my index page
I get the user/pw screen, enter the user/pw and then get a second user/pw screen.
I again enter the user/pw and am then given access to the protect dir. 
Here are the bits and pieces:

from httpd.conf:

#
# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#
<Directory "/var/apache/htdocs">

#
# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".
#
# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you.
#
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

#
# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
# override. Can also be "All", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo", 
# "AuthConfig", and "Limit"
#
    AllowOverride None

#
# Controls who can get stuff from this server.
#
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory /var/apache/htdocs/cad-history-pdf>
AllowOverride AuthCOnfig
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

.htaccess:

AuthName "C&K Product Drawings History"
AuthUserFile /etc/apache/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthType Basic
require user jabba
>How-To-Repeat:
Try the same Apache version on Solaris 8?
>Fix:
not a clue - I've tried every combination possible.
