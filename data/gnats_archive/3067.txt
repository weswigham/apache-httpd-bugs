>Environment:
JSK 1.2beta4 on Solaris 2.6/x86, but probably platform-independent
>Description:
String consisting of a single space in any config file being read by 
org.apache.java.util.Configurations makes it hang for a long time and then throw
the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.

>How-To-Repeat:

by org.apache.java.util.Configurations. Get some patience and watch.
>Fix:
Easy fix:
