Unixware 2.1.2
UNIX_SV a2k 4.2MP 2.1.2 i386 x86at
>Description:
I have two webservers. Server1 uses ProxyPass to let clients access server2.
This works just fine. But when I restrict access to server1 and the client tries
to access server2, the client gets "407 Proxy Authentification required" 
What is wrong??? This worked just fine with Apache 1.2.5. I use the following 
configuration:
ServerType standalone
HostnameLookups off
User nobody
Group nobody
ServerAdmin webmaster@a2k.postnet.se
ServerRoot "/usr/htroot"
DocumentRoot "/usr/htdocs"
ErrorLog logs/error_log
CustomLog logs/access_log common
ScoreBoardFile logs/apache_runtime_status
ServerName web.wide.world.se
ServerSignature on
UseCanonicalName on
KeepAlive On
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPass /web2 http://web2.wide.world.se
<Location ~ ".*">
   Options FollowSymLinks Includes MultiViews ExecCGI
   AllowOverride None
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "OnLine"
   AuthUserFile /usr/etc/passwd
   <Limit GET POST>
      require valid-user
   </Limit>
</Location>
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up 2 web servers.  Have one proxy the other using the above configuration. 
Netscape reports 407 Proxy Authentification required.
