NT4 Server (SP2)(build 1381)
VC++ 4.2
>Description:
The makefile for NT are not perfect for the nmake of VC4.2:
1)the /FD option don't exist
2)the rules :
.c{$(CPP_OBJS)}.obj::
don't works because there is two ':' 
the rigth syntaxe is :
.c{$(CPP_OBJS)}.obj:
( note the simple ':')
3)there is a lot of empty lines with blanks. Not a problem for nmake but
ntemacs's makefile-mode complaint about this.

State-Changed-Why:
It is clearly stated that Apache on windows will required
MS VC++ 5.0 to compile (see http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html).
It is unfortunate the Microsoft do not make the generated
Makefiles backward compatible to their previous releases, but 
this is not something within our control. All Makefiles
(apart for makefile.nt) are automatically generated by MSVC.
