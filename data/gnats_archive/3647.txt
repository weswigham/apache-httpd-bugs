FreeBSD 2.2.6  i386
>Description:
I hav a BSDI machine that works just fine.  The Freebsd machine won't recognize
the mime type and says that it wont recognize the plugin for .ram and it says that
the .rm file is blank.  Same file works fine on BSDI machine.  The conf files 
are exactly the same.

State-Changed-Why:
It sounds like a problem with your configuration.  Of course
saying that isn't very helpful, but there's not much I can do.
My guess is that apache isn't reading the configuration files
you think it is -- or it's reading more files than you think it
is.
