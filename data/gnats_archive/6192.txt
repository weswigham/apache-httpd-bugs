Red Hat 6.2, have installed binaries from the apache website.
>Description:
On my system at home I had installed Apache 1.3.9 and it worked fine. After upgrading to Apache 1.3.12, I lost the ability for people to see the web page. Apache simply forbids access to the site.

I am now working on an Apache webserver at work and am having the same issue arise. In both cases I installed the binaries from the Apache website. At home I tried not only using the httpd.conf from the 1.3.9 install, I also tried a modified httpd.conf from my Windows '95 Apache 1.3.12 install (modified b/c I changed the directory names to be appropriate for the Linux install).

Help would greatly be appreciated.
