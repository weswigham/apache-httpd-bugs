* nfs is only /vol, other directory is ufs.
* use cronolog-1.6.1 for rotating log.
* use ssl module - 'mod_ssl-2.6.4-1.3.12'.
* virtual host - upon IP, 80 and 8080, ssl - 443.

something doubted

State-Changed-When: Mon Sep 18 12:59:46 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Don't use `kill -9` because it doesn't give the server a
chance to clean up after itself. Just use kill without a
signal option (so that it uses SIGTERM).
