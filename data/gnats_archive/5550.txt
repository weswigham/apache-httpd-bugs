>Description:
I am writing a special module for apache in the win32 environment. I declare
one of my directives in command_rec for my module as follows
{
 "archiv", set_scanview_connection, NULL, ACCESS_CONF, TAKE13,
 "name of archiv, optional followed by username and password"
},

Case 1)
If I put a line like this in the httpd.conf
<pre>
archiv svpdev user passwd
</pre>
everything goes well.

Case 2)
<pre>
archiv svpdev user
</pre>
the server gave me the cmd->info string.

Case 3)
<pre>
archiv svpdev
</pre>
the server crashes in http_config.c line# 884
<pre>
if (*w == '\0' || (*w2 && !w3) || *args != 0)
</pre>
In this case, the pointer w2 is NULL and therefore the program crashes with an 
"access violation". I now, I can't dereference a NULL pointer. I propose the
following line:
<pre>
if (*w == '\0' || (w2 && *w2 && !w3) || *args != 0)
</pre>
This checks the pointer w2 before we are going to derefence him.
