>Description:
When you perform a recompilation, the current buildmark stuff inserts only
the C compiler date and time.  One problem with this is that this is not
the "standard" UNIX date/time format....The other problem is that one is
unable to more easily assign a number to the build like most UNIX system 
or software generations.  There should be a counter that increments each
time a httpd is rebuilt.  

The attached set of context diffs into the .../src/ area addresses the
above problems.  Basically a simple
/bin/sh program is called creating an include file containing the string.
A few minor changes are required to do this (see the patch below).

The string for the server built date looks like

Tue Apr 21 08:48:41 PDT 1998 - Build #14

Which is nicer.
>How-To-Repeat:
All the time....

change for later versions
