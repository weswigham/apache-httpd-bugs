The workaround for this is to manually start Apache JServ (set
"ApjServManual on"
in the httpd.conf file).  The SocketException is thrown by
AuthenticatedServerSocket, but I'm not sure why...I do know that the
constructor
does not specify an IP address, when I think maybe it should for
"localhost".  Without specifying an IP address when the ServerSocket is
constructed, the IP address will be 0.0.0.0, and I think Win95 TCP/IP
and/or DNS might have trouble with that address somewhere along the
line.
