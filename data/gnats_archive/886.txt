>Description:
in http_core.c, the interpretation of tag directives seems to be flawed.  If you put more than one tag on a line
(for example, <IfModule x.c>blah blah</IfModule>), it will try to compare against module "x.c>blah blah</IfModule" --
and generally bad stuff happens.

The first thing I tried changing is to use strchr() instead of strrchr(), which then correctly sets the module
to "x.c", but this doesn't fix the behavior; 'blah blah' is not executed.  I think this is due to what the function
does with stuff between the tags, which I haven't absorbed enough to understand how to fix it.

The temporary fix is to just not put more than one tag on a line.  Of course, this bug report assumes
that it is desirable to be able to place more than one tag on a line.
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be self-evident -- just try using more than one on a line, and look at what the function does
>Fix:
Well, a start to fixing it is in the full description, which is to change strrchr to strchr.  However, it still needs
to be changed to interpret the rest of the line (i.e. the stuff in between the tags) correctly.

State-Changed-Why:
Um do any of the docs indicate this should be possible?  Because
we certainly don't support it, and probably won't ever.  Not
without a complete and total config syntax rewrite -- right now
end-of-line is a very significant marker in the config language.
The need for it is driven by the dynamic nature of the config
language.  While it's certainly possible to build an extensible
language without a magic end-of-line, it doesn't seem worth the
effort at the moment. 

But hey if bind can go from directive-per-line to freeform whitespace
delimited then maybe apache will someday too.
