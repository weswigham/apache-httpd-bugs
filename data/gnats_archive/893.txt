>Description:
As in problem 737, I am seeing authentication failures for CGI scripts, 
requests are proxied, and failure is common, but not 100% repeatable.

smtpgate.gannett.com - - [21/Jul/1997:13:44:13 -0400] "POST /cgi/gancar.cgi HTTP
/1.0" 401 -
smtpgate.gannett.com - - [21/Jul/1997:13:44:29 -0400] "POST /cgi/gancar.cgi HTTP
/1.0" 401 -
smtpgate.gannett.com - gancar [21/Jul/1997:13:44:29 -0400] "POST /cgi/gancar.cgi
 HTTP/1.0" 200 183

The successful request was the result of a relaod, 
ScriptAlias /cgi/ /home/httpd/html/GC/cgi-bin/
is in srm.conf

Scripts live in /home/httpd/html/GC/cgi-bin  .htaccess was in GC, and now is in
all directories.  Access.conf contains:
AllowOverried Authconfig for /home/httpd/html

along with:

<Directory /home/httpd/html/GC/cgi-bin>
AllowOverride All
Options All
</Directory>

CGI in question is doing HTTP file upload, browser Netcape 3.01, error message
box says "A network error occured while Netscape was sending data.  (Network Error: Connection aborted)  Try connecting again."

 
>How-To-Repeat:
It would seem that queries coming through a proxy are more likely to trigger 
the event.  I am unable to provide a URL, but would be happy to provide the
CGI scripts and libraries.  It also seems that only POSTs to 
enctype=multipart/form-data (HTTP file upload) trigger this.

1.1 is no longer supported; please try 1.2.  This specific

closes the connection while the client is still sending
data; this happens when the server tells the client that
authorization is required.  Because the client is still
sending data, it breaks.

 I upgraded to the current release with no changes in operation.
 Re-authenticating with a different username/password then going back
 succeeds.  The initial behaviour is still broken.

 It is possibly partly a proxy problem when going through a proxy.  This
 certainly looks to be the known issue I mentioned earlier.  If the proxy
 and server are both running Apache 1.2 on the right platforms it should
 work fine.
 
 Please state the exact setup of what version of what program running on
 what OS is being used for both the server and the proxy.  Is the problem
 that the Apache proxy causes problems or is the problem that accessing an
 Apache server causes problems.
