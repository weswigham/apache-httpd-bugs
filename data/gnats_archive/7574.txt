>Description:
apache -? does not list the -w switch
The installer created a shortcut with

c:\apache> Apache.exe -w -n Apache -k start

A seperate issue, not too far from the same,
c:\apache> Apache --help  
Does not dump usage info, instead serves up pages if config ok.

Neither are pressing, more like cobwebs in the closet.  :-\
>How-To-Repeat:
apache -?
apache --help

State-Changed-Why:

Isn't documented, since it's strictly in the context of
keeping a window open (such as from a shortcut).  As a
command-line option, it is merely be an annoyance.

As for --help, no, apache has only one syntax for help.
