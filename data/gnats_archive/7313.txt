I use binary release
>Description:
Sometimes I shutdown windows, windows will tell me, some program is still in running. close them. Then I shutdown windows again, everything seems to be OK.
Such situation occur about 70% of the time.

But after three days try, I found that if I shutdown httpd first, then Windows could be shutdown normally. This problem never occurs then.

I upgrade httpd from 1.3.14 to 1.3.17, this problem never occurs on 1.3.14.
>How-To-Repeat:
as indicated in full description. I can not expect windows shutdown httpd automatically in all the times. I have to manually shutdown httpd.
>Fix:
It's.... why not this bug in 1.3.14?

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Thu Aug 30 09:57:04 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Windows consumer os's (9x/me) are entirely unsupported.
The behavior you observe is an interaction that was
introduced when we enabled the ability to 1. run as a service
and 2. use the close window button/ctrl+c sequences on
win9x.  Sorry we can't be of more help.
