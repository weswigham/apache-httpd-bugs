>Description:
The installed sbin/apachectl script *always* says "httpd started", even if
Apache falls over and dies spectacularly as it initialises !
>How-To-Repeat:
Mis-configure your Apache to deliberately crash out during initialisation.
Run "apachectl start" and see the script say "httpd started", despite the
httpd having fallen over during initialisation.
>Fix:
Add extra checks after starting the httpd into the apachectl script.
For example, sleep a few seconds and then do the same check that you do
to see if it's already running again (i.e. look for the PIDFILE, do a ps -p
and so on) - that way you can truly report whether the httpd has properly
inited. I'd also recommend that on a start failure, you tell the user
to look in <apacheinstalltree>/var/log/error_log for the reason for the
failure.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm not able to reproduce your problem.

If there is an error in your config file apachectl
should display the error message from httpd and the message
"apachectl start: httpd could not be started".

Do you see any errors in your error_log?

Are other apachectl options (status, restart, etc.)
working properly?

 Under HP-UX, if you leave the Group setting in httpd.conf as #-1 (which
 is what it's set to by default), you get "httpd started" output by
 apachectl and yet the httpd dies immediately. The error_log says:
 
 [Sat Jul 18 00:11:57 1998] [alert] Child 997 returned a Fatal error... 
 Apache is exiting!
 [Sat Jul 18 00:11:57 1998] [alert] (22)Invalid argument: setgid: unable to set
 group id to Group 4294967295
 
 Similarly giving a non-existent user ID (e.g. #29238 when that UID isn't
 in the password field) for the User field in httpd.conf causes the same
 problem - httpd exits, but apachectl reports "httpd started" - error_log
 in that case says:
 
 [Sat Jul 18 00:13:35 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid:
 couldn't determine user name from uid 29238, you pro
 bably need to modify the User directive
 [Sat Jul 18 00:13:36 1998] [alert] Child 1014 returned a Fatal error... 
 Apache is exiting!

 I would put it back to serious :-) Problem is that outputting "httpd started"
 is a little misleading in the above cases (although "strictly true" because
 the httpd process does actually start) because it dies during the
 initialisation. A check that the process is still running after a couple of
 seconds would make the message output by apachectl more believable.
 
 I don't know if any other config changes other than User/Group would cause
 httpd to die during initialisation (and after forking, hence the failure
 of the original httpd to return an error status code), but it's something
 apachectl doesn't pick up when it really should.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm not sure I agree.  Strictly speaking, the message is
accurate; the server *did* get off the ground.  Dying
immediately thereafter is different from never having
lived at all.  Where is the threshold?  How does this
differ from the server dying an hour later?  In either case
the cause of its non-running state is in the error log,
which may or may not be the case for an error during the
actual startup.
