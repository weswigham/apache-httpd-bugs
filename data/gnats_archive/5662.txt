>Release:        1.3.9
>Organization:
>Environment:
Win95.0.0.b (OSR2)
>Description:
Every time I run my CGI program, which is a MS-DOS executable
compiled in Borland C, Apache forks a process which visually opens
a window on my Desktop for the 200ms or so that my program executes.
This is very annoying.  It did not happen on 1.3.3 or 1.3.6.  (Presumably
because they did not seem to fork new processes but exec'ed the CGI
locally, but that's a guess.)
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't have a demo setup, but if you can't easily recreate but want to
track it, let me know and where to email the needed files.
>Fix:
Fork process the same way 1.3.6 did.
Better yet, allow a way to run the CGI process through a .pif so that
it can be configured to run miminized.  (Or however else you get things
to run minimized.)
>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:35:22 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Windows apache never 'fork'ed.

There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
