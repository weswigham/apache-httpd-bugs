"RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}   !-s

1) The second RewriteCond should be a RewriteRule.
2) the -s and -f checks seem  to just do a stat() on what they are given, anyway, so unless your documentroot is / then the file will never exist?
3) Under what conditions *would* this work? :)

Subst RewriteCond for RewriteRule in second line.
Add note, or additional info into file-test section to clarify if they check URIs or files (this example implies URIs, the docs says 'file').

 Done.

 There is the following note:
 
 | ATTENTION: Depending on your server-configuration it can be necessary to
 | slightly change the examples for your situation, e.g. adding the [PT] flag
 | when additionally using mod_alias and mod_userdir, etc. Or rewriting a ruleset
 | to fit in <tt>.htaccess</tt> context instead of per-server context. Always try
 | to understand what a particular ruleset really does before you use it. It
 | avoid problems.
 
 Here the ruleset was originally used in .htaccess context and there
 is should work as written down (although I've not tried it since two
 years).
