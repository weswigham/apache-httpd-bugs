>Environment:
OS : NetBSD 1.3
compiler : gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
The ScoreBoardFile variable in the httpd.conf file is defined this way:

ScoreBoardFile logs/apache_runtime_status

This was fine for previous releases of Apache but now it should be defined this
way:

ScoreBoardFile /usr/local/apache/var/logs/apache_runtime_status
>How-To-Repeat:
No URL is necessary :-)
>Fix:
Of course, just change the httpd.conf and httpd.conf.default files as I say
