With Apache running and logged on as root. Hit the reset button. LM 8 will recover Apache will not. Even if you reinstall Apache.

State-Changed-When: Mon Aug 13 11:04:20 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
You certainly don't need to reinstall the OS to make
Apache work after a hard shutdown, but you don't
provide any details about what is actually going wrong.

I suggest you take your problem to a user support forum
like news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix

Thanks for using Apache!

 OK,
 
     Lets try this again. One of my servers hard locked will useing grip in LM 8.
 Grip has a bug in the memory allocation. This causes a fast hard lock.
 You must use the reset button to reboot. I have been to every forum and help
 page including the site you  recomended . I have also read the manual ( your not
 going to get to far in linux if you dont know how to read, if you know what i
 mean?) I have spent two weeks on this problem. Writing apache was my last
 resort not my first. Ive used Apache servers for over three years on many
 different machines and never had this problem until i started using Linux
 Mandrake 8.

 Based on your email address, I doubt you're going to get this, but
 let's try anyway:
 
 The problem is you provided absolutely no details about what isn't
 working.  Just saying "Apache will not restart" is about as descriptive
 as saying "my car won't go" to a mechanic.
 
 I don't recall seeing your posting in comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.
 Can you give me the subject line or message ID and I will take
 a look there.
 
 Joshua.

 These messages do not come from Apache.  They come from whatever
 start-up script your system is using.  We have no knowledge
 about this.
 
 This is clearly a configuration problem and not a bug report. Your next
 step should be to try to start Apache directly, without the system
 start-up scripts.  If you want discuss it further in
 comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix, then I will try to find time to look at
 it.  However, the bug database is not the appropriate place,
 and we don't provide one-on-one support, so we'll have to end this
 conversation.
 
 Good luck.

 Quoting my phone number on the Subject: line seems to be some

 He has also sent me more than one email with similar tone.
