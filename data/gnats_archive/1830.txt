>Description:
From httpd.h:
  request_rec *next;            /* If we wind up getting redirected,
                                 * pointer to the request we redirected to.
  request_rec *prev;            /* If this is an internal redirect,
                                 * pointer to where we redirected *from*.
  request_rec *main;            /* If this is a sub_request (see request.h) 
                                 * pointer back to the main request.
(there appears to be no other documentation, which I guess is a bad sign in
itself)  Try as I might, I don't seem to ever be able to get these things set
to point to anything, so I have come to the conclussion that there must be a 
bug there somewhere, or that this is unsupported atm and is there for future
extension?

 See sub_req_lookup_uri, sub_req_lookup_file, and internal_redirect.  A
 grep would have found those.
