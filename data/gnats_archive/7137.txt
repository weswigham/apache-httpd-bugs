 "Brothers, the so-called professional, liberated black
 woman wants to have her cake and eat it too. Some of
 them have gone to college and earned degrees. She has
 entered the work force and is attempting to make an
 impact in corporate America and other areas of
 employment. She wants liberation on her job. She wants
 equality in the classroom. She wants to do what she
 wants to do, when she wants to do it, with whom she
 wants to do it. She wants liberation. I have no problem
 with that. More power to her. But I ask one simple
 question: WHY ARE WE STILL FOOTING THE BILL?" -
 Excerpt from Chapter Three: "What Have You Done For Me Lately?"
 ________________________________________________________
 "Brothers Beware: Games Black Women Play" is a book that
 pulls no punches when it details the many tricks and
 manipulative games for which black women are notorious.
 
 This book is an honest, no holds barred, uncensored
 discussion about dating in the African American community.
 
 The number of eligible black men is constantly decreasing.
 Therefore, black women are doing whatever is necessary to
 find and keep a good black man. Many of her secrets are
 exposed in this book.
 
 The author interviewed several black women who revealed
 many of the techniques used by Sisters to get what they
 want, and who they want, any time they want. These women
 were especially helpful on the hilarious chapter entitled:
 "Games Women Play On Each Other."
 
 The author had no need whatsoever to embellish -
 The TRUTH was definitely sensational enough.
