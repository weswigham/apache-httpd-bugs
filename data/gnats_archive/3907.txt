Win NT4, up to SP4 (incl) installed, Personal Web Server running-though I stopped it to install Apache.
>Description:
Check to see if you forgot to include something in the one exe file I downloaded this morn from your site.  When I click on Install Apache as Service (NT), 1) a window flashes open and then vanishes.  2) There are no files in CONF dir.  What happened to httpd.conf? 3) No error logs are generated, nothing in LOGs dir.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install and run the Win32 version
>Fix:
No, I hope you have.

 Overlook this error report.  I have both NT4 and Win95 on the same
 machine and installed Apache in C:\PF\Apache Group, to be able to use
 it from both.  Apparently Apache does not like that.  Uninstalled and
 reinstalled only in NT now.  Seems OK, but there are no visible
 indications that it is working in the background.  Will devote more
 time to this after I return from my vacation in June.  Thanks, Be well.
