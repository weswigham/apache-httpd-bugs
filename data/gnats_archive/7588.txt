>Description:
I'm getting a sytax error when trying to startssl.  I have mod_ssl-2.8.2 with apache_1.3.19.

Line 206:

LoadModule ssl_module libexec/libssl.so

"Syntax error on line 206 of /usr/local/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load libssl.so into server: ld.so.1: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd:
fatal: /usr/local/apache/libexec/libssl.so: open failed: No such file or
directory"

I have all the neccesary lib paths in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

I don't know what it is looking for to open.

I'm baffled!  I can't even get apache to compile using standard libs.  I have to use shared libs.  Using apache1.3.19/configure and I get a slew of undefined errors when try to compile httpd.  Is there a standard way of getting this to compile where it will work?

State-Changed-Why:
Can you verify that /usr/local/apache/libexec/libssl.so exists
and is recognized as a shared library?  Try running the command 
"file /usr/local/apache/libexec/libssl.so" and see what the
output is.

If there is a dependency of libssl.so which is not found you'll
need to contact the mod_ssl folks.  mod_ssl issues aren't 
supported from this bug tracking system.

I can't guess what your compile errors are when you try to
build httpd statically.  If they appear to have something to do
with mod_ssl or openssl then you should follow up with the
normal way to get help with mod_ssl problems (I don't know
what that is).  Otherwise, open a new bug report for the
compile errors and show actual commands you issued along with
the unexpected output.

Note that many Solaris users have problems because some of 
the required tools (ar, make, cc, etc.) are not in the
system-defined PATH, and PATH has to be customized before
Apache configure/build will complete.

Got it going!

  It was 64bit lib produced by openssl.  I created regular old static 32 and
it worked without running your configure script.  Openssl had a flaw in
there config script that I took out and ran it vice their "Configure
solaris64-sparcv9-cc" set-up.

Thanks.
