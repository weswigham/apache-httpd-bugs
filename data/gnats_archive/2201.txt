I just vistited your bugsite for the first time. I was hoping to get a list of 
known problems with my version of apache web server. However, the release is
not one of the search criteria.

Neither could I see a better place for reporting this difficulty.

 Unfortunately, the release is a freeform text field, and searching for
 bugs in "1.2.5" (for example) wouldn't show you everything in 1.2.5.  The
 system just isn't sophisticated enough to track when particular bugs are
 fixed in a manner that would make this sort of query useful.

State-Changed-Why:
As Dean said, this really isn't practical with the whole
structure of the current database.  Even if it was, we
really don't have the manpower to indicate in the PR
what versions are impacted.  Normally the reporter has no
idea, and they can be in various versions and fixed at
various times before or after they are reported.  The
CHANGES file of the most recent release is probably the
best place to find things that were changed between
releases, but it doesn't include everything.  Not all
bugs that are fixed are in the bug database either.
