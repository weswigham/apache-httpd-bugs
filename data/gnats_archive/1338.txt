>Description:
I've confirmed this on 3 machines -- Two are mine running Caldera Lite, the other is a RedHat 4.2 box.  Although the configuration states to start more than one server, only one will start at start time.

I have access to the RedHat server, which handles a very large amount of traffic (maxes out at 4mb/s) with ONLY ONE SERVER.

State-Changed-When: Thu Oct 30 09:02:57 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:

What are your "StartServers", "Max-/MinSparServers" and
"MaxClients" settings?
Do you really see only _one_ httpd process when listing
the processes via "ps"?
Are there any messages in the error.log?

 Lars,
 
    StartServers is 15.
    MinSpare is 15.   Max is 25.
    MaxClients is 150.
 
    I killed and restarted httpd and received:
 
 [Thu Oct 30 13:07:46 1997] httpd: caught SIGTERM, shutting down
 [Thu Oct 30 13:07:49 1997] created shared memory segment #128
 [Thu Oct 30 13:07:50 1997] Server configured -- resuming normal operations
 
 And there *IS* only one server running:
 
 [root@www httpd]# ps -x | grep httpd
  5787  ?  S    0:00 httpd 
  6012  p3 R    0:00 grep httpd 
 [root@www httpd]#

 Erm... please try "ps -ax | grep httpd".
 
 Without 'a', it only shows your processes.  All the child servers don't
 run as root so they don't show up.
