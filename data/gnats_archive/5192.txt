 Hi,
 
 Hope you may installed the apache 1.3.9 server as per
 the procedure which is given in /apache_1.3.9/INSTALL
 file. While you are 
     ./configure --prefix="PREFIX" 
 you have to mention the installation root in PREFIX
 string.
 
  eg: 
     ./configure --prefix="/usr/local/apache"
 
 and make, make install it.
 
 Step 1:
 After installation remove the double qoutes in the
 ServerRoot, DocumentRoot.
 
 eg., 
      ServerRoot "/usr/local/apache" as     
      ServerRoot /usr/local/apache
 and
      DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/htdocs" as
      DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs
 
 Step 2:
 Change the daemon in server startup file.(which is
 available at /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd and bundled with
 RH6.0)
 
 ie., 
 start)
      ...
      daemon /usr/local/bin/apachectl start
      ...
 
 (where apachectl is another file which is installed
 alongwith apache_1.3.9)
 
 step 3:
 reboot the system.
 
 Now automatically the apache_1.3.9 started. Check it
 with test-cgi.
 
 regards,
 
 visolve_apache.
