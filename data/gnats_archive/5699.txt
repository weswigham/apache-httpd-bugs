>Organization:
>Environment:
WindowsNT 4.0 + SP5, binary Apache distribution
>Description:
With SSI, I can only capture the output of commands internal to the interpreter, CMD.EXE (or a couple of replacements I've tried: 4NT.EXE and 4NTRT.EXE).  For example, this works nicely:
<!--#exec cmd="echo hi" --> (likewise any command internal to the interpreter)
but the following produces empty output (though the EXE does run):
<!--#exec cmd="c:\\winnt\\system32\\netstat.exe" -->
Similarly, I can run batch files, but if the batch file runs an external EXE, that EXE's output is lost.  For example, if the batch file includes the command:
"c:\winnt\system32\netstat.exe > v:\test.txt", netstat.exe does run and
the output file, v:\test.txt is created, but it is empty.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try <!--#exec cmd="c:\\winnt\\system32\\netstat.exe" -->
in a document under circumstances in which SSI's are enabled and expected to work.
>Fix:
If this problem arises because CMD.EXE runs as a DETACHED_PROCESS, perhaps starting it with CreateProcess() and SW_HIDE (instead) would help.

NOte: An option for a user-specified command interpreter for SSI's "#exec cmd=" would be nice (so we wouldn't be stuck with CMD.EXE). Please reply by email.
Thank you.
