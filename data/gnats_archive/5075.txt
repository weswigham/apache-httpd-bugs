>Description:
i was actually looking to figure out why #exec cgi, #exec cmd, and #include virtual
all were controlled by IncludesNoexec when i discovered that #include virtual
will allow cgi from ScriptAlias directories.  this gives me the control i'm looking
for (allow ssi to run cgi from known areas).  having this documented would be
very nice.  there are some problems with #include virtual (nested <html> tags and
the like) but it's better than thinking you have to allow #exec cmd to get text
based counters to work.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
i think that the wording in the mod_includes section should be modified to
indicate that #include virtual will invoke cgi if it is from a ScriptAlias
directory.
