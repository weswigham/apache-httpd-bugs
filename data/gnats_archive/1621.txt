>Description:
It appears that apache can't run a CGI script which has another script as
its interpreter, as specified in the shebang (#!) line.  They must point
to a true executable.  I'm fairly certain this hasn't always been the case.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try this:

File: /usr/local/bin/interpret.sh
#!/usr/bin/sh
echo "Content-type: text/plain"
echo
cat $1

File: /usr/local/etc/httpd/test.cgi
#!/usr/local/bin/interpret.sh
This is a test CGI
It worked!

If test.cgi is run from the command line, it works fine.  However, if run
as a script through Apache, it errors with an "Exec format error (errno = 8)"
in the error log.
>Fix:
Not sure how to fix it, but as a work around, you have to alter the CGI
shebang so that it calls the ultimate executable.  For instance:

Instead of '#!/usr/local/bin/interpret.sh', you have to use
'#!/usr/bin/sh /usr/local/bin/interpret.sh'.  Kind of a pain, but it
does work

 Apache really doesn't have too much to do with this on Unix.  The shell
 does it all...

 If you run test.cgi from within /bin/sh on the command line does it work?
