>Environment:
Machine:  HP 712/80
OS:       HP-UX 10.01
Compiler: gcc v. 2.7.2.1
Web:      Apache 1.2b1
>Description:
When compiling the httpd binary, it would consistantly fail.  After
selecting the desired modules in the src/Configuration file, I would run
the Configure script.  This guesses my OS correctly to be HP-UX 10.x.  
In the Makefile that is created the 'CFLAGS1' is set to '-DHPUX10'.  Then
I do a make.  The usual output looks like 'gcc -c   -O2 -DHPUX10   alloc.c'
All modules compile properly except for the 'http_mail.c'  On this module
the following is displayed:
        gcc -c   -O2 -DHPUX10   http_main.c
http_main.c: In function `lingering_close':
http_main.c:319: warning: passing arg 2 of `select' from incompatible pointer type
http_main.c:319: warning: passing arg 4 of `select' from incompatible pointer type
http_main.c: In function `child_main':
http_main.c:1468: warning: passing arg 2 of `select' from incompatible pointer type
http_main.c:1499: warning: passing arg 2 of `select' from incompatible pointer type
        gcc -c   -O2 -DHPUX10   http_core.c

Then when all the .o files are created, it fails on the actual compile of
the httpd binary.

To correct this problem, I edited the Makefile so that the 'CFLAGS1' is set
to '-DHPUX' instead of the HPUX10.  Once this was done all compiled correctly.
The web daemons have been up and stable for 7 days now.  Performance is 
excelent.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile the httpd daemon under HP-UX 10.01.
>Fix:
Chage the Configure script to use HPUX instead of HPUX10 for the cflags

State-Changed-Why:

We believe this was fixed in 1.2b3.  Can you confirm?
The exact configuration for HPUX is tricky due to multiple
variations among the OS releases and compiler releases.

State-Changed-Why:
Assuming the fix that was applied for HPUX fixed this.  I
can compile on HPUX 10.20 fine and people have reported
having no problems on 10.0x with later betas.
