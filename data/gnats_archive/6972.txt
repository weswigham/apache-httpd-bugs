>Organization:
>Environment:
OS: Win NT/2000, RedHat Linux 6.2
Patch: No
Compiler: VC++6.0 in Win32, gcc in Linux
>Description:
I am writing additional module for Apache server, which receive a data from client via POST request and write them to a file. The data received correctly,  but when I trying to write them to file on the server I received a NULL file descriptor (in Linux, in Win32 desriptor is correct, but fprintf of fwrite causes the system message "Application error") from ap_pfopen (or fopen) function. If I trying to read any file via these functions - all ok.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I can to try write this on CGI or PHP, but add-on module is more preferable rof me.

This sounds like a problem with your code or with the way

Apache.
