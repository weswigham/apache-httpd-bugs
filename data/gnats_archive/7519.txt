Windows NT Workstation 4.0sp6
Apache.org supplied binary
>Description:
In prior versions of Apache (1.3.17), script files that returned content of type text/plain would display as an HTML page. Now, the server offers to download the _output_ of scripts that return content of type text/plain.

I have made no changes to conf/mime.types or conf/magic. I have not added anything pertaining to text/plain to my httpd.conf file.

Files like "foo.txt" do display in the browser.
>How-To-Repeat:
run this:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
##
##  printenv -- demo CGI program which just prints its environment
##

print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
foreach $var (sort(keys(%ENV))) {
    $val = $ENV{$var};
    $val =~ s|\n|\\n|g;
    $val =~ s|"|\\"|g;
    print "${var}=\"${val}\"\n";
}

State-Changed-Why:

This is a browser issue, not a server issue.  Apache
can only set the mime type.  It can't tell the browser
what to do with that mime type.  You might be suffering
from a microsoft "feature" (BUG!):

Thanks for using Apache!

 This would doubtless explain why under 1.3.17 it worked as expected but does
 not under 1.3.19. Also, in some strange way, it did work once with IE 5.5
 and 1.3.19.
 
 While Microsoft code is generally crap, not all problems can be ascribed to
 them. Since the only thing that changed between working and not working, the
 simplest (ever hear of ocam's razor?) explanation is that there IS a problem
 with Apache 1.3.19's handling of text/plain.
 
 Please have the courtesy to reopen this bug and really take a look at it
 rather then blithely writing it off to a Microsoft browser bug. (You might
 want to investigate why conf/mime.types changed from earlier versions of
 Apache 1.3.1x.)
 
 Thank you and have a nice day!

State-Changed-Why:

At your request, I will reopen this.  However, there is 
really no possibility that Apache is mishandling this,
since Apache does nothing at all to "handle text/plain"
other than to send the header.  It is completely up
to the client to decide how to deal with things.

You almost surely have a configuration problem, 
either on the client or server side.  These types
of problems are much better dealt with in a user
support forum such as 
comp.infosystems.www.server.ms-windows

Anyway, I'll leave this open in case someone else wants
to contribute.

can you provide a URL that we can access that demonstrates this behaviour?

 I do not have access to the exact same platform that you are
 using; obviously, CGIs work just fine for a heck of a lot of other
 people.  So try to figure out what is going on in your case, being able to
 either access it ourselves or see exactly what headers are being returned
 would be a big help.

Comment-Added:
The sample location given is not returning a bogus mime header, it simply is dying before returning any headers.  So it has nothing to do with a bogus MIME type header.  So either the machine is setup incorrectly to execute the CGI properly or there is a bug preventing it from being executed properly.

Comment-Added:

This is IE specific behavior.  All of the header fields are
sythesiszed into what IE feels like doing at the moment.
No doubt there is a very subtle interaction between the
requests.  I'll look at your example against my testbench
of different versions and note what those discrepancies
are.  It seems the etag header has something to do with it,
but that's all I know thus far.
