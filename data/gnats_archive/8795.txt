Irrelevant.
>Description:
1) README.bindist gives the wrong URL for reporting bugs.
  Listed:  http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html
  Correct: http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html

2) The file README-WIN.TXT refers to http://httpd.apache.org/docs/windows.html, which gives instructions that do not apply to the Cygwin release. Actually the README-WIN.TXT information is either inapplicable or redundant.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
1) Replace the URL.
2) Hunt down the Windows-specific parts of README-WIN.TXT and add the information for Cygwin (mostly this means adding appropriate URLs).

 point 1) is not os-windows specific.
 
 point 2) is only concerning the Win32 native port of Apache.
 
 Cygwin is considered something hybrid, not UNIX, not Windows. That's
 why we introduced an *own* OS identified for the server software
 header.
 
 Please close this issue.
