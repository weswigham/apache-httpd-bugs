>Description:
I have a virtual host which uses a different directory for logs.
every time I run logrotate by crontab, it reports duplicate
log, like this,
/etc/cron.daily/logrotate:

error: domains:14 duplicate log entry for /xxx....../error_log
>How-To-Repeat:
creates a virtual host, and for that host, use a different log dir
for access and error logs. then run your crontab daily, which
includes apache.
>Fix:
it is not a problem of logrotate, I am pretty sure about that.

State-Changed-Why:
The error you are complaining about comes from logrotate.  That is not an Apache program and is not included with Apache.  We can do nothing about it...
