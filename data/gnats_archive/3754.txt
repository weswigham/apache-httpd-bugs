>Environment:
winnt sp4, using dlls from ie5b2 and office 2000...
>Description:
Any directory under NT called header* won't appear in the index of the upper directory.

For example, my doc root is / and i have a dir called /header

/header wont appear in the index....  this is the same for files called header*

I tested this on FreeBSD with 1.3.3 and it does not occur.

I tested this on an NTFS partition.... but I don't think that matters too much
>How-To-Repeat:
See description, as i dont have a static ip
>Fix:
I don't memorize source code, otherwise I would just submit the fixed source.... heh, have fun.... thanks guys!

State-Changed-When: Sat Jan 23 20:59:43 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Please see the IndexIgnore directive.  You most likely have
it set to something including HEADER* which, logically,
stops that from being shown.
