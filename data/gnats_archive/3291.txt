>Description:
I have configured and compiled apache1.3.3. Configured it with:

./configure --prefix=/home/www --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a \
--enable-shared=php3 --enable-module=most --enable-module=log_agent \
--enable-module=log_referer --enable-module=usertrack --enable-module=mmap_static \
--with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl --enable-shared=max

Then I compiled it. When I try to invoked apachectl start it results in 
this error:


Syntax error on line 26 of /home/www/etc/apache/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /home/www/libexec/mod_mmap_static.so into server: ld.so.1: /home/www/sbin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /home/www/libexec/mod_mmap_static.so: symbol ap_null_cleanup: referenced symbol not found
/home/www/sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started



What in the world am I doing wrong. I have even commmented out all the added
modules and it still gives me errors.

State-Changed-Why:
If you compile with just:
    ./configure --prefix=/home/www  --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max

Does it give the same problem?

Are you _sure_ there are no old modules in the installatio ntree
previous versions of Apache that could be being used?

 That doesn't make sense to me.

 Actually, if you add ....--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE to 
 
 ./configure --prefix=/home/www --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a 
 --enable-shared=php3 --enable-module=most --enable-module=log_agent 
 --enable-module=log_referer --enable-module=usertrack 
 --enable-module=mmap_static --with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl --enable-shared=max 
 
 
 Which is the original configuration. It will work just fine.
 
 Thank you for your help,

 Oh, it _DOES_ make sense when we take into account that he is using Solaris (a
 SVR4 platform) and not GCC. I don't know, but perhaps his WorkShop compiler
 links httpd (or calls the linker) httpd differently then GCC does. Especially
 the symbol exporting flag is missing. But with --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE this
 is not needed, because with a libhttpd.so the functions are available to the
 DSOs. So, the question is: What flag do we have to provide to the WorkShop
 compiler to force him to export the symbols of httpd?  Currently under Solaris
 we have LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT="", but perhaps we need something here for the
 non-GCC situation.  At least we have some more PRs which seems to be exactly
 the same problem. They are under Solaris and I couldn't find the problem under
 my setup (Solaris+gcc).

Apparently the fix is to add "--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE"
to the ./configure options.
