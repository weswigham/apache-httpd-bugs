>Description:
The file ./INSTALL doesn't document what --exec-prefix is for or 
what it does.  

INSTALL says only:
    Use the --prefix=PREFIX and --exec-prefix=EPREFIX options to
    configure Apache to use a particular installation prefix.

Specifically, it is not clear what the distinct options are used
for (executables only? executables and libraries? maybe configuration
files too?).




>How-To-Repeat:
n/a
>Fix:
Say specifically what --exec-prefix and --prefix are used for.  
(Or, if INSTALL isn't the primary documentation and I should be
looking elsewhere, have INSTALL point the user to that other
documentation.)
