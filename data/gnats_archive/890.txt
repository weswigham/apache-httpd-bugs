>Description:
I want to browse some documents offline. When I access them the first time,
go offline, clean Netscape-cache and go to the site again, it works
(most of the time). If I go on-line again, press "reload" in Netscape, go
offline again, then the proxy responds with a "host not found" error.

State-Changed-Why:

If you press 'reload' in Netscape it requests a non-cache
version of the document by sending a 'no-cache' header
and the proxy tries to fetch the document from the
original server...

Currently there is no way to enforce an offline-mode of
the proxy.
