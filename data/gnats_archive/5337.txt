Linux 2.2.15, RedHat 6.1 i386
>Description:
I have the following
ProxyRemote * http://host:port/
NoProxy .intranet.domain www.hostname www.hostname2

The intenet is that *only* machines in the .intranet.domain and those specificly listed be available to proxy users (I'm chaining proxy servers, and want to limit access on the local end of the link).  In this case, if the ProxyRemote host isn't listening on the port, the local proxy connects directly to the site
even if it *isn't* in the NoProxy line after printing an error for connection refused if the ProxyRemote service isn't up.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add a ProxyRemote line for everything pointing to localhost on a
port that isn't being serviced.  Add a NoProxy statement for a limited set of
machines, then use the proxy to connect to something not in the NoProxy list.
>Fix:
Not at this time.
