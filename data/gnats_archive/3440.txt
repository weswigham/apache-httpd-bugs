>Description:
I am trying to connect via Frontpage to an Apache 1.3.3 server complied with mod_frontpage and mod_proxy, 
using a local Apache 1.3.3 server compiled with mod_proxy (only) as proxy :

Frontpage/98 gives the following error when enabling proxy :

from syslog :
Nov 20 15:36:36 goodboy Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions: Errore #60003 Messaggio: Tentativo di es
guire l'interprete Smart HTML sulla pagina non in formato HTML "". (userid 923)
(Translates to : Error #60003 trying to execute Smart HTML interpreter on 
a non HTML page "" )

Frontpage works correclty when an Apache/frontpage proxy server is NOT selected 
or when I specify Netscape proxy server in Frontpage/98.

I noticed these two differences  in the log file, the first one is produced 
when connecting with no proxy enabled in Frontpage/98, the second three lines 
are produced with an Apache 1.3.3/proxy/with fronptage_mod  enabled in 
Frontpage/98.

In the access_log entry below please notice the last line :

"POST /_vti_bin/shtml.exe/_vti_rp HTTP/1.0"

should be :
"POST /_vti_bin/shtml.exe/_vti_rpc HTTP/1.0"

Maybe the URL is not passed correctly from the proxy module ?


Excerpt from access_log on the proxy server (compiled with mod_proxy and mod_frontpage) :

uni-port2-148 - - [21/Nov/1998:15:23:32 +0100] "POST /_vti_bin/shtml.exe/_vti_rpc HTTP/1.0" 200 227
uni-port2-148 - - [21/Nov/1998:15:23:32 +0100] "POST /_vti_bin/_vti_aut/author.exe HTTP/1.0" 401 401

With mod_frontpage.c and mod_proxy :
uni-port2-148 - - [21/Nov/1998:15:17:52 +0100] "GET /_vti_inf.html HTTP/1.0" 200 1716
uni-port2-148 - - [21/Nov/1998:15:17:53 +0100] "POST /_vti_bin/shtml.exe/_vti_rp HTTP/1.0" 200 175


The frontpage module/patch to Apache-1.3.3 was downloaded from :
ftp://www.rtr.com/pub/apache130/fp-patch-apache_1.3.3.tar.Z
(see http://www.rtr.com/fpsupport/downloadApache130.htm)

This behaviour appeared in version Apache-1.3.0 and above, it worked OK in 1.2.X.

If you need further details I will be glad to provide more information.
