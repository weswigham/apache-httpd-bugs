>Description:
When using DirectoryIndex with a CGI script at an absolute URI the script is called without PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED information. Without this it is impossible for the script to present a directory idex. (Note that no arguments with path informaton are passed to the script. Nor is the working directory set to the path.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure DirectoryIndex for a given location. Eg,

<Location />
Options Indexes
DirectoryIndex /cgi-bin/index.pl
</Location>

Created index.pl with the code

#!/usr/bin/perl
use Data::Dumper;
print "content-type: text/html\n\n<pre>", Dumper( \@ARGV, \%ENV ), "</pre>";

Now use the URL

http://localhost/

and you will see that the environment variable dump does not include the PATH_INFO or PATH_TRANSLATED variables.
>Fix:
No. I am happy to look into fixing it if this would help. I assume the problem is in mod_autoindex, but I do not know enough about the Apache code base to debug this further without quite some effort.

 The problem is not with mod_autoindex, but with mod_dir's handling of the
 internal redirect. Mod_dir knows nothing about the files listed in
 DirectoryIndex: It just tries to do an internal redirect to each file
 listed until one succeeds. The internal redirect looks different than
 mod_include's, for example, in that mod_include knows when it is calling a
 CGI script and so sets the redirect's environment by calling
 
         ap_add_common_vars(r);
         ap_add_cgi_vars(r);
 
 Mod_dir's does not have this foreknowledge and so (ultimately) only calls
 
         ap_add_common_vars(r);
 
 which does not setup PATH_INFO, etc.
 
 From what I can tell from reading the code so far is that mod_dir needs a
 special internal redirect is more aware of the parent environment. That is
 the directory's uri is the path info to the script at the given directory
 index.
