>Environment:
NT 4.0 SP 6
>Description:
I use IE 5.5.  I have the language preferences set for en-us, fr, eo.  When I installed Apache and went to http://localhost/, I received the default start page in French.  Per RFC 1766 and successors, the language identifier should be tokenized at the hyphen, and matched by whole tokens; e.g., a page in English (en) should match a request for US English (en-us).
>How-To-Repeat:
Set language preferences to en-us, fr.  Go to any site with multiple language pages, such as a new installation with the default pages.
>Fix:
Correct the language comparison code.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm not an expert in this area, and I didn't write the
relevant code, but I believe you are wrong in your
analysis of the standards.  See
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4
and for a great analysis,

Thanks for using Apache!
