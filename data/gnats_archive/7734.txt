OpenBSD enetbsd 2.8 ENETBSD#3 i386
jiwi@Enetbsd:/usr/local/apache/logs# gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-unknown-openbsd2.8/2.95.3/specs
gcc version 2.95.3 19991030 (prerelease)
>Description:
I have a entry in my /etc/hosts thay says: "127.0.0.1  enetbsd.something.org"

My apache only binds to a "live ip", not 127.0.0.1. 
However, if I remove that "127.0.0.1 enetbsd.something.org" from /etc/hosts (still
having "127.0.0.1   localhost" ofcoz),

jiwi@Enetbsd:/usr/local/apache/logs# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
Memory fault

And when I add it again:

jiwi@Enetbsd:/usr/local/apache/logs# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd started

The thing is, 127.0.0.1 is never used in my httpd.conf, and enetbsd.something.org
is for sure _never_ used in my httpd.conf either.

State-Changed-Why:
The broken 1.3.19 logic deals with looking up the address
of the current machine.

This is fixed in CVS and will be in the next release of 
Apache 1.3.x.

Thanks for using Apache.
