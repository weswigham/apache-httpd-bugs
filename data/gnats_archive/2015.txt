IconsAreLinks are enabled and viewing from a text browser.
>Description:
In a direcotry index with IconsAreLInks, the link for the icon is
separate from the link for the filename, and multiple spaces
compressed in viewers. (being pedantic)

When browsing a server-generated directory listing with a text-browser (such as
lynx) and IconsAreLinks is enabled, 'down' must be hit twice to go from file to
file.  I can see no reason to print out "</A>", and another 'anchor' between the
icon and filename.

Plus, (this may be a lynx bug), multiple spaces from an ALT="   " tag in a
directory listing are compressed to one space, so why not use " ? " instead of
"   " as the semantics from the viewing point are the same?
>How-To-Repeat:
http://cis.tamu.edu/systems/unix/source/ is a (currently, 1998-Mar-30) unpatched
example, repetition is trivial by enabling "IndexOptions IconsAreLinks" and
viewing with lynx or (presumably) other browser that allows keyboard navigation.

Because otherwise you have this ugly blue underscore on graphical browsers
between your icon and your text.
