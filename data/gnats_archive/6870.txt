>Environment:
OS of the server : NT 
APACHE 1.3.14 downloaded already compiled
>Description:
We use HTML pages  to connect to an interbase 5 database thru a DLL writen in Delphi 5.
We have no pb if we use APACHE 1.3.14 started in a dos windows. 

When we install APACHE as a service  (on a server NT 4.0  SP5)it seems like the database is not founded, or the datas not reached, with a delphi message coming from our DLL : unknown user or alias missing -DBDATA- .
No message in Access.log or error.log files.
Our datas and HTML pages are installed on an other disk than Apache.

>How-To-Repeat:
I can give you our HTTPD.conf , our DLL 
>Fix:
no

State-Changed-Why:

It seems that Apache does not have the necessary privileges
in needs to access the database when running as a service.
Please see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/win_service.html

 We used Apache 1.3.12,   and Interbase 5.5  and have uninstalled every
 thing.
 Apache 1.3.14 and  Interbase 6.0 are now installed.
 The problem was unchanged .
 The Interbase service are well launched when Apache Service is started.
 The access thru à Delphi .DLL (via HTML pages) to  our Interbase database is
 unsuccessfull, it seems like if
 the Alias to our database was not active. But when we do an access thru an
 Interbase explorer, the
 database and the alias is accepted !!!.
 When Apache is launched in a dos windows, all is OK.
 We can join our Http.conf translated in French , and a few lines of our
 Delphi source if necessary.
 Bests wishes for the new year.
