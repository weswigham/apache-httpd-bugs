>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
IRIX 6.5
Netscape 4.61
JServ 1.1 
TomCat 3.1 Milestone M1
JSDK2.0
JDK 1.2.1 (SGI)
>Description:
This code :
	HttpSession session = req.getSession(false);
	if (session == null) 
	    session = req.getSession(true);
produces new SessionIDs every time
The funny thing is that I also tried encodeUrl(..) with 
"Dont accept cookies" in Netscape, but it doesnt encode the SessionId in the URL.
If I contact tomcat directly (via 8080 port) it works with cookies but not with 
encodeUrl(..)

We have compiled mod_jserv.so and placed it in the libexec/ (Apache 1.3.11 with DSO)
and everything else works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
see code and enviroment
>Fix:
I've heard that under linux this problem disapears with the precompiled mod_jserv
but i havent found one for SGI/IRIX 6.5.5
