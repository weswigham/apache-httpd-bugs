>Description:
"AllowOverride FileInfo" enables 21 directives:
ErrorDocument, DefaultType; Action; Redirect*; Header;
Add*, ForceType, SetHandler; LanguagePriority; Rewrite*;
CookieTracking

I think FileInfo is too coarse.
>How-To-Repeat:
grep OR_FILEINFO `find * -name '*.c'`
>Fix:
NCSA httpd 1.5 introduced "AllowOverride Redirect"
I would like to add "AllowOverride Redirect" to Apache and have it
apply to mod_alias:Redirect* and mod_rewrite:Rewrite*, if approved.
Perhaps AuthConfig and Indexes should be split too?

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for the suggestion.  We've been talking about
breaking up the Override stuff into something more
rational and site-or-module-configurable.  I'm marking this
PR as 'suspended' so it will be considered when we get
around to the next rash of feature consideration.  Thanks!
