>Description:
I use mod_auth_digest to protect a forum CGI script.

This is in httpd.conf:

<Location "/cgi-bin/forum.pl">
    AuthName private
    AuthType Digest
    AuthDigestDomain /cgi-bin/forum.pl
    AuthDigestFile /etc/httpd/conf/userdb.digest
    AuthDigestGroupFile /etc/httpd/conf/groupdb
    AuthDigestNonceLifetime 900
    Require group forum
</Location>

As a client I use Mozilla 0.9.8. Authentication works when I move around the
forum and read postings, all GET requests. However, when I try to post a new
message, Mozilla pops up the authentication dialog and I have to type in the
username and password AGAIN. A "password mismatch" line is added to error_log.
After typing in the credentials again, the POST request works, but you have to
repeat them for every new POST request.

While this is simply annoying in a forum context, it might seriously
hurt when transferring larger files with POST requests (think WebDAV).
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create a URL protected by digest authentication with mod_auth_digest.
2. GET the URL to set up your browser with the necessary credentials.
3. POST to the URL.

State-Changed-Why:

I haven't tested this myself, but my best guess would be
that this is a client problem.  Could you do one of the
following:

1. Try it in IE6 or another browser known to support
the most recent digest spec.

2. Put a sniffer on the line and see if mozilla is
really sending the right thing.

Thanks!

 Sorry, I don't have IE6. Does Opera for Linux support it ?

 This is what ethereal sniffed, I only include the auth headers:
 (I am not a digest auth expert, so unfortuantely I can't tell
 if there's anything suspicious going on.)
