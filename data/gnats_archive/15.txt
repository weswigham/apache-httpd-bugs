>Description:
Attempting to use graceful restarts with -USR1 functionality causes some
instability - repeated -USR1's can fail, and a USR1 followed by a HUP kills
the server dead.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
the
following code can be used to test it

  while :
  do
   kill -USR1 pid
  done

On both Linux and IRIX I can get this to give a failed assertion in the
listener code (it might not affect non-listener systems, I suppose).
>Fix:
an easy fix seems to be to ignore USR1 during a restart, though that wouldn't
fix the USR1-HUP interaction problem.%0
