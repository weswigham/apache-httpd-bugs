>Environment:
Solaris-6 x86
>Description:
There appears to be no way to configure the Apache server such that it will
create a log entry when a person successfully logs in.
The server does create an entry in the error log when a person is denied
access.

Why this is important:
I need to be able to tell how many concurrent logins are active for a given
account.
This is necessary to prevent the accounts from being raided when someone
posts the account information to a "password" site.
This is a problem common to all pay sites.

Why access log scanning does not work:
The access logs can be scanned for information such as multiple IP addresses
accessing the site within a given time frame but this has serious limitations.
Some users can have their IP address change with every request because of
the service they use (AOL, etc.).

Cookies won't work either for the same reason.  There is not a strict 1:1
relationship between cookies and athorizations.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Since there are several authorization modules, it would be best if this
could be done via a change to the mod_log_config module.
This assumes that mod_log_config has access to the status of an
authorization event.

State-Changed-Why:
Every time a user gets a restricted document, they "log in".
It is completely in the browser; Apache requires the
authentication for every request.  If it doesn't get it,
it sends a 401 and the browser prompts the user.

However, even if the user has "logged in" the browser can decide
not to send it in a particular situation, or it can decide
to send it just because it thinks it should.

So there is no concept of "logging in" for Apache to
know about since it is entirely a client side operation.

 Marc,
 Thanks for the education.  You can close this one.
 That was a great explanation.  It clears up a lot of
 things for me.  My appologies for submitting a non-bug.
