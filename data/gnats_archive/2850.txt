Solaris 2.5[.1] SPARC, gcc 2.7.2.1

Whenever I restarted the server (gracefully), the error log showed up to two
entries "long lost child came home!" after "resuming normal operation".
Is this normal or a bug?
I built with standard configure on Solaris. The httpd.conf settings are
MinSpareServers 2
MaxSpareServers 7
StartServers 2
MaxClients 30

 Do you use any piped logs?
 
 Before doing a restart can you capture "/usr/ucb/ps -auxwww" output, then
 do the restart... look at the log to find the pids of the long lost
 children, and find out what they were from the ps output?
 
 Thanks
 Dean

 The PIDs for the "long lost child"ren refer to the programs handling
 piped CustomLogs, not to forked httpd processed. Thus the proplem is solved.

 Damn I thought I fixed this bug... thanks, it should be easy to reproduce
 now.
