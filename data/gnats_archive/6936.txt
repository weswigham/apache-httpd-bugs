>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
os/2 warp 4.0, gcc 2.8.1 with EMX 0.9d fix 3
>Description:
The ap_os_case_canonical_filename() in os2_utils.c remove trailing
slash from filename. And get_path_info(request_rec *r) place
path without trailing slash to r->path_info. This is incompatible for
other operating systems and i have many problems with cvsweb.cgi.
Also ap_add_cgi_vars() use r->path_info to build script name from
r->uri. Without trailing slash in path_info it create invalid
script_name :(
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www/cgi-bin/printenv/my_test_cgi/

results:

REQUEST_URI="/cgi-bin/printenv/my_test_cgi/"
PATH_INFO="/my_test_cgi"
SCRIPT_NAME="/cgi-bin/printenv/my_test_cgi"
>Fix:
May be remove all convertations from os2 version 
ap_os_case_canonical_filename() excepting "\" to "/"? Like this:

PI_EXPORT(char *)ap_os_case_canonical_filename(pool *pPool, const char *szFile)
{
    char buf[HUGE_STRING_LEN];
    int rc, len; 
    char *pos;
    
    strcpy(buf, szFile);
   

/* Switch backslashes to forward */
    for (pos=buf; *pos; pos++)
        if (*pos == '\\')
            *pos = '/';
    
    return ap_pstrdup(pPool, buf);
}
