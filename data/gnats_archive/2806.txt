>Description:
If a file has the extension .cgi.html it is mistaken as a CGI and
not a HTML file.

Example:

If you have a a file called helpdesk.cgi.html and try to access it you
get a Forbidden error message, if you rename it to helpdesk.cgi.moo.html
it works fine, likewise if you rename it to helpdesk.commongi.html it
works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file called helpdesk.cgi.html and try and look at it in a 
browser, then try renaming it to helpdesk.comongi.html and look at 
it again.
>Fix:
Appears to be a problem in the way your parsing the filename extensions
for the relevant handler.

State-Changed-Why:
The current behaviour is correct.  Multiple filename
extensions _are_ supposed to be listened to.  If you have
an AddHandler for .cgi files, and a MIME type for
.html files, then both the handler and the MIME type will
be used.
