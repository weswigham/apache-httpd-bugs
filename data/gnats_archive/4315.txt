>Description:
Using a SetEnv for TZ, #echo var="LAST_MODIFIED" does not honor TZ. In our 
case, the server is for a :US/Pacific customer, and the machine is located in 
:US/Central.  CGI programs report the correct TZ, but in static documents
with #echo, the info is replaced with (currently) CDT date/time.  I assume
other date/time #echo substitutions have the same problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
From httpd.conf:
<VirtualHost socaltip.lerctr.org>                                            
        User socaltip                                                        
        Group socaltip                                                       
        SetEnv TZ :US/Pacific                                                
        ServerAdmin socaltip@lerctr.org                                      
        DocumentRoot /home3/socaltip/public_html                             
        ServerName socaltip.lerctr.org                                       
        ErrorLog /var/opt/httpd/logs/socaltip.lerctr.org-error_log           
        CustomLog /var/opt/httpd/logs/socaltip.lerctr.org-access_log combined
        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home3/socaltip/cgi/                           
</VirtualHost>

RC scripts use /etc/TIMEZONE to set TZ for the system to :US/Central
