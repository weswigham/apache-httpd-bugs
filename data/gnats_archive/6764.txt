apache
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.10, SuSE 6.2, compiler not used
>Description:
the problem is to make Description on fancy index comfortable.
if i say 'AddDescription "foo" */foo', then the files in the directory foo
will  descripte as "foo" too.
i can fix this with 'AddDescription "-" */foo/*' befor above statement. so every file has a '-' as description. mmh. on apache 1.3.6 it worked better, t think.

an other problem is this:
  'AddDescription "foo" */foo'
  'AddDescription "foobar" */foo/foobar'

now the directory */foo/foobar has the description "foo" and not "foobar".
if i turn the statements, it work.

maybe you can turn back to the configuration of older apache version. 1.3.6 or so.

bye, falk.
