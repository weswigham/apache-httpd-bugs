running the port apache-1.3.12+php3.0.15	
>Description:
I run analog to get a good view of the stats on my web page I noticed that since I upgraded the logs have been out by up to 15 hours.

I roll my log files every night at midnight and keep 7 previous logs to get a weekly report.

I noticed in my first log it had 50 entries from the day before not a minute or two out but 15 hours out.

If I am not wrong the date and time in the log file is when the machine received the request for the data not when it was sent.


I am also not using any custom log I just use the pre-setup combined log for my access log.

below I have included a section of my log file you will see the correct time and date as 12/Mar as this log was roled over at 23:59 on the 11/Mar

in the middle of this you will see a time and date for 11/Mar/09:45.	
So I am wondering how this is happening.	
>How-To-Repeat:
I am not sure how to recreate it?
