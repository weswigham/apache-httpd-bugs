Unix
>Description:
Shouldn't the parent ends of the file descriptors be closed unconditionally in the child between fork and exec?  Or is there an invariant that if attr->child_in is not set, then attr->parent_in is also not set, or is not a pipe?  If that's the case, a comment should mention that invariant.  Right now, the code looks like it might be wrong if the child descriptors aren't set, but it doesn't mention under what circumstances that might be the case.  (Or maybe the parent_in etc. can be 0-2?)

>How-To-Repeat:
No problem observed, just theoretical.

State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended
State-Changed-By: jerenkrantz
State-Changed-When: Sun Feb 17 22:43:33 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
I think for now that this is a fair assumption to
make - that is, that the parent pipe is only accessible
when the child pipe is valid.

If you can come up with a case where this assumption
is invalid, please post to the appropriate mailing lists.
For now, I will suspend this PR.
