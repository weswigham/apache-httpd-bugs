Ignore the hostname, its not real!
>Description:
Out The Box(TM) Apache 1.2.6 gives the error:
Incompatible pointer type assignment
strp = &fb->outbase[fb->outchunk + i];
in buff.c at line 263.

Using Digital Unix compiler (cc not gcc), sorry.

I'm not really a hacker to any degree, hence the compile from the box, but it
is similar to imap.c pointer problem in 1.2.5.

I can try to play with it here if you don't have a similar setup at your end.

 Is it a warning only?  If so ignore it.  Otherwise here's a patch that
 should fix it.
