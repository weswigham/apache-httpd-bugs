>Environment:
OS X 10.1 - Darwin
>Description:
With release 10.1 of OS X, Apache will not link during make. Tested with Apache 1.3.19 and 1.3.20. Config files have to be modified to drop modules or enambe the creation of two-level namespace executables. 

The error happens under:
cc  -bundle -undefined suppress -o mod_vhost_alias.so mod_vhost_alias.lo 
/usr/bin/ld: -undefined error must be used when -twolevel_namespace is in effect
