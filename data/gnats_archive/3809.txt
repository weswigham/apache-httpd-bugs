>Environment:
This is BSDI 4.0, using all the default tools supplied. (Except perhaps perl,
updated to 5.004_04)
>Description:
This is a really silly, stupid problem, which is thankfully easy to fix (I think)

The problem is that BSDI's tar does NOT support the -h flag, which the Makefile.tmpl
has hard-coded within. The causes apache to build just fine, but give an error
on install.

This is just one of those annoying little quirks that makes a package look
poorly assembled, which really bugs me because I know in my heart that apache is
by far the most superior web server available. I've flagged this as critical
because it makes apache look poor, when I think it should look to be the best
there is.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download apache 1.3.4 tarfile to BSDI 4.0 box. Untar.

cd apache-1.3.4

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
make
make install

On the last command, you will see tar complain and halt the install
>Fix:
Uhm.... stick the tar flags in a variable, say... TAR_FLAGS and have the autoconf
fill in an appropriate value based on target platform.
