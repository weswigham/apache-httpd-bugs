 Erm... why do you say that?
 
 It is in HTML, HTML supports & encoding.
 
 Example from HTML4 spec:
 
   Authors should use "&amp;" (ASCII decimal 38) instead of "&" to avoid
   confusion with the beginning of a character reference (entity reference
   open delimiter). Authors should also use "&amp;" in attribute values
   since character references are allowed within CDATA attribute values.
