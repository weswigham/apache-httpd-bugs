Linux Slackware 3.5
>Description:
It's not a big problem I think but everything i got in the newsgroups couldn't solve the problem. I wanted to use the module to correct the spelling of hyperlinks within a high size of pages (you start the first page but some pics aren't displayed, because their filenames are writen in different ways in the link and in the directory structure.) At the Linux (Slackware 3.5) it works great. I've tried to compile it into the programm and to use it as ACPI modules. Nothing worked. 
Please help me !!!! (I've just started learning Linux)!!!!!!!!!

(THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HELP)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>Fix:
Have i left some modules which ware required ? (I've started the module in the httpd.conf)

 What is the bug you are reporting exactly? (remember that the PR
 database is only for bug reports.)
 
 Are you trying to use mod_speling for fixing capitalization, except
 that it isn't doing anything on your server? Make sure that
 CheckSpelling is turned on as is described in the Apache manual. Does
 this fix yur problem?
