>Environment:
running Redhat Linux 5.0 compiled with gcc
>Description:
the system seems to run normally, except that the servers
gradually die off, turning from "waiting for connection" 
to "open slot" on the scoreboard.  once they stop
listening they don't appear to wake up again, except that
a graceful restart resets them to the full number.
the parameters of the httpd.conf are:

Timeout 100
KeepAlive On
KeepAliveTimeout 15
MinSpareServers 20
MaxSpareServers 200
StartServers 50
MaxClients 500 (compiled with HARD_SERVER_LIMIT=512)
MaxRequestsPerChild 30

this is a Pentium II 233 Mhz with 256 MB of ram.  I set the 
server parameters high because we are expecting alot of
traffic.  the current vmstat (no servers dead) is

procs                  memory    swap        io    system         cpu
 r b w  swpd  free  buff cache  si  so   bi   bo   in   cs  us  sy  id
 0 0 0     0 73740 122340 27020   0   0    3    0  109   12   0   0 100 

i suppose i can watch constantly and do graceful restarts all day
long, but is there something basically wrong here i'm doing.
thank you for your time in advance

 So you don't see any problems from the behaviour that appears
 incorrect?
 
 What exactly do you see, with numbers?  How many total servers running
 when it is started?  How many in use?
 
 How many are running a while later?  How many are in use?
 
 Are you sure you aren't just seeing it naturally moving towards
 the "proper" number of servers for your config?  
 
 If you don't have enough traffic to keep 50 servers, then of course
 the numbe rwill drop as servers reach maxrequestsperchild and die.

 thank your sympathetic response to my probably
 less than brilliant question.  your intuition
 is correct that we are running less demand at
 first that even the 50 servers at startup.  if
 there are any dynamic response problems as
 traffic increases i'll let you know.
