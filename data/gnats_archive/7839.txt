    I had Apache Web server installed successfully. After that I had jserv installed in the compact mode, allowing it to automatically configure everything.

directory. All other configurations on Zone.properties and the repositries have been made correctly. 
    Please help me, so that I can run servlets on my server.

State-Changed-Why:
jserv is a dead project.

your best bet is to try Tomcat (like you should have in the first place) or try sending email to the jserv-user mailing list.

 Sir,
 I had Apache Web server installed successfully. After that I had jserv installed in the compact mode, allowing it to automatically configure everything. But after the installation, the web server is not running. It shows the error that it cannot load the module Apachejservmodule.dll from the modules
 directory. All other configurations on Zone.properties and the repositries have been made correctly. 
     Please help me, so that I can run servlets on my server.
                  Thanking You,
              Stanley Varghese Samuel
