Chinese Windows 98 Second Edition
>Description:
I'm using the chinese windows 98 second edition and apache server 1.3.20.
I've found that sometimes if my filename is in chinese, apache will return error code 403, access forbidden, but not always, just most likely.
for example, if the filename(not including the file extension) is:

0xB9, 0x4C   (%b9L) (chinese character = "¹L")
or
0xAC, 0x50   (%acP) (chinese character = "¬P")
>How-To-Repeat:
just create any file contain the characters 0xB9, 0x4C or 0xAC, 0x50, and try to access from apache server.
