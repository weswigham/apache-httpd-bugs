>Description:
The "Upgrading to 2.0 from 1.3"-page, found on e.g.:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/upgrading.html
mentions:

==
The CacheNegotiatedDocs directive now takes the argument on or off. Existing instances of CacheNegotiatedDocs should be replaced with
CachNegotiatedDocs on. 
==

Note that the last keyword, "CachNegotiatedDocs", is missing an "e" - making
it "CacheNegotiatedDocs" instead of "CachNegotiatedDocs".

This is a pretty small typo, but my concern is related to the possibility of
people doing some unconcerned "cut-n-paste" from the documentation.
>How-To-Repeat:
lynx -source http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/upgrading.html | grep "CachNegotiatedDocs"
>Fix:
s/CachNegotiatedDocs/CacheNegotiatedDocs/
