>Description:
As you all know, it is easy to setup a "CustomLog" to log to an application.  Eg.

CustomLog "| /usr/bin/myscript.pl" "%h" etc..

Now, all works well if this perl script is okay.  However when the application fails, apache tries to restart it. (ie. myscript.pl keeps popping up as a new process all the time).

After some time, apache freezes completely and is unusable.  The rest of the system remains fine.	
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a customlog directive to a program (eg. a perl script) which does not work properly and returns error.
>Fix:
Nope.

What do you mean by "does not work properly"?  Please give
an example logging script that can be used to reproduce this.

 Sure,
 
 If you have a perl script as such:
 
 #!/usr/local/bin/perl
 #
 # Do something bad
 require 'doesnt-exist';
 
 Then reference this perl script in a customlog line:  Eg.
 
 CustomLog "| /usr/bin/myperl.pl" "%h"
 
 Apache normally starts ONE copy of the perl script.  However because this perl
 script bombs out, it keeps trying to restart the perl script (everytime it tries
 to log a hit as defined in the CustomLog).  Eventually we had the maximum number
 of apache processes running and apache stopped responding to any requests.
