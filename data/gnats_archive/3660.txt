>Release:        1.3.4
>Environment:
Micro$oft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation (Build 1381)
Service Pack 4
Cold Fusion 3.1.1 Pro
>Description:
Upgraded from Apache 1.3.3 (Win32) to 1.3.4 (Win32). 
Tried loading ApacheModuleColdFusion.dll from Allaire.com
Recieved Error: "The Procedure entry point_ap_table_set@12 could not
be located in the dynamic link library ApacheCore.dll"
>How-To-Repeat:
Load ApacheModuleColdFusion.dll via httpd.conf with Apache 1.3.4 available at:
ftp://ftp.allaire.com/old/incoming/Apache132stubs/cf311/ApacheModuleColdFusion.dll
>Fix:
No suggestions, but please do. Cold Fusion support (And the fact that it's light
years faster then Netscape or M$ servers) under Win32 was the reason I dropped
Nerscape and IIS like the garbage they are and went with apache. I was looking
forward to the new version, but will have to remain with 1.3.3. until this is
resloved.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Jan 13 10:41:21 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
You need to contact the vendor of Cold Fusion for a module
that will work with Apache 1.3.4.  We can do nothing about
it.
