>Environment:
HP-UX 10.20, JSDK 2.1, JDK 1.1.8
>Description:
According to the TCp?IP standard, the port is an unsigned 16 bit integer,
This should not be signed.  In jserv_ajpv11.c and jserv_watchdog.c the port is 
correctly declared as an unsigned short, but not in the jserv.h header file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use any port above 32768 and under 65536.
>Fix:
Use an unsigned short, not a signed short.
