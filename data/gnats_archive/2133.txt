RedHat 5.0 Kernel 2.0.32
Netscape 4.04
MSIE 4.01
>Description:
Netscape correctly displays .htm files from ServerRoot
but shows them as text when they are retrived from UserDir.

Even tried AddType in directory section access.conf. Telnet
to port 80 show same header info (except of course for ETag
and Last-Modified) for test.htm and test.html.

Installing 1.2.6 produced same results. Dont have any old
browsers around to test further. Old user directory server
was apache 1.0.5 on SCO OS5 which did not show this problem...
