 <br>
 <br>It has been quite some time since we have released a DD Report on a profiled
 <br>stock. In the past 2 years the market has been rather tough, especially for
 <br>OTC and smallcap stocks. We have seen a huge increase in stock promotion over
 <br>the past month and it seems that the OTC market is finally making a comeback.
 <br>Volume on bulletin board once again is increasing quite nicely.

 <br>Image World Media is up to something very different and exciting. They are
 <br>running a contest and then sending the winner into space. This is gaining
 <br>media all over the world and soon enough the price of the stock will reflect
 <br>upon the amount of attention this company is getting. MAXD has just recently
 <br>begun trading, and this could be an awesome ground floor opportunity to get
 <br>in early while the price of the stock is still low.
 <br>
 <br></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>About the Contest
 <br>
 <br> Quiz contestants could go into space </B>
 <br></P><P ALIGN=LEFT>
 <br>Russian space chiefs have reportedly agreed to take the winners of a quiz
 <br>show into space. The Russian Aviation and Space Agency will carry them as
 <br>cosmonauts on board a Soyuz craft. Private company MirCorp plans to launch
 <br>the winning contestants in 2003 and even hopes to put them on board the
 <br>International Space Station. That depends on whether any objections come from
 <br>Russia's international partners in space. If the civilians are not allowed to
 <br>visit ISS they will still be sent on a trip around the Earth. MirCorp
 <br>President Jeffrey Manber told Space.com: "This means we are able to move
 <br>forward with our media partners to do an historic game show where the winner
 <br>can go to space." Manber said MirCorp is working with Singapore's Image World
 <br>Media to produce the game show.<B>
