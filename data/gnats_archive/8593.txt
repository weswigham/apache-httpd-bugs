>Description:
Not sure if this will help but I have and NO problems with any versions of apache up to 1.3.22 .

make complained there was libexpat.so.0
It was located in /usr/local/lib/libexpat.so.0 but it appears apache was looking in /usr/lib . I simply copied (or symlinked) the file and it compiled fine.

State-Changed-Why:
I would classify this as a configuration error.  You had
expat installed, but did not have your linker configured
to find it (using LD_LIBRARY_PATH or whatever).  You
shouldn't be installing libraries in places that they
can't be found.

Thanks for using Apache!
