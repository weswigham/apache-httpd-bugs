OSF1 localhost V3.2 47 alpha
>Description:
My server config files contain "DirectoryIndex index.cgi index welcome default"
If I request a "directory object" such as http://host/foo/, and
the pseudo-negotiated file (index.cgi) is inaccessible, I will be presented
with a

    Forbidden
    You don't have permission to access /index.cgi on this server.

Notice that the hidden DirectoryIndex file name is herewith
revealed..

If there is no index.cgi, but there *is* a protected index.html,
the message changes to name "/index on this server".

Clearly too much implementation-specific information is being
included in the error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to access the directory object in a multiviewed directory whose
DirectoryIndex file(s) is(are) protected.
>Fix:
None at the moment.

State-Changed-Why:

No, it is not fixed.  To reproduce the problem, create
an "index.html" file in a directory, ensure that the server
can't access it, and also make sure that the DirectoryIndex
directive includes "index.html".  Then try to access
"mumble/" for that directory.  The error *should* say
"Forbidden .. mumble/" but instead it says "Forbidden ..
mumble/index.html" -- thus exposing information not
present in the original request.
