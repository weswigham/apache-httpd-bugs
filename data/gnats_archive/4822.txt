When I try to start Apache, this message appears:

sqlinit: DBROOT must be set !!!

I can not find the term DBROOT in any configuration file, setting it as an
environment variable does not help either.
>How-To-Repeat:
email me. I give you a password, you can telnet my machine and try it.
>Fix:
tell me where to set DBROOT and what to set it to.

 Hi folks,
 
 although I couldn=B4t find the cause, I found a solution:
 
 Bevor starting the Apache server, just set an environment-variable =
 called
 DBROOT to something valid, for example (in BASH):
 
 >DBROOT=3D/temp
 >export DBROOT
 
 After this, my server would start up just fine....
 
 If you have the same Problem and try this, please be sure to drop me a =
 few
 lines to let me know if this worked for you too !

 regards,
