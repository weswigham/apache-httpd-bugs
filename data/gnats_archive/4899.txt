>Description:
I have a script that accepts data via a GET, and returns a 'status 204, No response' (neat trick, BTW, for many situations).
Before compiling in mod_perl, the log files (combined log) would properly report a code 204.
Now, it reports in the log a code 200. The script IS correctly issuing a 204, it's just logging it incorrectly.
I have 'PerlSendHeader On' and 'PerlHandler Apache::Registry' in my configuration files.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's the url for the script, you can verify a code 204 is being issued:

http://192.215.16.145/cgi-bin/getscore.cgi
>Fix:
Nope. To be honest I feel a little silly reporting this as a bug, since it is so minor.
