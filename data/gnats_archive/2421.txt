This is an HP 9000/831, with HP-UX 10.20, with most HP recommended patches
added as of late 97, and some critical patches added more recently. I've
got the HP ANSI C compiler installed.

>Description:
I'm trying to set up a configuration under the new auto-configuration
interface for Apache 1.3.0, similar to what I used for 1.2.6, and having
trouble getting it to accept what I'm putting in for the dbm library.

The script I'm running to do the configure looks like this:

- - -
#!/usr/bin/csh
# build apache 1.3 the way I like it
# /usr/local/apache exists but is not a production directory
# use this for early tests of this install approach

setenv OPTIM "+O2"
setenv CC "cc"
setenv LIBS "-lndbm"

/usr/bin/sh ./configure --verbose   \
   --enable-rule=PARANOID  \
   --enable-shared=max  \
   --runtimedir=logs \
   --logfiledir=logs \
   --sysconfdir=conf \
        --enable-module=status   \
   --enable-module=info    \
   --enable-module=rewrite \

   --enable-module=cern_meta  \
   --enable-module=expires    \
   --enable-module=headers    \
   --enable-module=setenvif

The output of that script looks like this:

 The reason seems to be that your libndbm.a cannot be found. Perhaps it is
 under a non-standard directory, so your linker is unable to find it. Try to
 use 
 
   setenv LIBS "-L/path/to/your/libs -lndbm"
 
 after finding out what /path/to/your/libs is. Perhaps something like
 /usr/local/lib or such a non-standard dir. In any case first make sure libndbm
 really exists on your system and determine where it stays. Then use these
 conrete informations in LIBS.

 I've tried your suggestion, and it does not seem to work.
 
 First, libndbm.a is in /usr/lib, not an especially obscure place.
 
 When I ran "file /usr/lib/*dbm*" and "ls -ls /usr/lib/*dbm*" this was the
 output:
 - - -

 /usr/lib/libdbm.a:	archive file -s800 relocatable library

 But I tried what you suggested anyway, running this script:

 I didn't bother to try the make again...
 
 (This is just speculation, but it it possible the test for the library is
 detecting some unrelated warning or error:
 
 One warning that comes to mind is the message:
 
 "/usr/ccs/bin/ld: (Warning) At least one PA 2.0 object file (alias.o) was
 detected. The linked output may not run on a PA 1.x system."
 
 I've seen this show up in various builds on HP/UX 10.20, though not I
 think, the last build I did of apache 1.2.6. It doesn't affect the
 usability of the results.)
 
 It seems like I need to "get under the hood" to see how the test is
 failing, in more detail.

 I think I've found the problem. It looks like a bug in the helper scripts.
 
 The value of CFLAGS that's required by the HPUX ANSI C compiler, and set-up
 for use in the higher levels of the Makefile, isn't being used to compile
 the test programs. They are ANSI C, and the cc options aren't asking for
 that.
 
 The HP ANSI complier only does ANSI if the option "-Aa" or "-Ae" is
 specified (the latter also implies -D_HPUX_SOURCE). Now the last full make
 I did, had specified "-DHPUX10 -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE" in the compiles of the
 apache modules without me doing anything special, so clearly part of the
 configure scripts know about this.
 
 But when I added a lot of vebose outout echoing to helpers/TestCompile,
 this is what I saw for the outout of the test makes:
 
 in "TestCompile func dlopen":
 - - -
 	cd ..; cc +O2  `./apaci`     helpers/testfunc.c -o helpers/testfunc
 -L/usr/lib -lndbm
 cc: "helpers/testfunc.c", line 1: error 1705: Function prototypes are an
 ANSI feature.
 *** Error exit code 1
 - - -
 in "TestCompile lib dl":
 - - -
 	cd ..; cc +O2  `./apaci`     helpers/dummy.c -o helpers/dummy -ldl
 -L/usr/lib -lndbm
 cc: "helpers/dummy.c", line 3: warning 5: "const" will become a keyword.
 cc: "helpers/dummy.c", line 3: error 1000: Unexpected symbol: "char".
 cc: "helpers/dummy.c", line 4: warning 5: "const" will become a keyword.
 cc: error 2017: Cannot recover from earlier errors, terminating.
 *** Error exit code 1
 - - -
 in "TestCompile -v func dbm_open":
 - - -
 	cd ..; cc   `./apaci`     helpers/testfunc.c -o helpers/testfunc
 -L/usr/lib -lndbm
 cc: "helpers/testfunc.c", line 1: error 1705: Function prototypes are an
 ANSI feature.
 *** Error exit code 1
 - - -
 
 in "TestCompile -v func dbm_open":
 - - -
 	cd ..; cc   `./apaci`     helpers/testfunc.c -o helpers/testfunc
 -L/usr/lib -lndbm
 cc: "helpers/testfunc.c", line 1: error 1705: Function prototypes are an
 ANSI feature.
 *** Error exit code 1
 - - -
 
 In TestCompile sanity the right flags _are_ picked up, and everything looks
 fine:
 - - -
 	cd ..; cc  -DHPUX10 -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -DSTATUS -DNO_DBM_REWRITEMAP
 -DUSE_HSREGEX `./apaci`     helpers/dummy.c -o helpers/dummy  -L/usr/lib
 -lndbm
 - - -
 
 I _think_ I've transcribed all the above correctly. I can give you all the
 parts if you want (output and modified files).
 
 But it seems pretty clear to me that the problem is due to non-ANSI
 compiles, not due to an error in the way the dbm libraries were specified.
 There may be a work-around, but this looks like a weakness of your
 configure helper scripts in the HPUX 10, HP ANSI C context.

State-Changed-When: Mon Jun 29 04:56:32 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
You're right, the CFLAGS for the compiler
are constructed _after_ the first TestCompile
is run. I tried to fix it in src/Configure but
there is no chance, I think. Because the CFLAGS are
set inside Makefile.config from which TestCompile
wants to use it. But this is done a lot of time
later in the processing. Just shuffling around
the sections in src/Configure leads to new problems
as I see other dependecies there.

So seems like I've to say: Sorry, it cannot  be
fixed in Apache 1.3.1's src/Configure mechanism
because of too much other internal dependencies.
We have to suspend this problem in the hope
that we recognize the problem for Apache 2.0 again
and can do it better....

A make with the Makefiles created works, but has -DNO_DBM_REWRITEMAP set.

Using -lndbm seemed to work on 1.2.6. Can you tell me what's wrong or
how to find why ./helpers/find-dbm-lib is failing?
