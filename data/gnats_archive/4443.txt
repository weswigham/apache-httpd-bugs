ftp://mrhat.indius.com/pub/junk.java is a simple modification to SimpleServlet that fires off a dumb little print/sleep loop.

works with green threads, never never land with native threads.
>How-To-Repeat:
install http://mrhat.indius.com/pub/junk.java as a top-level servlet

State-Changed-Why:
This is not an issue with Apache JServ, but rather an issue
with Blackdown JDK-1.1.7 and RedHat 5.2/6.0 standard libraries
(GLIBC).
Please check your GLIBC version, I know that there are major
incompatibilities with version 2.1 of the Gnu C library and
native threads.

 i of course am using glibc 2.1, but i'm also using the v3 build of
 blackdown 1.1.7, which is compiled to work with glibc 2.1. are you
 saying the native threads part of v3 is compiled to work with glibc 2.1
 but is broken in some other way?
 
 i had the same problems using Threads in servlets with the old glibc.
 
 i don't know if it's jserv or the blackdown native threads port.
 
 1) i am able to use native threads outside of jserv. i have a program
 (http://mrhat.indius.com/pub/Self.java) that mercilessly pounds on
 Threads & Sockets, that works fine so long as it doesn't run out of
 resources (uncollected Sockets, perhaps?).
 
 2) jserv appears to run fine with native threads so long as a servlet
 doesn't create a Thread. again, i need to try this on solaris to better
 point a finger.
