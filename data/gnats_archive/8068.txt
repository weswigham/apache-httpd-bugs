Linux 2.4.6
>Description:
The Content-Type returned by CGI scripts is always converted to lowercase.  This
is the same problem as encountered in PR#2394, but the fix for that still
converts everything to lowercase up to the first semicolon (;).

Although most of the time this would not matter, I am writing scripts to
interact with a proxy in a situation where I need to have case sensitive
content-type fields (I can't modify the proxy's behavior).
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a cgi script that prints out "Content-Type: Asdf\n\n" as its first
output.  Apache will convert this to "Content-Type: asdf\n\n"
>Fix:
Don't convert the content-type header value to lowercase.  If you need to
make it lowercase for comparison purposes (as the comments in the source state),
do so in a temporary buffer, or use a case-insensitive comparison.

State-Changed-When: Mon Jul 23 18:36:55 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The content type is defined as being case insensitive by the standards.  So it is perfectly legitimate for Apache to lowercase it.  I just don't think it is worthwhile to change this just to deal with the odd broken application that doesn't implement the HTTP specification; if it can't deal with this, there are likely many other things it can't deal with either...

You may be able to work around this using a nph- script, but I'm not positive if that will work or not.
