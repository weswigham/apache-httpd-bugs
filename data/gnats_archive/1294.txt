>Environment:
SunOS flosun 4.1.4 1 sun4c
gcc 2.7.2.2
>Description:
The server logs a [Crit] error for every file smaller than MMAP_THRESHOLD
 e.g. 
	[Tue Oct 21 14:01:36 1997] [crit] (2)No such file or directory: mmap_handler: mmap failed: /u3/www/docs/images/bullets/dots/yl_dot.gif

The client correctly displays the images or files, however.

Assuming this really is a bug, it must be a coding omission in http_core.c
around where the test if (mm==(caddr_t)-1) is made.  The code checks the
file size and if less than MMAP_THRESHOLD (only nonzero for SunOS) it sets
mm to (caddr_t) -1.  It then immediately checks mm to see if it's -1,
which it is, so it issues an error message.  Perhaps it should check the
file size again?

>How-To-Repeat:
It ought to occur on any SunOS platform
>Fix:
(see description) - I eliminated the messages by changing line 1686 of http_core.c
to read:
	if ((mm == (caddr_t)-1) && (r->finfo.st_size >= MMAP_THRESHOLD)) {

... but I'm not sure whether this is completely correct (what does block_alarms()
and unblock_alarms() do? :-%2

 Yup this is a bug.  The block/unblock are important ... try this patch
 instead of your patch:
