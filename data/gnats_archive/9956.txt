State-Changed-Why:

Please clarify...

 . are you certain that registry key existed prior to 2.0.32 install?

 . did the registry key contain other values that were removed?

I will investigate immediately, and have pulled the installer
.msi binary package until this bug is identified and resolved.

Thank you for your report and interest in the Apache HTTP 2.0 beta!

State-Changed-Why:

Closing this report - 2.0.32 was retracted.

Bugs in 2.0.34 [of which this should -not- be one of them]
will be tracked in the new bugzilla database.

Comment-Added:

For completeness in closing this report...

The 2.0.35 installer now uses the Program Menu 'Startup' folder to create a link to the ApacheMonitor application.  
No longer are we modifying anything in the HKLM/Software/MS
key at all.
