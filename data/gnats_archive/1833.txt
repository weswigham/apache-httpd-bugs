State-Changed-Why:
What you are seeing is the result of "Options MultiViews", if you
don't want the server to do this then remove that option...

As far as the compilation warnings go, ignore them, they're not fatal.

Help!

I've run into a problem with Apache 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 under AIX 4.2 I hope
someone can help me with.

The source compiles more or less cleanly with a few compaints, I doubt
are relevant to the problem. From http_main.c, I have 4 complaints about
function argument assignment in http_main.c: 

http_main.c", line 1807.47: 1506-280 (W) Function argument assignment
between types "unsigned long*" and "int*" is not allowed.....

and 4 similar ones arising from mod_imap.c:

"mod_imap.c", line 766.40: 1506-280 (W) Function argument assignment
between types "const double(*)[2]" and "double(*)[2]" is not allowed....

Here's a working example that illustrates my problem. The URL

http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/go/multicultural/teachers.html

delivers "teachers.html" properly. The URL 

http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/go/multicultural/teachers/

works too although there is NO "teachers" subdirectory. In this case,
as you can see, the server looses touch with the document base and
cannot locate the documents images.

We can compound the problem by extending the URL into the PATH_INFO
area. 

http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/go/multicultural/teachers/teachers/teachers.html

works because the server accepts the .../teachers/ directory spec as a
valid reference to the document "teachers.html" and treats the remainder
as PATH_INFO. But, again, it loses contact with the doc's images.

Documents served from public_html directories in our "tilde" areas are
handled okay. Only those contained under our document root directories
fail in the manner indicated. 

We do NOT see this problem with Apache 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 running on
Solaris 2.6 platforms, only under AIX (4.2).

Has anyone run into this? I would certainly appreciate some feedback!!! 

Thanks, 

Joe
