HP-UX 10.20
>Description:
I stop the server to cycle the logs nightly at midnight using apachectl.
Three times in the past two months the server has failed to start,
indicating that it is still running as indicated in the log output below:

Sat Jul  4 00:00:00 PDT 1998: Stop Server for Log Move.
/usr/local/etc/apache/sbin/apachectl stop: httpd stopped

Sat Jul  4 00:00:03 PDT 1998: Restart Server.
/usr/local/etc/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd (pid 4466) already running

In each case the server was found not to be running latter in the morning.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Until a fix is issued, I'm going to change the line

PS=`ps -p $PID 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep $PID`

to

PS=`ps -p $PID 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep "$PID.*httpd"`

as indicated in one of the messages found searching the database.

 The problem with grepping for the PID is that there could be another
 process with that PID included as a substring of its own PID.  While
 this shouldn't happen very often, it obviously does occur.  The
 suggested change of 'grep $PID' to 'grep "$PID.*httpd"' makes a lot of
 sense.  Going one step further 'grep "$PID .*httpd"' makes even more
 sense.
 
 Another suggestion is to remove the PID file when the server is
 successfully stopped.  And by successfully stoped, I mean check for the
 process exsitance and for any subprocesses after the kill has completed,
 even if it completes successfully.

 Will be upgrading to current version soon.  Will check new apachectl
 against local version changes at that time and send new message with
 findings.
