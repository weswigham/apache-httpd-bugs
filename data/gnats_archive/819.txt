State-Changed-Why:
The RefererLog directive is specific to the mod_log_referer
module, which is not compiled into the server by default.
Its functionality has been largely replaced by mod_log_config,
which is documented at <http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html>.
You need to either switch to using the CustomLog directive
or rebuild the httpd binary with mod_log_referer included
(which means changing your Configuration file).

Thank you for using Apache!
