Solaris 2.6 on a Sun machine
This is some of the output from the config process:
+ configured for Solaris 260 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
>Description:
This problem may be to do with the OS (Solaris 2.6) or perhaps the C compiler.
Config runs ok.  The "make" command produces the following error.  I am not the
unix administrator (quite new to this) but I'd appreciate some idea of where I'm
going wrong.  Ouput follows:
make[1]: Entering directory `/u01/apache/apache_1.3.6'
make[2]: Entering directory `/u01/apache/apache_1.3.6/src'

You are trying to use a gcc designed for Solaris 2.4 on
2.6.  You can't do that.

 Thanks Marc
 Unix is still pretty new to me.  I checked this out with our unix admin 
 people and discovered that the GCC was mounted from another machine.  They 
 are sorting it for me.
