>Description:
I'm using "force-response-1.0" on Apache1.3.3 (from 1.3.0).
Normal responses(200,304,...) satisfies my desire.

But, some responses (301,302,...) uses "HTTP/1.1".

in srm.conf:
        Redirect permanent /gone/ http://xxxx/

--------
GET /gone/ HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 30 Oct 1998 14:46:10 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.3 (Unix)
Location: http://xxxx/
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
...
--------

Expected response is "HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently".

Apache1.3.0 returns correct response.

 Exactly how are you using it?
 
 Exactly what directives are you using to set it?

 in httpd.conf:
 	SetEnv force-response-1.0
 in srm.conf
 	Redirect                /found  http://other.my.domain
 	Redirect Permanent      /perm   http://other.my.domain
