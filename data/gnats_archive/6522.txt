Look at the end of the httpd.conf file, you will probably find something like:

<Files ~>
AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Limit Options
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

Try

<Files ~ "^\.ht">
AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Limit Options
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>
