>Description:
Default installation of Apache 1.3.4 from Apache-1_3_4_win32.exe is sucessful: Apache runs.

Default installation of JServ1.0b1 from Apache_JServ_1.0b1.exe stops Apache from starting with error message

The procedure entry point _ap_pclosesocket@8 could not be located in the dynamic link libray ApacheCore.dll.

wrapper.bin and wrapper.classpath in jserv.properties use absolute paths with backslash as delimiter.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 15 08:30:04 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Please search the bugdb for previous reports of the same bug
before submitting a report.  This problem is due to the fact that
jserv is complied for 1.3.3, not 1.3.4.  It has to be recompiled
for 1.3.4 due to shortcomings in the way DLLs work.
