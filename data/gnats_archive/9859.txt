 Now Offering for your Sensitive Delight ... NEW & IMPROVED
 
 Temple 3 Ragga Dagga Exotic Pipe-Smoking Substance!
 
 Finally introduced after three years of research and development:  
 RATIO-ENHANCED, CORE-REFINED Personal Choice Smoking/Indulgence Redefined!!!
 
 Thanks to recent emphatic, potentiated advances in the laboratorial processes for the extraction of alkaloids and glycocides from botanicals & herbas, we are now able to offer, in more cultivated/enhanced/viripotent/amalgamated format, what had actually  already been the most significant, lawful, personal choice smoking substance available on the planet!!!   Temple 3 Ragga Dagga is the sweet evolution of all of that….SWEET, EXOTIC, PRODIGIOUS VEGETATION!!!  
 
 * EASILY IGNITED & STOKED
 
 * SMOKES SWEETLY! 
 
 * ABSOLUTELY LEGAL / NON-INVASIVE / NO DOWNSIDE
 
 * SOPHISTICATED…. UPLIFTING…. POISED….
 
 * LINGERS FOR A GOOD, GOODLY WHILE!
 
 * JUST A LITTLE SNIPPET / PINCH GOES A LONG, LONG WAY….JUST 4 OR 5 DRAWS OF YOUR PIPE (A traditional hand herb-pipe is included with each package of Ragga Dagga.)
 
 Temple 3 Ragga Dagga is an exclusive, botanical/herba, proprietary; Nepalesian, ultra-sensitive/responsive, exotic, pipe-smoking/stoking substance/substantiality/delight.  ‘Tis delightfulness, indeed….  T3RD is absolutely/undoubtedly the most prestigious , permitted offering of its sort on the planet!!!
 
 SIMPLY MARVELOUS….
 
 An exclusive, proprietary amalgamation, comprised of extreme high-ratio concentrated extracts which are derived from various common and uncommon sensitive/responsive herbas; Ragga Dagga extractions are master-crafted into solid jiggets/bars which are str ucturally reminiscent of what one might find in the happiness coffee and tea houses of Nepal and in many ways possess a more sophisticated, more focused ambiance.  Some of our clients have sub-entitled Temple 3 Ragga Dagga as; Moody-Foody…. DreamMatter….  Big Easy…. Sweet Sensation…. Attitude Gratitude…. Sexeesh…. Groovy…. so on and so forth…. We hear new nicknames more and more frequently that speak the accolades of Ragga Dagga…. Just because, we suppose….that T3 Ragga Dagga is the voice of personal cho ice smoking product.
 
 PLEASE NOTE: Although no botanical factor in Temple 3 is illegal or controlled by regulatory agencies and no tobacco or illegal matter is included therein and thereby we are not age-governed….it is still our mandatory ethical policy that T3RD may not be  offered or sold to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time….
 
 Here is what our customers are saying about the Ragga Dagga phenomenon:
 
 Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  I t tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

 I’m a man of my 40’s and I really know my stuff.  I don’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple  3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes  exactly like the Lebanese and blond stuff I used to smoke in the 70’s.  I am very satisfied with this product.  I like it a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

 Extreme Martial Arts Botanical Remedies
 
 Eastern culture has long had a treatment for bone, muscle, tendon, ligament, sinew and joint distress, traumas, afflictions and constrictions.  We are pleased to offer 
 
   Equivalence Tablets  &  Dragon Wing Remedy Spray
     (Hei Ping Shun)           (Hei Long Chibang)
 
 PLEASE NOTE:
 
 While it is true that all physiological traumas and injuries are unique and that no product can arbitrarily eliminate all of the pain and discomfort in all people all of the time, the combination of Equivalence Tablets (Hei Ping Shun) and Dragon Wing Rem edy (Hei Long Chibang) remedial botanicals does guarantee to at the least:
 
 1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
 (In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)
 
 2.  Significantly increase mobility and strength ratio.
 (Please remember also the significance of proper diet, excercise, rest and prayer.)
 
 Equivalence Tablets & Dragon Wing Spray Remedials are comprised of entirely natural botanical factors.
  
 While Equivalence Tablets (Hei Ping Shun) and Dragon Wing Remedy Spray (Hei Long Chibang) are extremely effective individually, they are utilized to maximum advantage when used in conjunction with one another.
