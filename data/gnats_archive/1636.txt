>Environment:
Linux 2.0.33 #3 Tue Jan 6 22:18:01 CST 1998 i586 unknown
gcc 2.7.2.3
using glibc
>Description:
When I use src/Configure to configure,
there is a warning:
ld: warning: libc.so.6, needed by /usr/local/lib/libcrypt.so, may conflict with libc.so.5

/*-- I have libc.so.6 in /usr/local/lib , what's the problem? --*/

During make, the error happens to/usr/local/include/netinet/tcp.h
-------------------------------------------------------
In file included from http_main.c:104:
/usr/local/include/netinet/tcp.h:92: parse error before `urg'
/usr/local/include/netinet/tcp.h:92: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
/usr/local/include/netinet/tcp.h:109: parse error before `}'
make[1]: *** [http_main.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/apache_1.3b3/src/main'
make: *** [subdirs] Error 1
-----------------------------------------------------

then I use the tcp.h from www.freebsd.org  and it compiles, but there is still a
warning:
 gcc  -DLINUX=2     -o httpd buildmark.o modules.o modules/standard/libstandard.a main/libmain.a os/unix/libos.a ap/libap.a regex/libregex.a  -lm -lcrypt
ld: warning: libc.so.6, needed by /usr/local/lib/libcrypt.so, may conflict with libc.so.5

and I try to execute "src/httpd --help", it produces a core and actually whatever
method I try to invoke this new-born httpd, it produces a core.
>How-To-Repeat:
I think it is a Compiling error. The new httpd will produce the 
message "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" if I use "src/httpd -v"
My old httpd(1.2.4) works ok.

State-Changed-Why:
This is unrelated to Apache but related completely to your
compilation environment.  It appears that your
Linux system is broken.  You can't just copy
include files from other operating systems and expect
them to work!

You need to get a properly installed compiler and kernel
includes on your system; this is a Linux-specific problem
that we really aren't able to help you with...
