My server would hang (stop responding) after a while. I've noticed that
in error_log I get tons of these:

[Sun Aug 15 20:34:34 1999] [error] mod_ssl: Child could not open SSLMutex lockfile /local/httpd/logs/ssl_mutex.18669 (System error follows)
[Sun Aug 15 20:34:34 1999] [error] System: No such file or directory (errno: 2)

I think there should be a code to check for this mutex file existance instead of
looping like crazy and killing my system. I'm not sure why this file disappears.
I use latest OPen_SSL.

 The problem was in mod_ssl-2.3.9.
 It is fixed in latest mod_ssl-2.3.11.
 
 Thanks
