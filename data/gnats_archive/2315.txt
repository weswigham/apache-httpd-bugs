SunOS 5.7
>Description:
This:
    # check for pidfile
    if [ -f $PIDFILE ] ; then

Should be:
    # check for pidfile
    if [ -s $PIDFILE ] ; then

in apachectl.  A zero-length placeholder file will cause grep errors
the first time apachctl is run to start the server (not enough arguments
to grep).



>How-To-Repeat:
% > ${PIDFILE}
% apachectl start
>Fix:
See Description.
