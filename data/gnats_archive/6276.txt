Apache 1.3.12
Tomcat 3.1
>Description:
Include directives like <!--# include virtual="/servlet/..." --> does not work. It seems the request is not passed through to the jserv engine of Tomcat. No error message.
Everything is working separately :
- include directives are working with "normal" (ie non servlet) URL 
- servlet is working fine ; For example the URL
  http://localhost/servlet/HelloWorldExample
  gives the expected result

The directory configuration (httpd.conf) is  (no .htaccess file in the dir.):
DocumentRoot "d:/wwwroot/"
<Directory "d:/wwwroot">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
 and the tomcat.conf contains :
ApJServMount /servlet /root
<Location /servlet/>
  order allow,deny
  allow from all
</Location>
<Location /WEB-INF/>
  order deny,allow
  deny from all
</Location>
>How-To-Repeat:
You can use three files :
- test.shtml
<HTML>
<HEAD>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
  <!--#include virtual="/test_inc1.shtml"-->
  <!--#include virtual="/servlet/HelloWorldExample"-->
  <!--#include virtual="/test_inc2.shtml"-->
</BODY>
</HTML>
- test_inc1.shtml
  First label<br>
- test_inc1.shtml
  Second label<br>
- plus the HelloWorldExample servlet provided with Tomcat.

The output is :
  First label
  Second label

nothing about the servlet ?!
