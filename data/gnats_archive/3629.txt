>Environment:
I am running Windows NT first build no patches applied.  I am making ISAPI
code with Delphi version 3.0 with all the latest patches applied.
>Description:
The return status code checks in mod_isapi for the ISAPI dll calls look like:

 if ((*isapi_version)(pVer) != TRUE) {

When I try to run my isapi server extensions I get error 500 page back.  Apparently
Delphi (and I would assume other languages) don't always define TRUE to be !FALSE
where FALSE is 0 (this is how the Apache code defines it if FALSE is not already
defined).
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a ISAPI project with Delphi and try to run the server extensions.
>Fix:
Change the code to read:

 if ((*isapi_version)(pVer) == FALSE) {

or

 if (!(*isapi_version)(pVer)) {

isn't this a safer way to check the results of a boolean expression instead of
checking that it is equall to TRUE?
