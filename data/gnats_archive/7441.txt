 Why the stars are gasping for air . . .
 Oxygen is being hailed as the latest cure for ageing skin. Lydia Slater
 reports 
 THROW out those AHAs and invest in some air. Oxygen is taking over as the
 latest word in beauty. Stars gasping for air include Uma Thurman, famous
 for her dewy skin, and a fan of the "double oxygen facial". 
 The idea behind the therapy is simple. Ageing skin, the devotees claim, is
 a result of the reduction of oxygen supply to the facial tissues.
 Thickened capillaries mean less blood supply to the skin, which starves
 the cells of oxygen and causes their metabolism to slow down. If the sun
 has damaged your skin, or you smoke, the capillaries thicken more. With
 oxygen therapy, the theory goes, you can put that missing oxygen directly
 back into the skin. 
 There are two options: the single oxygen facial (around $70), or the
 double (around $120). Both begin much the same way as any other facial -
 cleansing, exfoliating, toning and moisturising. Where they differ is in
 the lotions and potions that are massaged through your epidermis; these
 creams contain delicately suspended "pure oxygen molecules". 
 Remède, the hot favourite at New York's Bliss Spa, the salon frequented by
 Calvin Klein, Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington, is said to release
 oxygen every 40 minutes over 12 hours. 
 The single oxygen facial ends here. The double will keep you on the couch
 for another 15 minutes, while your therapist hoses down your face with a
 nozzle connected to a tank containing 100 per cent oxygen. According to
 American Vogue: "It is a bit like choosing the wax option at the end of
 the car wash. And it has remarkably similar results - your skin glows." 
 Some dermatologists deride these treatments, claiming that you can't
 improve the underlying skin by applying oxygen to the layers above. But
 the enthusiasts claim their skin
 
 You can only buy oxygen on-line from www. pure-oxygen. co.uk for £11.99
 for an eight-litre canister or £7.99 for a two-litre canister.
