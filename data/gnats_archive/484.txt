>Description:
I currently use apache 1.2b8.  Sometimes, when people browse my homepage, they
get a blank screen saying "segmentation fault".  I checked the access_log and
found out the error 304 in that log file (but not in the error log).  I tried 
to use apache 1.2b7 and I still got that error.  The error code 304 is not 
always generated.  The only one way that I can do when I get this error is just
reload the page several times.  Could you please tell me if it is because of 
my misconfiguration or not.  Thanks.

 Hi Dean,
 
 Thanks for responding my email.  I have tried apache 1.2 release
 and notice that there still have the error code 304.  I checked
 the error_log, and saw this message:
 
 [Sun Jun 29 15:47:53 1997] send body lost connection to: pool-35.tlsa.ipa.net: 
 Broken pipe
 
 There was no core file generated but the viewer will see a blank
 screen with the "Segmentation fault" appears.  If he reloads the
 page, everything turns back to normal.  I don't know if this message
 help you to find the problem or not but thank you for your time.
 
 Truong

 Well a 304 error indicates the page hasn't been modified.  Apache itself
 wouldn't ever print "Segmentation fault" on a page.  Are you running a CGI
 to generate that page?  Perhaps the people accessing it with problems are
 coming through a proxy?
 
 The send body lost connection is a normal event, users will sometimes hit
 stop before the page is loaded.
 
 Dean
