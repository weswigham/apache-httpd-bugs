>Description:
suppose u have a form with method POST and multiple text fields. also, the data of a text-field in this form exceeds 7K( approx ).
The form is submitted to a servlet. 
If u try to read the other fields in the form using request.getparameter, null is returned, even if the field has a hardcoded value in the HTML page.

This is a problem with Apache 1.3.6 jserv 1.1 on Linux. On NT apache 1.3.9 jserv 1.1 it works ok.

problem 6170 seems similar, but there is no reply to it.
>How-To-Repeat:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>
Images Byte by Byte
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1> TAKE PICTURE </H1>
<FORM Name="ACMForm" METHOD=POST ACTION="http://manoj:8000/QG/ImageTest">
<INPUT NAME="A1" VALUE="sdfsdfsdfsdfdsfdf" >
<TEXTAREA name="IMGDATA" >Text data exceeding 7K </TEXTAREA>
OR
<INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME="IMGDATA1" VALUE="TExt data exceeding 7K">

<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT NAME="SUBMIT" VALUE="SUBMIT">
</FORM>
</BODY>
</HTML>

when the form is submitted to a servlet on jserv 1.1 linux,
request.getParameter("A1") in the servlet returns null
>Fix:
Works on NT apache 1.3.9 jserv 1.1 so a comparison could provide the answer.

Subject: general/6395: problems post request data size
Date: Sat, 19 Aug 2000 05:08:01 GMT

 have found a workaround for the problem, tho not why it occurs.
 The problem seems to be with the request.getParameter() method.
 But the post data itself is accessible correctly by either 
 req.getInputStream or getReader. Content length is correct. so we
 have to read it character by character and parse the fields ourselves.
 we also have to decode the characters other than alphanemeric ones, which 
 are in the form %HH HH being the hex code. The httpUtils.parseQueryData() 
 can be used for this decoding and extracting
 the fields, provided that u have saved the post data in a string to be 
 passed as a parameter.
 Note that if there are any calls to getParameter before accessing the input 
 stream, then the stream will not point at the start, but some intermediate 
 location.
