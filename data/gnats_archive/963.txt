>Description:
The data under the section 'Current Configuration' does not show up on servers whose config files reside across NFS.
Restarting the server either completely or via a HUP or USR1 signal fixes the
problem for the short term. After a while the data 'disappears' again. Also
cd'ing to the configuration directory where the config files reside fixes
the problem. Seems that the NFS information becomes stale? Restarting the
NFS processes on both client and server had no effect. Servers that read
the config files from a local hard disk have not displayed this problem.

The error message from error_log is as follows:
[Mon Aug  4 17:23:32 1997] mod_info: couldn't open config file /var/www/conf/srm.conf
[Mon Aug  4 17:23:32 1997] mod_info: couldn't open config file /var/www/conf/access.conf

..where /var/www/conf points to a configuration directory on another server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Installing Apache on a BSD/OS 2.1 system that reads the config files
from another server across NFS, should repeat the problem. The files
are readable at first, but after time (approx 1 hour) the above error
occurs.

Are the config files readable by the user the child

This doesn't really sound like an Apache problem, but
rather some odd NFS thing.

 The config files are world readable. They are initially shown by
 mod_info (ie, after a server restart or HUP/USR1, but after a while
 mod_info says that it couldn't open the files and reports it in
 the error log files, and nothing shows up under the 'Current
 Configuration' section on the info page.

 Perhaps, but then why are the files readable for a short while?
 Like I noted in the original report, if I log into the server that
 Apache is running on, and then 'cd' into the directory that
 holds the config files (over NFS) and then reload the info page
 the 'Current Configuration' data appears on the info page.
 
 If it is a deeply embedded NFS problem, then wouldn't the actual
 web pages not be delivered as well, as they too are loaded over NFS?
 It seems to be only mod_info that has this problem.

 Boyd
