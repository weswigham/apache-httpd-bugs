>Description:

ISO code for estonian language is et, not ee, but in http.conf is:
# Danish (da) - Dutch (nl) - English (en) - Estonian (ee)
#
AddLanguage et .ee

as this will affect browsers as well (all users have to reconfigure
from et to ee), I think, current behaviour is wrong and should be changed.
>How-To-Repeat:
sure:)
>Fix:
change line
AddLanguage et .ee

and fix LanguagePriority as well

 of course this bug will not affect browsers, but existing installations
 :) (it's probably too late, to think correctly:)

State-Changed-Why:
Not really a bug; the actual code sent out is 'et' i.e
correct. It is just that the file name looks funny.

I have brought htis in sycn for 2.0.
