The error log says exactly what the problem is:

[Sun Nov 08 09:49:27 1998] [error] Invalid path in os_stat: "/Program Files/Apa
che/proxy/.time", should have a drive letter or be a UNC path

You need a drive letter on that path.  ie. "c:/Program Files/Apache/proxy",
and on all your other paths.  This should have been done by the install
program.
