With apache 1.3.11 and later underscore in ServerName doesn't work.

With apache 1.3.9 and lower it works fine.

I get the error Message:
  Bad Request
  Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand
  Client sent malformed Host header

Any suggestion?

Same problem was reported on 8. February (Nr. 5722), but no response

Apache Configuration with underscore in servername

State-Changed-Why:

Underscores are not valid in HTTP hostnames.  Earlier
versions of Apache were lax about enforcing this.
