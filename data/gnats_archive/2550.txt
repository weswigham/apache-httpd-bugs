AuthDBUserFile works fine.
AuthDBMUserFile failed. Error log ...
 [Sun Jul  5 22:24:45 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: could not open dbm auth file: /etc/dbmpasswd
 [Sun Jul  5 22:24:45 1998] [error] DBM user guest not found: /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs/perldoc

Tried compiling without mod_auth_db.o, still got same problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a user by "dbmmanage /etc/dbmpasswd adduser guest"
Edit .htaccess file to use "AuthDBUserFile /etc/dbmpasswd" ... works.
Edit .htaccess file to use "AuthDBMUserFile /etc/dbmpasswd" ... failed.
Recompiled without mod_auth_db.o, still got same problem.

No.

State-Changed-Why:
I don't understand what the bug is here. As you've seen,
dbmmanage creates a DB file by default. So, mod_auth_db
works. mod_auth_dbm fails because it is looking for a DBM.

If your bug is that dbmmanage is not creating DBMs, then you
can change this. 

Look at the line:

BEGIN { @AnyDBM_File::ISA = qw(DB_File NDBM_File GDBM_File) }

Reorder the qw() structure so that the type of file you want
comes first. If you want NDBM files by default, use:

BEGIN { @AnyDBM_File::ISA = qw(NDBM_File DB_File GDBM_File) }

for example.

Please reply telling us what bug you are reporting
specifically, or if the above change fixes your problem.
