>Description:
Apache is not reading .htaccess files in the destination directories
of an alias.

eg.
conf file includes:
ALIAS /CNDAT/ /project/noise/cndat/

Subdirectories of /project/noise/cndat/ have .htaccess files, but Apache
does not parse them.

If I make a symbolic link from my document root directory to /project/noise/cndat/
and name it /CNDAT/ then Apache parses the .htaccess files.

I can't find anything in the documentation which says that ALIASes are
supposed to turn off the .htaccess parsing in the subdirectories.

 There's a bit in the documentation for Options FollowSymLinks which
 describes that apache, when following symlinks, does *not* rewrite the
 directory/filename. 
 
 When following Aliases it does rewrite the directory/filename.  So you
 have to ensure that you have a <Directory /abc> section that covers the
 *destination* of the Alias describing what you want it to do. 
 
 i.e. if /abc/def is a symlink to /do/wah and you reference /abc/def/ditty,
 then apache will use only <Directory> sections covering /abc/def/ditty for
 this reference. 
 
 But if /abc/def is an alias to /do/wah, and you reference /abc/def/ditty
 then apache will consider <Directory> matching /abc/def/ditty and
 /do/wah/ditty
 
 symlink != alias
 
 Does that make sense?

 OH! Yes, this makes sense. May I suggest that perhaps it
 should be mentioned in the documentation of the alias
 module?
 
 Thanks for your help,

 Er, yer right.  It only considers the destination of the Alias.  aliases
 are dealt with before directory_walk, where directory is dealt with.
