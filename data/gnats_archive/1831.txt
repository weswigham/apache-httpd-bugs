>Description:
The ProxyDomain directive uses aplog_error() to log possible redirections.
Unfortunately, an URI can (and often will) contain '%'-encoded metachars
like '~'->'%7E' which are then mistaken as printf() percent tokens.

Oh, and the table_get("Referer") semantics apparently changed: it now returns
"-" instead of NULL which then leads to a log message "... from -" (the
intention was to suppress the "from" part if the referer was undefined).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
For the first part, the fix is easy: add an extra >>"%s",<< in front of the
pstrdup() call in the aplog_error() call.
The second problem is easy to fix as well:
check for (ref!= NULL && !strcmp(ref, "-"))

The report was not based on 1.3b5, but on part of an older
apache version which had slipped in my source base.
