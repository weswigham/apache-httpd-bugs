>Description:
Similar to PR#1558, It doesn't work when alias to a mapped drive but the error is "403 Forbidden You don't have permission to access /t/Technician.doc on this server." despite there's a .htaccess in z: mapped drive.

Error.log shows this:
[Tue Jul 14 18:55:00 1998] [crit] (13)Permission denied: z:/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

>How-To-Repeat:
put this alias in srm.conf and create a mapped drive called Z: to some other shares on other windows box

Alias /mapdrive/ "z:/"
