Linux ljm.qqjane.net 2.2.18 #4 SMP Sun Dec 24 21:22:14 CST 2000 i686 unknown
GCC 2.95.1 / GLIBC 2.2.1
>Description:
Since GLIBC 2.2.1, from which the whole DB tree is removed, mod_rewrite
need external DB setting. src/modules/standard/mod_rewrite.h and correspond
LIBS should be modified for it. New configuration script in detecting
BerkeleyDB (v2 or v3) should be added to accomplish this modification.
Thanks in advance for concern.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just compile Apache with --enable-module=mod_rewrite with GLIBC 2.2.1
and remove any old include files (i.e. those from GLIBC 2.1)
