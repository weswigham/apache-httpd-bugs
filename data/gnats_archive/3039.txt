SunOS 5.6 Generic_105181-05 sum4m sparc SUNW, SPARCstation-5
gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I enabled mod_mmap_static in my Configuration file (everything stayed basically
the same, although I also added Apache-SSL and mod_perl).

I used a very simple MMapFile directive, i.e.
MMapFile /var/cyberspace.mit.edu/htdocs/index.html

This should be the correct path... the DocumentRoot is
/var/cyberspace.mit.edu/htdocs
and later configuration directives are located within
<Directory /var/cyberspace.mit.edu/htdocs>...</Directory>

I load the page (using lynx, but browser doesn't seem to make a difference,
nor should it). Then, I change it with an in-place edit (just vi or emacs)
... adding "ABCABC" to the last line, for example.

Then, I reload the file. The new changed text "ABCABC" appears.

According to the docs for mmap_static, this shouldn't happen -- the changes
should appear unless I unlink the file (via mv or rm).

BTW, the reason I'm trying to produce this "dumb" result is to verify that
mmap_static is working. If, for some reason, mmap_static somehow does a stat
and checks for an update disk, then I am the "dumb" one.
>How-To-Repeat:
It's a little tricky, since I'd have to edit the file. If you want to arrange
a time to look at the file, and then 5 minutes later load it again, I can set
that up... I'm logged on 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST, and often later.
>Fix:
Not really, but then again it's not that serious a problem. In fact, since
it looks like "mmap_static" is not a "category" choice above, maybe it's not
even supported. If so, sorry for the inconvenience.

 From www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mmap_static: 
 
 ... To reiterate that point: if the files are modified in place without
 restarting the server you may end up serving requests that are completely
 bogus.  ... 
 
 Which is exactly the behaviour you're describing.

 Does bogus include actually recognizing/displaying the modified files
 without restarting the server (which is the behavior I saw)?
 
 -- if no --
 
  I gathered from the documentation that any changes would *not* be
  displayed, and thus I tried to use that to test whether mmap_static was
  running (changes would not be displayed) or not (changes would be
  displayed, as normal).
 
  I reloaded the page with about 5 different versions, and did each one about
  20 times from different hosts (in an attempt to distribute across the
  server processes) and got completely predictable/normal behavior, as in the
  changes are duly replicated in my browser, *without* a server restart.
 
 -- end if --
 
 Again, if "bogus" means actually doing the normal thing (showing changes
 w/o restart), my sincere apologies. Is there a better way to tell if
 mmap_static is working properly?
 
 Thanks.

 P.S. Apache is an increasingly perfect product. I teach a Web design and
 development class to MIT undergraduates and I take every chance to say good
 things about Apache (and open development). Recently, I had the need to
 write a module using the API, and it was wonderful, especially compared to
 NSAPI.

 bogus means anything, it means anything could happen.  As in, it could
 play Merry had a Little Lamb for you :)  You happen to have gotten lucky
 and the changes did something that you think is "right".  It isn't though. 
 
 The documentation explicitly says that you have to restart the server.  It
 also explicitly says not to modify the files in place.
 
 The whole thing is experimental and regular sites don't need it at all.
