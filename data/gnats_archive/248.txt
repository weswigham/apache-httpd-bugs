>Environment:
Linux 1.2.13 (Red Hat 2.1)
>Description:
I downloaded the 1.2b7 binary and made the appropriate edits to the new 
config files to match the previous environment (the pre-1.0 Apache included
in Red Hat 2.1).  Starting httpd failed repeatedly until I commented out 
a number of directives, including UserDir, Alias, ScriptAlias and 
LanguagePriority in srm.conf, and BrowserMatch in httpd.conf.  These are 
reported as syntax errors - "invalid command".  The server appears to work 
normally without these directives, except that Fancy Indexing returns the
generic "torn icon" for everything instead of the appropriate file type icon.
>How-To-Repeat:
This is currently an internal web server with no access from the Internet.

State-Changed-Why:

The "httpd -h" command does give the module name. I am not
sure what the problem might be, but it is likely due to a
bad binary.  We strongly recommend downloading the sources
and compiling locally.

FYI, there is not supposed to be an Apache 1.2b7 binary
(the file you downloaded has been deleted from the
www.apache.org site). We are sorry for the inconvenience.
