[Tue Nov 17 18:07:13 1998] [crit] (124)Address family not supported by protocol family: make_sock: could not bind to port 1000

I have tried different kind of ports, but the problem persists.
I checked the code and find that the "bind" call is failing in the
"make_sock" function.

State-Changed-Why:
I am not sure what "MP-RAS" is but on the Unices you must
have root priv. to bind to a port < 1024...So Change
your Port command to one like 8889 and try to see if you can
start Apache.  If you do have root priv. then make sure
no other service is running on port 1000.

Thanks for using Apache
