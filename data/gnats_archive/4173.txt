State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 30 20:32:49 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Please use a current version of Apache.  Even if you make
it get around the getpass() issue, it still won't work on
1.3.4.  The current version of Apache includes a compiled
htpasswd.exe & source that will compile.
