>Description:
My users seem to be incapable of correctly using the "no proxy" browser 
setting.  I need an internal proxy that forwards most requests out the firewall,
and sends direct requests to internal servers.  My internet firewall proxy
can't forward to internal servers.  This works for most of the internal
servers:

ProxyRemote http://www.internal-dept1.mydomain http://www.internal-dept1.mydomain
ProxyRemote http://www.internal-dept2.mydomain http://www.internal-dept2.mydomain
ProxyRemote * http://myfirewall.mydomain

The internal servers receive "GET http://www.internal-dept1.mydomain/path",
recognize their own hostname, and strip it off.  Unfortunately, I have 
an application (Concord Nethealth) with an integral web server that's 
too stupid to do that.  I need the proxy to send to it in direct mode.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Change the ProxyRemote parser to accept "direct" as the remote proxy.

ProxyRemote http://www.internal-dept1.mydomain direct
ProxyRemote http://www.internal-dept2.mydomain direct
ProxyRemote * http://myfirewall.mydomain

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for the suggestion; we will consider it for
a version of Apache after 1.2 (which is in feature
freeze right now).

State-Changed-When: Wed Dec 10 16:13:03 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:

Apache 1.3a1 (and higher versions) contain a new
directive called "NoProxy" which can be used
to list hosts/domains that should be queried
directly without going through a remote proxy.
