>Description:
  I have run into a problem with some Apache processes hanging on Linux.
The webserver is fine for a little while, but then at least one child
(and likely many) stops accepting connections properly.  We have a
watchdog cron job that runs every 3 minutes to check the webserver.
About 14% of the time, the watchdog is unable to connect to the
webserver (times out after 5 minutes).  But, during this same time,
clients are able to connect to other child processes and retrieve web
pages.  The MaxClients has not been reached.

  The only changes to the code we have made is to raise the
HARD_SERVER_LIMIT to 1024, as it comes as 255 by default for Linux.
This seems to work fine for several of our servers.  But for two of our
servers, we see this problem.
