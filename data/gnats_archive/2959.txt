>Description:
I am using a version of apache, that is part of the FreeBSD 2.2.7 Ports collection. The main server works fine, but if I add a virtual host
I get 403 (Forbidden - You don't have permission to access / on this server)
on any web page my server server.
ie: Using the default config files, it works fine. If I add a virtual host, I get Forbidden on any page.
>How-To-Repeat:
All my config files, are at:   http://www.rug-rats.org
the default files, which work (without virtualhosts) are there too, with .default appended to the file name.

In any case, this problem is almost certainly a combination
of wrong permissions with failure to use the NameVirtualHost
directive in a proper fashoion.

 You mean all accesses are denied, including those not to the vhost, or are
 just those to the vhost denied?
 
 What does the error log say?
 
 Are you trying to do name-based (ie. one IP for all vhosts) virtual
 hosting?  If so, please read the docs because you are missing a
 NameVirtualHost directive.
 
 Also check that the permissions on
 /home/epitaph/public_html/www.gravestone.org/data and all directories
 leading up to that are world readable.
 
 Also note that it is a very bad idea to put log files in users' home
 directories, as it creates a major security hole described in the docs.
