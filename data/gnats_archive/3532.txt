>Description:
The following rewrite rule causes apache to run at 100% cpu and consume tons of ram until I kill it.  It creates basically an infinite rewrite rule.  This behaved properly in 1.2.6, and now I have had to modify the rewrite rule.

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.rumple.net
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://www.rumple.net/$1

If I modify the rewrite rule as follows it works fine.

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.rumple.net
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://www.rumple.net/$1 [L,R]

The downside to this is it actually causes a redirect in my browser, where as before it was just an internal rewrite.  The real catch is I have lots of users who have this exact rewrite rule in their .htaccess files, and one by one I am having to hand patch these.
