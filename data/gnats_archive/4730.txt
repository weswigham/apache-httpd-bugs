Hello

In the file httpd.conf file I have the following lines:

:
Options +Includes
:
AddHandler server-parsed .htm
:
I would like, that all files parsed with mod_includes. Here you will see an example:

---------------
<!--#include virtual="/head.htm" -->

<b>WILLKOMMEN<br>
:
<b>AKTUELLES</b><br>
:
:

<img src="images/foot.jpg" align="right">

<!--#include virtual="inhalt.inc" -->
<!--#include virtual="/foot.htm" -->
---------------

On the browser i will see, that all ssi commands are unparsed!
The "httpd -l" command says, that the mod_includes are built in (i have it compiled so!).

Did you have an idea, what the error is?
Thank you, verry much

You can show my httpd.conf file on
