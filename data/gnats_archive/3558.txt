>Description:
The error log has entries such as:
[error] (17)File exists: proxy: error linking cache file /here/proxy/tmpaxxxxx to /here/proxy/0/_/xxxxxxxx

Noticed mention to this problem for version 1.2x and it was recommended to upgrade to 1.3bx: I have done this.
The problem is still here?
Is this still a 'known' problem in 1.3.3 with tmp files not being unlink'd
