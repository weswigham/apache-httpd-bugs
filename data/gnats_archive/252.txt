>Description:
Please load the two URLs attached first.
They're indentical pages.

After I pressed the [link to C], the right frame is updated and
changes from 'B' to 'C'.  

*** But when I press the RELOAD button in my browsers, <maggi>'s
    page (using Apache web server) changes to original frames,
    i.e. left frame = A  and  right frame = B

    But it's ok for <erah>'s page (using Netscape Server) which
    load the page with last updated frames, 
    i.e. left frame = A  and  right frame = C

This is quite a basic but serious problem. 

I've got a commercial web site running on Apache's server which 
is going to have frames added.  But I don't want my users to be 
forced to go back to the first page and click everything once 
again every time they press the RELOAD button.

I'd be most grateful if you could give me a quick response on
this problem so that I can determine about the future of my
web site.

Thank you very much!!  

Best regards,
Ferdinand Mo

thanks again

State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 25 22:35:52 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Errmm... both servers are running Apache.  One is setting a
Last-modified, one isn't.  The one with no last modified is
likely parsing all the documents as SSI with mod_include.  This
causes Netscape not to cache them.  It is a Netscape issue, not
an Apache issue.
