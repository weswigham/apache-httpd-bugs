>How-To-Repeat:
Well, the easiest way to cause the problem is to have a bunch of servlets from
different servlet zones all connect to the database, throw out everyone, connect,
throw out, etc. until the server dies.  I dunno if it's using up all the file
descriptors or what...
>Fix:
No.  I tried increasing the ulimit, but I don't know if it worked.  I RTFMed,
and nothing even mentions this problem.
