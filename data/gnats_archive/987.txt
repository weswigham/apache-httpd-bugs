One httpd occasionally goes into a tight loop, logging 
	select: (listen) bad address
Server is under considerable load (maxed out on 120 servers).

strace output of the offending httpd:
oldselect(25, [15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24], NULL, NULL, NULL) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
time(NULL)                              = 871049640

 Any chance you want to try out the 2.0.31-pre6 kernel?  Linus is going to
 roll 2.0.31 final this weekend so you could just wait until next week. 
 
 Can you reproduce this problem at will?  If so it would be nice to find
 out if it's something that's apache's fault or if it's something that's
 the kernel's fault.  I really suspect the kernel.

 Not for a week or more: I already upgraded to 2.0.30 in the light of PR 
 588!
 
 BTW - something to note with 2.0.30 under Debian is they chose (curse 
 'em) to make their default kernel with SYN and RST cookies on: great way 
 to make a webserver thrash as it swaps klogd/syslogd in and out to log 
 them.
 
 >Can you reproduce this problem at will?  
 
 If 'fire up Apache, wait a while' counts as 'at will', yes (*wry grin*). 
 It seems to be load related, but that could just be a case of 'more 
 connections, more likelihood of it happening'.

 So do I, to be honest:
