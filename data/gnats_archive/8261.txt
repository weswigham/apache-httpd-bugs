egcs-1.1.2 on both

Apache 1.3.20 + PHP4.0.6 + mod_ssl-2.8.4 + mod_log_spread.
>Description:
We have a high-traffic site that is distributed through ipvs to several servers. On two of these servers -- the only ones that run 1.3.20 -- we have the following problem.

A number of httpds - a few at the beginning, but many after a while - are left in th e K state, viewable in /server-status. A strace on them reveals they are blocked on fd 4, which an inspection to /proc reports is the remote socket. I have seen processes hanging for over 50,000s, and apache will not kill them. I've tried inspecting the socket, and many times the remote host is actually offline. If I kill -ALRM the pid of the process, it refuses to die; using -USR2, however, it dies off immediately.

I can't really see where this bug is. I've read through bug reports at http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/1190 and http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/3906 but they don't really provide definitive information at all. Both these bugs are for other architectures, but I suppose it could be a kernel bug, or a problem with one of the dependencies masking SIGALRM and not unmasking afterwards.

The /server-status map looks like this at times:

KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK_KKK_KKK_KWKKKKKKKKKKWRKWKKKKKK__KKWKKKKKKK
KKKKKKKK_KKKKKKKKK_K_KKKKKKKWKK_.KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK_KK
KKKKKKKR_KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK_KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK__KKKKKKKKKKKK
KKRKKKKKKK_KKKRK_KKKKK_KKKKK_KKKKKKKKK__K__W....................

And, listing the processes out, I find things like 50,000 SS times or more. My timeout is 300s and my keepalivetimeout, 15s.

I've asked on the newsgroup, but no answer was given, so I'm trying here.
>How-To-Repeat:
It is very difficult to generate a simple repeat pattern. But if the site is left up for enough time (usually a couple of hours) it will slow to a crawl because of the amount of httpds blocked doing nothing.
>Fix:
I've in the meantime tried recompiling everything, and since that didn't work, now, after a week, I've patched with the following change. However, I know this is _not_ a fix and I would like to see this solved. Thanks.
