>Description:
The "check" command in my version of dbmmanage seems to assume that the
values in the DBM file are merely the crypted passwords.  This can be wrong;
a value may look like
    <crypted_password>[:<group_list>[:<any_other_stuff>]]
I tried with a user file which contains all of the three possible fields,
and the check command always replies with "password mismatch".
>How-To-Repeat:
Try dbmmanage "check" on any DBM file which combines user and group information.
>Fix:
In dbmc::check(), use split() to extract the crypted password from $DB{$key}.
