>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional SP2, Visual Studio 7 build 9254 (aka VS.NET Beta 2)
>Description:
Visual Studio 7 features an enhanced "Configuration Manager" which allows the simple exlusion of projects from the build.  When electing not to build the projects for the optional modules (the "mod_" projects), InstallBin generates a Fatal Error when the "copy" command for an omitted module returns an error code of 0x01 ("The system cannot find the file specified.").
>How-To-Repeat:
Any system running any build of VS.NET Beta 2 should be able to see this error by using the Configuraton Manager (on the Build menu) to disable a "mod_" project by unchecking the box in the Build column.
>Fix:
Use the "dash" command at the beginning of the appropriate lines in Makefile.win (replace "copy" with "-copy" at the beginning of the lines that copy the optional modules to their destinations)
