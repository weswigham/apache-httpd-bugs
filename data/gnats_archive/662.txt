SunOS gimli 5.5 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5
>Description:
I have installed  apache V1.2b11 on two Sun Sparc5 and want to
use Server Side Includes.
I set the option XBitHack Full in the access.conf File to turn on
text/html server-parsing by activating the owner x bit.

The link http://gonzo.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/itineu.html works right,
that means that the SSI includes works correctly.

The link http://gimli.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/itineu.html doesn't work
right, that means that the SSI includes are not interpreted, if
you look the source of this page in your web-browser, you can see the
tags for the includes.

Both apache deamons have the same configuration and are the same
binary.

State-Changed-Why:
I suspect a difference between the access.conf files or perhaps
the existance of a .htaccess which is readable on one machine
but not the other.  The error_log might provide a hint...
