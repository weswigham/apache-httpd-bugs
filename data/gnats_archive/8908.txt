>Description:
I have Apache 1.3.22 linked to Tomcat3.3 using mod_jk 
I have been doing a load test on tomcat which essentially 
puts apache and mod_jk also under load test. However I saw that
after a couple of hours Apache stops responding. Here is an extract
from error.log

[Fri Nov 30 01:23:12 2001] [error] [client 65.84.246.20] File does not exist: c:/software/apache/htdocs/scripts/..%5c/winnt/system32/cmd.exe

Here is the corresponding access.log for same time frame

If you closely watch it, you can see that Apache didnt respond for 4 minutes. 
In fact this crash I only figured after I saw at these log files. I thought
it never recovers once it crashes. However yesterday, after crash, I have
seen two processes with name "apache.exe" in my process list. Not sure
how did two processes got invoked. Actually even right now there are two 
processes with same name. I think Apache might be invoking another process
as a failover once it crashes (sorry dont know the architecture of Apache
at all).

My load test involves 200 users hitting the pages with random delays.
My system processor load is about 15% on average. Memory utilization is 
low at 232MB (I have 256MB physical RAM + virtual RAM)
>How-To-Repeat:
Link Apache with Tomcat3.3 using mod_jk, put the system under load.
Hopefully it will repeat itself.

no
