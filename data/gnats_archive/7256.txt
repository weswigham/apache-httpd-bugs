Linux starlaser 2.2.16 #21 Wed Dec 27 19:55:51 CET 2000 i686 unknown

it's slackware 7.0 

Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-slackware-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
>Description:
i issued: "htpasswd -b .htpasswd kiss hello" and traced program execution with gdb

Breakpoint 1, 0x8049b36 in ap_cpystrn ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x8049b36 in ap_cpystrn ()
#1  0x8048f0a in mkrecord ()
#2  0x80497b3 in main ()
#3  0x40056aa7 in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x8049b36 in ap_cpystrn ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x8049b36 in ap_cpystrn ()
#1  0x8048f0a in mkrecord ()
#2  0x80497b3 in main ()
#3  0x40056aa7 in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6

(gdb) info register edx
edx            0x0      0

this is the code where the program crashes (ap_cpystrn line)

 ap_getpass("Re-type new password: ", pwv, sizeof(pwv));
        if (strcmp(pwin, pwv) != 0) {
            ap_cpystrn(record, "password verification error", (rlen - 1));
            return ERR_PWMISMATCH;
        }
>How-To-Repeat:
i just typed (from a normal user shell) : htpasswd -b .htpasswd kiss
where .htpasswd is an empty file and kiss is the username to be added
(same error using -b option)
>Fix:
use strncpy instead
