 I'm sure our installation procedure isn't broken because it works ;-) Instead
 I guess some local program the our install.sh script uses is broken on your
 platform. Try to run it manually and find out which program actually dumps
 core and contact your OS vendor when it's something like `cp', `chmod',
 `strip', etc.
