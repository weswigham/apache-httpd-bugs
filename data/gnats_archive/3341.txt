>Environment:
I'm running Win95 (Pentium II 266MHz)and used GCC for Win32 to compile the program. I don't know the version of GCC
but it is downloaded within three weeks from now. 
>Description:
This is what happens when I run GCC.

Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html. If you don't
wish to do the port yourself, please submit this output rather
than the patches. Thank you.

Pressing on with the build process, but all bets are off.
Do not be surprised if it fails. If it works, and even
if it does not, please contact the above address.

>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to compile it on a Win95 with GCC for Win32. 
>Fix:
I know that there already is a precompiled version of Apache for Win32 compiling it gives
one the advantage of choosing the components.

State-Changed-Why:
As the docs say, we only support MSVC on Win32.

You don't gain any ability to "choose" the components
by compiling yourself, since most modules are already
loadable DLLs in the binary version.
