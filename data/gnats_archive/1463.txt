State-Changed-When: Sun Nov 23 12:53:08 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid we can not help you.  This is for bugs reports
about the Apache web server; what you give is not a bug
report because it contains no information.

Comment-Added:
In addition, the syntax for refreshing the status page
is to add "?refresh=30" *not* "?30".
