>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
SunOS 5.6/SPARC, Linux 2.2.5, both with gcc
>Description:
If mod_expires is enabled and set to generate a header, it will also generate a
Cache-Control: max-age header. If this is done, it's impossible to set any
other Cache-Control: response headers via mod_headers, they will be silently
overwritten by the max-age header.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) build an apache: ./configure --enable-module=expires --enable-module=headers
2) put this into a .htaccess:
ExpiresActive ON
ExpiresDefault A15
Header append Cache-Control "public"
>Fix:
mod_expires should append the header, not overwrite it.
