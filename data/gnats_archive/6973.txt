>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Winnt 4.0
>Description:
RFC 2068 , specifies that the Range header can look like this
Range: bytes=0-,0-,0- 

But , while looking at it , I saw that Apache 1.3.14 is not compatible with
that kind of range header.
>How-To-Repeat:
GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
Range: bytes=0-,0-,0-
>Fix:
Yes, the next line should be changed:
return (*start > 0 || *end < clength - 1);

 Actually, scrub that last email. This is a newly discovered problem.
 (I could have sworn I checked that line for sanity when dealing with
 6711.)
 
 What do you think of this patch?
