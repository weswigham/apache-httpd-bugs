Windows 98, 1.3.2
>Description:
When I run this code:

<?php 
session_start();
$username = "someusername";
session_register("username");
?>

It gives me this error:

Warning: open(/tmp\sess_6ff60f58fd2f6576373db6574a273f28, O_RDWR) failed: m (2) in c:\windows\desktop\apache files\session.php on line 2

Warning: open(/tmp\sess_6ff60f58fd2f6576373db6574a273f28, O_RDWR) failed: m (2) in Unknown on line 0

Warning: Failed to write session data (files). Please verify that the current setting of session.save_path is correct (/tmp) in Unknown on line 0

>How-To-Repeat:
Can't. It works on any regular server, but when apache is on my computer, sessions don't work.
>Fix:
Allow session hanlding. I don't exactly know the technical side of it.
