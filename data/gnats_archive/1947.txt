>Environment:
Linux 2.0.30 - 6x86L-PC - Apache 1.2.4
>Description:
This is something I would like to see added...we use the 
RefererLog and RefererIgnore quite a bit to filter our logs
and I noticed that there is no case insensitive way to 
check the URL in RefererIgnore.  Any variation of upper/lower
case letters in the URL get's logged as an outside request.

If I get this implemented, can I be a contributor?  :-)
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up RefererLog and RefererIgnore directives and then
call the web URL with variations in upper/lower case letters.
Only the exact match is filtered out.
>Fix:
Perhaps a "tolower()" type of function for everything in 
front of the first file path in the URL%3

State-Changed-Why:
A fix for this has been implemented in the 1.3 code base;
we're planning a 1.3b7 release soon.  Since all our focus is
on 1.3 and this isn't a protocol error it's unlikely this
will be backported to 1.2.x, but it might.  Thanks for the
report.
