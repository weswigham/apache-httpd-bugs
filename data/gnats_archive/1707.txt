Windows 95 OSR2 PE (Russian, version 4.950B). Executable of Apache taken from Apache server (i.e. compiler not known)
>Description:
Apache 1.3b3 terminates correctly when Ctrl+Brk is pressed in console window. However, if you exit Windows without closing Apache it produces a GPF in most cases. On our server HTML-documents are parsed by a script (.exe) for all requests and after first access to any document the title of Apache window changes to the name of script. Perhaps the origin of the problem is incorrect calling of CGI-scripts?

Do you find this still happens with Apache 1.3.1 on Windows?
1.3b3 was a looong time ago.

 Sorry for misinformation in my first letter. We _always_ get GPF when 
 exiting Win95-OSR2-Rus while apache is still running. I've sent the 
 information just after version 1.3b3 was released. Currently we are 
 with apache 1.3b7. It still has the bug. Perhaps I'll try the latest 
 release in few days.

 	Hi!
 I want to give more detailed description to the problem. It seems to be 
 more the Win95 than Apache bug.
 We get invalid page fault in Winoldap at 137:bff8a6ed when all the 
 following conditions are met:
 1. We use Russian Windows 95 OSR 2. (We have tried it on no other Win95 
 neither paneuropean nor american).
 2. Apache is started from "Autostart" menu or from registry key 
 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" as 
 _DOS_ program.
 3. PIF settings for Apache DOS window are set to "No warning before 
 exit" at "Misc" tab.
 4. We exit Windows without closing Apache explicitly.
 On the other hand, if we close Apache window by clicking X button at 
 the top-right corner we get no error messages.
 
 	Ciao, OLeG
