Im running apache_1.3.19-win32-no_src-r2.msi under Windows 2000 SP1
>Description:
error.log contain this

FATAL:  erealloc():  Unable to allocate 22528 bytes

all other entries in the error.log is also timestamped, it would be good
if this one was aswell, i cant tell when this happened. i have had some crashes with apache on win32, it tries to access memory at 0x0000000 and some other unallocated areas, i suppose this is related to the entry in the logfile
