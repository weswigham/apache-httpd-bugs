>Description:
In SetEnv, if you put a colon or a dash in the environment key, when a CGI is 
run, that colon or dash will be translated into an underscore.  However, I 
don't think it is a problem with SetEnv, because I ran into the same problem 
in one of my own modules.  I thinks the problem is in the core API, but I 
couldn't figure out where that was happening.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do something like

SetEnv something:somethingelse whatever

and when you run a CGI, the environment will look like

something_somethingelse  whatever
>Fix:
No
