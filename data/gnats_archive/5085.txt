>Description:
Problems to access resources with authentification after publishing
a file onto the webserver successfully.

1. I activated the PUT method for the webserver in the http.conf file  
   and installed the cgi-Script put.cgi which handles the PUT request.

   <Files *.cgi>
     Options ExecCGI
     SetHandler cgi-script
   </Files>

 
   <Directory "d:/html/tapwww/docu">
     Script PUT /put/put.cgi
    </Directory>

   ScriptAlias /put "d:/html/tapwww/put"

2. I successfully published a file via the Netscape Composer. 
   Netscape Navigator was also running.
   
3. I tried to access a resource with authentification (defined by
   .htacces file) from the webserver, but it didn't work. The resource
   was not the published file and also located in a different directory
   than the published file.
   The following message was permanently written to the 
   access.log file of the webserver:

     148.56.16.63 - - [29/Sep/1999:15:11:56 +0200] "GET /docu/ HTTP/1.0" 401 458
   
   I had to push the stop button of the Navigator to stop it.

   To access the resource from another computer with the Navigator was successful. 
   Accessing a resource with authentication of another Apache webserver was
   successful. 

4. I killed the Navigator and Composer processes and started
   the Navigator again. Then I could access the same resource 
   with authentification successfully.  

5. This behaviour can be repeated every time.

State-Changed-Why:
I really can't see how this could be anything to do with
Apache.  Apache does not store any such state information
that could possibly make it even know that it was the same
client that had tried accessing it before, and it certainly
has no way to know if you exit and restart your web client.
I would have to suggest that this is probably a bug in your
client...

 I believe this is a know bug in netscape; see their knowledge database.
