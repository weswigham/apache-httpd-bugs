State-Changed-Why:
PHP is distributed separately from the Apache HTTP server and has its own bug tracking system.  We can do nothing about problems with PHP.

 But it isn't a problem with PHP. It's a problem with apache because when i
 install an older version of the server, all things works perfectly.
