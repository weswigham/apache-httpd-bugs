NT 1381 pl3 (not by choice)
>Description:
The PATH_INFO environment variable contents are translated to all lower case as they are passed into any CGI-BIN program.
I.E.:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/printenv/Examples/HelloWorld
produces the following when the server resides on WinNT:
PATH_INFO = /examples/helloworld
It produces:
PATH_INFO = /Examples/HelloWorld
when the server resides on Unix (OpentStep Mach 4.2, BTW).
End result;  Apache cannot be used to server WebObjects applications under NT (likely, this will affect other similar products, as well).
>How-To-Repeat:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/printenv/FOO/BaR/bAz
...view the PATH_INFO on the resulting page...
Under NT, you will have to edit the printenv script to point to your perl binary...
