>Description:
Section 8.2 of the HTTP/1.1 draft states that:

     Upon receiving a method [which can carry a message body] from an
     HTTP/1.1 (or later) client, an HTTP/1.1 (or later) server MUST
     either respond with 100 (Continue) status and continue to read from
     the input stream, or respond with an error status.

   Apache/1.2-dev does not send the 100 Continue message, as far as I
   can tell (in particular by typing a direct HTTP/1.1 POST request to
   a running instance).  This is unfortunate, particularly since the
   same section specifies cases in which an HTTP/1.1 client must wait
   for the 100 Continue header before sending any message body
   (retrying a request to an HTTP/1.1 server).
