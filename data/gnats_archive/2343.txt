>Description:
The server status figures about requests/sec and kB/sec that
are provided by mod_status (GET /Status) are averages for the
entire uptime period.

Actually I think it is much more interesting to have real-time
or near real-time status figures.

State-Changed-Why:
'Real-time'?  If you want mean figures, you need to have
an interval over which the data are collected; what
duration would you like?

And please let us know a *specific* version of the server
with which you're seeing this; "all" isn't acceptable..

 A minute... 5 minutes... something like that! Not the full
 week of uptime I get usually.

 I've seen this in 1.3b7 and 1.2.4 but I guess the 'problem'
 has been there always.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the additional information.  We're closing up
1.3 at the moment (it's frozen), so I'm marking this
report for consideration during the next feature cycle.
