Win95 OSR2, VC 5.0
>Description:
If you do
            AddAlias /Some/Dir/ c:/Real/Dir/

then a request for http://my.host.dom/Some/Dir will fail; however if you use

            AddAlias /some/dir/ c:/Real/Dir/

the same request works.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a directory with a name containing a leading uppercase character, then
make an alias to it using the leading uppercase character.
>Fix:
Personally, I'd just document it and not worry about it

State-Changed-When: Wed Sep 10 18:12:05 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Apache 1.3a1 has some problems dealing with the case-insensitive nature of Windows filesystems, which likely led to your problem. This has been fixed in 1.3b1, to be released shortly.

Also, I'm assuming that you meant Alias, not AddAlias, since the latter is not a valid Apache directive.

Thanks!
