Linux eclectic 2.0.33 #2 Wed Apr 8 23:33:10 EDT 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
When you do a 'make install' w/ 1.3b6, it will install the 'it works!' web pages
(index.html, apache_pb.gif, manual/) regardless of whether or not 'index.html'
already exists.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do a 'make install' with the htdocs directory being your main HTML root.
>Fix:
Check for existing 'index.html', and if it exists, don't install HTML files
