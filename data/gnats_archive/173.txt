FreeBSD 2.1, gcc
>Description:
using
 ProxyRemote https http://ios.internet-ireland.ie:8080
in http.conf doesn't seem to have any effect; the proxy
seems to try to tunnel directly to the server requested.
 
This probably isn't really a bug; it's just that we have
a few subnets with firewalls and it would make things
easier to administer if this would work. We have quite
restrictive routing for security purposes.
>How-To-Repeat:
set up two proxies and see whether one will tunnel https
through to the other.
>Fix:
I'm not very knowledgable about the code; I'll get back
to you once I've developed some understanding of it

State-Changed-Why:
The CONNECT mode specification states that the HTTPS proxy
should not connect on ports other than the 'well-known' port
numbers for HTTPS (443) and SNEWS (563). This should work
OK if the ProxyPass target connect is made on port 443.

as recommended.
