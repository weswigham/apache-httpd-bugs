RH6.1
>Description:
This bug only occurs in mod_proxy when CacheRoot is not set.
When a client aborts a transfer prematurely, mod_proxy should abort reading
the proxied content.

Instead, it keeps reading (for the non-existant cache) which just lands in the
bit bucket.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download a very large proxied file, and abort the connection prematurely.
Watch mod_proxy continue recieving it.
