Note the differing occurance of the content-type headers for the 2 versions 
(the one on top is apache 1.1.3, bottom is 1.2b6)  Configuration files are based
off sample config files for each release.

State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 21 14:42:00 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Do you have any AddType directives for .gz or a mime-type
for .gz files in your mime.types file?  If so, that will
override the content-encoding.
State-Changed-From-To: analyzed-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sun Apr 27 14:40:13 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This doesn't happen with an out-of-the-box 1.2b9 (didn't try
anything earlier).  So I suspect you have an AddType or a definition
in your mime.types file that is causing this.

Thanks for using Apache!
