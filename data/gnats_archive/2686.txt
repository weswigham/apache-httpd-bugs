>Description:
If AddHandler defines a handler for a file extension for the whole server,
and an Action is also defined for the same extension locally (via .htaccess), 
then the handler overrides the action.

>How-To-Repeat:
In srm.conf, to make entire site's .html files SSI parsed:

AddHandler server-parsed .html

In a particular directory's .htaccess, for particular parsing of .html files by a script:

AddType text/mytype .html
Action text/mytype /script/to/parse/with.cgi
>Fix:
 - Have Action's override handlers.
 - Have Actions supplement handlers (ie; handle it, then pass on the output to the action)
 - Allow Handlers to be easily disabled (RemoveHandler ??)
 - Clearly document AddHandler versus Actions, caveats, adaptations, etc ...
