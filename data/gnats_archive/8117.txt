Red Hat Linux 6.2 
"uname -a" gives an output as "Linux web 2.2.14-5.0smp #1 SMP Tue Mar 7 21:01:40 EST 2000 i686"
>Description:
I have installed apache_1.3.20 with mod_ssl 2.8.4 and openssl 0.9.6a on Linux 6.2. and everything workes fine upto this point. Now, I want to plugin Jakarta-tomcat with this apache webserver as my application is developed on tomcat. But wafter including a tomcat-apache.conf file and trying to start apache, it comes up with an error like "Systax Error at line 1 of tomcat-apache.conf Invalid command 'LoadModule' perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration".

In tomcat-apache.conf, First line is like this "LoadModule jserv_module libexec/mod_jserv.so". And I have mod_jserv.so available in apache/libexec which I downloaded from apache's website (as it is downloaded from website).

As this thing didn't work, I downloaded mod_jk.so and placed it in apache/libexec (as it is downloaded from website) and changed httpd.conf to include mod_jk.conf-auto and tried to start apache, but it ended up with the same result. ( giving error for LoadModule).

Let me know whether I need to do anything special in Apache to let it accept "LoadModule" directive. I checked "httpd -l" and it show mod_so.c and http_core.c as already loaded modules.

thanks in advance,

Kalpen
