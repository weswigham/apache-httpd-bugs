      set_vlist_validator(r, r);

When handling multiview, If there's no files matching, it could set request's
modified time (r->mtime) to unknown value. To prevent this, there should be 
a check for validity of r->finfo (or number of matches) before calling
set_vlist_validator().

Since r->mtime is checked against If-Modified-Since value, so if there's any
other module generating something without Last-Modified header, the check could
possibly fail.
