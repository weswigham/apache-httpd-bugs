>Description:
Uncommenting the line "ProxyRequests on" causes a runtime error.  I have added 
LoadModule proxy_module modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll to the end of the access.conf 
file.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: pcs
State-Changed-When: Fri Oct 17 04:21:14 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The LoadModule directive must occur at the start of
httpd.conf. The module is not loaded into Apache until
this directive is processed, so all directives handled by
the module will give a configuration error if they occur
before the LoadModule line.
