This is a dup of bug 5998, but for some obscure reason this bug is closed.

When proxying a URL containing a canonicalized '%' (percent sign) apache returns 400 - Bad Request. Examining the mod_proxy source code reveals that in proxy_util.c in function ap_proxy_canonenc() the to-be-canonicalized string is *first* decoded if a percent-sign is present and the 'isenc' parameter not is NOT_PROXY. Any URL with a percent-sign in it is effectively decanonicalized twice, as can be observer by passing in a URL with '%2525' in the path (on first decode '%25'; then '%' remains. Any other URL is correctly decoded on the first pass, but second decode attempt fails because the '%' is probably not followed by two hex digits; or if there are two hex digits the entire URL now becomes invalid.

PS. I've made the following patch: in proxy_util.c changed the  
if (isenc != NOT_PROXY && ch == '%') into a more strict
if (t!=enc_path && isenc != NOT_PROXY && ch == '%')
This *seems* to work, but I cannot oversee the overall consequences of this change. Please advise.
>How-To-Repeat:
When using mod_proxy to pass '/' to another machine, go to:

http://your.server.name/%25

or anything with the escaped percent sign in it.
