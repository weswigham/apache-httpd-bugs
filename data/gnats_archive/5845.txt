RedHat 6.1 install, rebuilt kernel:
Linux toro1 2.2.14 #6 SMP Tue Mar 7 15:58:11 PST 2000 i686 unknown
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
>Description:
httpd reads content and writes logs to an NFS server.  Added LockFile
directive for local disk (/tmp) but the file is never created.

httpd.conf =
   ...
   ServerType standalone
   ServerRoot "/sf/platform/linux/apache"
   LockFile /tmp/httpd_toro1.lock
   PidFile /sf/logs/httpd/httpd_toro1.pid
   ...
   CustomLog /sf/logs/httpd/access_log_toro1 common
   ...

Access log gets written as expected, then suddenly (with no activity)
gets truncated - back to 0 bytes.

Searched database, saw many suggestions to use LockFile directive but
also many statements to the effect that USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
is broken...
>How-To-Repeat:
try running with logs on NFS disk, RH6.1 linux 2.2.14 and specify LockFile
see anything?
>Fix:
Log to local disk.  Not very satisfactory.
