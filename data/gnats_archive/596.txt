>Description:
If you configure a ServerName which is not available from the DNS (yet)
then the server will refuse to start. This is unacceptable from the point
of view of setting up services for customers. The server should start
(but possibly complain) if the DNS does not match the configuration.
Otherwise customers cannot try out their service before DNS has been
set up.
>How-To-Repeat:
configure a name into ServerName which is not in the DNS
>Fix:
Yes, in http_main.c

void default_server_hostnames(server_rec *s)
{
    struct hostent *h;
    struct in_addr *main_addr;
    int num_addr;
    char *def_hostname;
    int n;
    server_addr_rec *sar;
    int has_default_vhost_addr;
    int mainport = s->port;
    int from_local=0;

    /* Main host first */

    if (!s->server_hostname) {
        s->server_hostname = get_local_host(pconf);
        from_local = 1;
    }

    def_hostname = s->server_hostname;
    h = gethostbyname(def_hostname);
    if( h == NULL ) {
        fprintf(stderr,"httpd: cannot determine the IP address of ");
        if (from_local) {
           fprintf(stderr,"the local host (%s). Use ServerName to set it manuall
y.\n",
                s->server_hostname ? s->server_hostname : "<NULL>");
        } else {
           fprintf(stderr,"the specified ServerName (%s).\n",
                s->server_hostname ? s->server_hostname : "<NULL>");
        };
        /* :jb don't drop out if DNS check fails
                doesn't look like we need the rest of this function
                if DNS check doesn'twork.
        exit(1);
        */
        return;
    }

***** SWAP the exit(1); for return; as noted

State-Changed-Why:
That ServerName is absolutely required.  That particular call
is used only for the global ServerName directive, so it should
not affect virtual hosts at all (well it does indirectly, but
not in a manner that stops httpd from starting).  See the
DNS Issues and Virtual Hosts in Depth pages linked off the
<VirtualHost> documentation.

Unless you're really setting up an individual apache for
each customer.  In which case you can work around this
quite easily.  Use "ServerName localhost" and then proceed
to set up a server with exactly one VirtualHost, and
follow the tips on the DNS Issues page.
