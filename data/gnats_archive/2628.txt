>Description:
The following archive libraries are built in the Apache source tree:

./src/ap/libap.a
./src/main/libmain.a
./src/modules/standard/libstandard.a
./src/os/unix/libos.a
./src/regex/libregex.a

It's not clear why shared library versions (e.g. .so or .sl) aren't built
too, for linking against the main binaries.
>How-To-Repeat:
Affects the build of all systems. The final httpd binary with no extra
modules is over 300K. With shared library versions, this would reduce
dramatically (maybe only 32K ?) and would also save memory usage surely ?
>Fix:
Allow the configuration to build shared, archive or both types of libraries.
May need to re-link during the install in a similar way that GNU's libtool
has to. Only downer on this would be a slightly slower startup time for the
first httpd, but once the shared libraries are in memory, subsequent startup
times would be faster (though still a little slower than the .a versions).
Presumably there's some technical reason why httpd can't link against shared
library versions of its own code (can't think of one...), because this
suggestion sounds "way too obvious" to me otherwise !

State-Changed-Why:
You will save very little by making the Apache libraries
shared libraries; the only savings would be if you had
two different httpd binaries both using the same shared
libraries, and even then the savings would be minimal.

The main point of shared libraries isn't to reduce memory
use, since modern operating systems will magically share
pages in many cases, especially the way Apache works, but to
make maintainence and upgrading easier.  That doesn't really
apply to the Apache core and would create untold confusion
when people try upgrading and don't get all the shared
libraries, etc.

So thanks for the suggstion, but I really don't see the benefit of it
and the complexity and support hassles are quite large.
