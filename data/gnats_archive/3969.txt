Hi,

As a security analyst, I've been studying your Apache NTX Enhanced
WebServer System. In doing this, I was trying to find holes in your security. I just wanted to let you know that I did find one.

It seems that anyone can have read access to the remote server's cgi-bin directory. This can lead to compromise of the remote machine if certain cgi's are found on the system. 

I found this hole by doing a security check on one of the sites you host. The site in question is www.estock.com. By utilizing NetCraft's (www.netcraft.com) WebServer Check I noticed that www.estock.com is running Apache/1.2.4 ( ntx enhanced server - referer/agent 1.0d6 ).

This means that this server is vulnerable to breaches in security. Properly exploited, these breaches on the cgi-level of security could lead to a root compromise of your entire system.

I would be happy to discuss this and/or other matters of security with you. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best regards,

>How-To-Repeat:
www.estock.com/cgi-bin is world readable, giving adversaries the possibility of
browsing through the cgi-bin directory and finding out critical information about the system.
>Fix:
The only easy solution that I see is to chmod 700 on the cgi-bin directory

Erm... people using Apache can setup their system however
they want.  If they choose to do so in an insecure manner,
there really isn't much that we can do about that.
