>Description:
How can I restricted all access to my apache server?
I basically want to have the user prompt for a userid/password when they first 
access any page on the server (and be validated for the current session only).

Adding a .htaccess in every directory is not viable for maintenance reason.

Having group would also be interesting.

Thanks
Andre

State-Changed-Why:
Well, if you want to restrict access then do it.  If you look
at the docs and the sample config files, it shouldn't be too
hard.

If you put a .htaccess file in a directory, then it applies
to that directory and all directories below it, so just put one
in your top level directory and it will work fine.

Alternatively, put it in your *.conf files inside a
Directory section that applies to your entire site.
