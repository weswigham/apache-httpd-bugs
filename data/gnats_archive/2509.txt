Windows 95 without any Network.
>Description:
I have a laptop with Windows 95 without network, I installed the TCPI/IP and becouse I have no network I just gived a "200.200.200.200" IP address.
The probles is that when I run apache 1.3b6 it says : httpd cannot find the host name please use the servername. So I wrote in httpd.conf servername locolhost.
So apache run normally but when I use the IE 3.0 and I write for example:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/test.pl it or 
http://200.200.200.200/cgi-bin/test.pl it just answer me: IE cannot open the site...
Now the point is:
It is really possible to install the Apache 1.3b6 for a laptop without Network?
If it is possible, wath do I have to write in those config files (http.conf, acces.conf)?
Do I have to istall the Network program or ITCP/IP even if I don't have any phisical Networ?
Please help me to understand. Regards Massimo Nardone
