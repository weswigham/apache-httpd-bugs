 Are you using the Redhat RPM?  If so, toss it out the window and install
 the distributed source tree or take this up with them; I have seen many
 reports of their RPM doing this when it shouldn't, and the base source
 tree _is_ configured to return the proper mime-type.

 No, I mean the real Apache tree available from http://www.apache.org/dist/
 
 I have no idea what RedHat did to theirs to break this, but they have done
 very bogus things in the past.
 
 Note that the paths for various things are different with the RedHat RPM
 and the unmodified source.

Broken RedHat problem.  No idea how they managed to break
something as simple as this.
