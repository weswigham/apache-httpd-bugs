>Environment:
AIX 4.1.5 
Apache 1.3.6 compiled with gcc 2.7.2 to replace NCSA 1.5.2
>Description:
We protect a directory with a .htaccess file which points to .htpasswd and 
.htgroup files. It works properly but gives error messages in the log file, like

[Wed May  5 15:36:20 1999] [error] [client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] user alain not found: 
/ggg/ci/..

(Note the  ending "..")
This happens when trying to access the directory 

http://domain/ggg/ci

despite the fact that the authentification works well and the contents of
the directory are shown. The same message appears again each time the page
is reloaded, even if no authentification is asked anymore.

However, if the same is tried but a particular file is accessed, say 

http://domain/ggg/ci/bla.html

no error message appears.

The user "alain" is listed in .htgroup as a member of group "ci" and 
in .htpasswd.
The same error message would appear with a user which would not exist (but
then access is really denied).

*** .htaccess in /ggg/ci ***
AuthUserFile  /out_the_tree/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /out_the_tree/.htgroup
AuthName ci
AuthType Basic

<Limit GET>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from .umh.ac.be
require group ci
</Limit>
*** .htgroup ***
ci: alain yves chantal jean monique marianne ci 
*** .htpasswd ***
alain:T..........w
(...)
>How-To-Repeat:
This happens in a part of our site not accessible from outside. 
Besides the only visible effects are in the log file.
>Fix:
The ending ".." appearing in the error message following the directory name 
might be a key to understand the problem.

State-Changed-Why:

Do you have an index.html file (or whatever you've
specified in your DirectoryIndex directive) in the
directory?  If not, try putting one there.  Or try
giving the server's user read access to /ggg.  I
suspect that mod_autoindex may be getting involved.

 Actually, if I put an index.html file in the directory, 
 the message doesn't appear anymore (the same as if I would 
 request a particular file). It is only when I really want 
 to see the index as is that the "problem" happens.
 
 The server's user has already read access to this directory.
 Again, the thing works, the only funny thing is the logged 
 message.

What do you see for the following:

ls -lgd /ggg/ci
ls -lgd /ggg
ls -lgd /

?
