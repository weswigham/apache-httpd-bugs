RedHat 6.1, kernel 2.2.12-20
>Description:
After building Tomcat, downloading mod_jserv.so, editing the httpd.conf, I type apchectl start.
Apache starts and I can access it fine.
But http://localhost/examples doesn't work.
Checking the mod_jserv.log, it contains the error:
    (EMRGENCY) ajp12: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007
>How-To-Repeat:
Build Tomcat
Include tomcat.conf in http.conf which in turn will LoadModule mod_jserv.so
apachectl restart
