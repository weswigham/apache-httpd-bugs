>Unformatted:
	Further enhancement to mod_autoindex...

	I've added TARGET="_self" to the emit_link function... this causes
the sorted output to open in the same window as it was called from. This
doesn't affect non-framed pages, and within frames, it means the output
will always be in the source frame, even if the HEADER.html has a <BASE
TARGET="..."> line directing other links elsewhere.

	I can't think of any reason why this would be undesirable.

	Following is the diff of that function:

***************
*** 753,759 ****
      qvalue[4] = '\0';
      reverse = ((curkey == fname) && (curdirection == D_ASCENDING));
      qvalue[3] = reverse ? D_DESCENDING : D_ASCENDING;
!     rvputs(r, "<A HREF=\"", qvalue, "\">", anchor, "</A>", NULL);
  }

  static void output_directories(struct ent **ar, int n,
