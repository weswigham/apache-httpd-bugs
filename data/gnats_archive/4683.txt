>Organization:
>Environment:
NT 4.0 at 1.3.4 w/out patches.
>Description:
getting password mismatch errors in logs and cannot acces htaccess protected directory with valid pw.
>How-To-Repeat:
www.extremeorgasm.com click members and enter test with password test.
>Fix:
if clear test is entered instead of the script generated encrypted pw works fine.  Really just want to know if its not supported.  I thought I understood from your notes on 1.3.6 that the problem was not in 1.3.4 but after downgrading problem still persisted.  Will this be fixed in a future release?

State-Changed-When: Sun Oct  1 13:07:18 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Apache Win32 will not accept crypt()ed passwords.  It will
accept MD5/SHA1/plain passwords.

If an .htpasswd file is created/edited on unix with the
normal defaults, it is not usable under win32.
