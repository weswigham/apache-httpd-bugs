>Description:
First, I am quite happy with the new arrangement in spawning of new "servers"
provided in Apache 1.3.

I have been attempting to tune my parameters a bit using the error_log output
of the "server seems busy" messages.  The information points to a number of
different causes and is a bit vague.  With a little change this message
would be far more useful.

It would be VERY helpful if the error message indicated: (1) # active servers,
(2) # idle servers at the time the message is generated.  Thus one could more
easily determine if my Max or Min spare servers need adjustment and by
how much.

Put more information into the error log message (in main/http_main.c?%2
