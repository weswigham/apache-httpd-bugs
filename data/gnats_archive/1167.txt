>Description:
I down loaded
  ftp://ftp.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs/repository.tar.gz
as mentioned in 
  http://dev.apache.org/devnotes.html
and I noticed that there are many .# files in the CVSROOT.
At my site we have CVS configured to preclude commiting in the
presence of such files, since they usually indicate somebody
hasn't thought thru the conflict he's in the midst of.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the tip, but those .# files are in the CVSROOT directory
of the repository, which is managed by cvs ... and cvs creates
them as part of it's normal operation.  None of our source code
is in there.

The existance of a .# file in a working copy does not mean there
was a conflict, it just means that a merge occured.  So it'd be
a little draconian to disallow commits in that case.  Testing for
<<<<<<<<, ========, or >>>>>>>> would be much better.
