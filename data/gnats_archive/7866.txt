>Description:
i found no possibility than to run apache manual in a chroot'ed environment or to set the access level for all files and folders to no read/write/execute rights expecting the files i want to have public accessable in order to prevent to give cgi scripts the possibility in reading out all files with the right read for all users.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.hunter23.f2s.com/files.cgi and http://h23.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/files.cgi
here is a script that allows to read out nearly all files from the f2s freespace provider and netfirms, that means all cgi scripts from other users, password files from boards etc.
>Fix:
1. a possibility to run apache in a chroot'ed environment like many ftpds offer
2. the apache would read out .htaccess files also for perl scripts, trying to read out files/folders
3. possibilitiy to set also the rights for folders for cgi scripts (directory directive)

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 13 14:42:31 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Setting file permissions is a function of the OS; by the 
very nature of what CGI is, Apache can't do anything about
it.  Apache can be run chrooted just fine using an external wrapper; it is up to the admin to set it up that way if they so desire.
