>Description:
Please see http://www.libmng.com/webmasters.html
>How-To-Repeat:
MNG/JNG files are available for inspection at:

http://www.libmng.com/JNGsuite/index.html
http://www.libmng.com/MNGsuite/index.html
>Fix:
Add to mime.types:

video/x-mng		mng
image/x-jng		jng

And to magic:

0	string	\x8AMNG\x0d\x0a\x1a\x0a		video/x-mng
0	string	\x8BJNG\x0d\x0a\x1a\x0a		image/x-jng

The magic file is untested - please compare against the JNG and MNG image
test suites.

 We have a policy of only adding mime types that have been allocated by
 IANA, and I cannot find these types in the list of allocations at
 ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/image/
 
 If you want us to add these types, please ask IANA to allocate
 official mime types first.
 
 Thanks for your bug report.
 
 Tony.

 But the offical list doesn't mention such chestnuts as
 image/x-portable-anymap which is in *my* mime.types file... there are a
 whole load of entries in mime.types that aren't IANA registered. Where di
 they come from?!?!?

 There are a load of types which are there for historical reasons and
 they have to remain for reasons of backward compatibility. We only
 *add* IANA-registered types, but that doesn't mean we remove types
 that aren't IANA-registered.

State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended
State-Changed-By: abagchi
State-Changed-When: Fri Jul 28 12:43:03 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Closing because of e-mail conversation with user.  The mime
types requested aren't currently registered with IANA, if and
when they are, we will look at this again.
State-Changed-From-To: suspended-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug  7 06:46:41 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

We are happy to entertain any new mime types added by IANA
to the defaults distributed with Apache.  We periodically
look at the registered mime extensions list, and would be
happy to receive notification that these have occured.
In the meantime, I'm closing this report as a premature
request.
