I can watch my servlet write data into the output stream, but this data is not being flushed form JServ to Apache. Should out.close() in JServConnection.java be servlet_out.close() instead? Switch this fixes my problem. 

> From JServConnection.java...

                if (servlet_writer != null) { 
                    servlet_writer.close();
                }
                out.close;

change to:
                if (servlet_writer != null) { 
                    servlet_writer.close();
                } else
                    servlet_out.close();
  
Why is this loop needed in the JServOutputStream close function?

        public void close() throws IOException {
            int l;
            do {
                l = in.available();
                in.skip(l);
            } while (l > 0);
            
            sendHttpHeaders();
            out.close();

The page that is giving me trouble has data available on it.

 +1 on the patch. However the real reason that pages was empty was that
 the servlet author didn't close the output. So this patch actually
 closes the output for him, and corrects his mistake.

 It's a "linger on close" feature.
 
 The loop is to protect that your data will be received by the browser
 even if you haven't received all the input stream. In case you have
 unread data waiting for being received in the socket, and you close the
 socket, depending on the operating system your output data that are
 buffered in the socket may get lost. Many OS'es assume "no SO_LINGER" as
 a default policy, setting socket options sometimes has no effect in
 JVM's. So this is safe way to go around this problem. AFAIK Costin
 suggested that calling available() is enough, but this seem to be safer.
