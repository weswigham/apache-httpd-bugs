>Description:
I freely admit that I am a novice at CGI scripting, PERL, and higher
level HTML coding.  So it's possible I'm doing something wrong here,
but I cannot find any problem in my code.  I have a PERL script to
send documents to users via "Content-type: application/octet-stream",
with a "Content-disposition: filename=whatever" line immediately
following.  The name that is suggested to the user when the file
is received, is not "whatever", but the name of the script that
created the HTML code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Please examine: http://www.en.com/users/ljduchez/cgi-bin/sendbin.pl,
a generic PERL script to send files to users.  You may call this
PERL script from http://www.en.com/users/ljduchez/sendbin.html; when
the selected file is sent, it will take on the name "sendbin.pl".

State-Changed-Why:
This doesn't seem like a server problem; it seems to me 
that some clients simply don't listen to it.  There
is nothing the server can do about it.  Do you have any
reason for thinking it is a server problem?

State-Changed-Why:
If *any* browsers are working properly and reproducibly
with this information, then the server is sending it
correctly and the problem lies with the browsers.  The
script pages you reference no longer exist, and you say
that Mozilla works reliably with this construct, so it
appears that this *is* a browser problem and you have
found a workaround.  Thank you for using Apache!
