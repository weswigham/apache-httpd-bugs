Using the form UserDir d:/*/public_html does not work and I believe
it has something to do with the function ap_os_is_path_absolute()
in win32/os.h not checking for drive names.

I have no compiler and can't verify.

State-Changed-Why:
ap_os_is_path_absolute now checks for drive specification.
I tried this on my Win95 system and it worked.  Please
try this again with the latest version of Apache and
let us know if it works for you now.

Thanks for using Apache!
