On my workstation I have installed gcc and the native c anc c++ compilers of IBM.
>Description:
The problem is described in the Errorreport #3379. 
The solution given there CFLAGS=_LONG_LONG; configure doesn't help in anyway.
If I do that the configure script crashes with this error message:

gcc: _LONG_LONG: No such file or directory
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 1.
