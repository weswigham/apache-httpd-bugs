>Description:
I'm using the server as a proxy. When a you attempt to go to this url 

http://199.97.97.163/IMDS%PMANAT0%read%/home/content/users/imds/feeds/comtex/2000/09/11/pr/0000-3930-ok-gothic-energy

the apache server returns a 400 error. How ever if you access the url without proxy it works.

My guess is that the % in the url is causing the 400 error message.

Do you know if this is a problem with apache mod_proxy and if so is there a fix.

State-Changed-Why:
That is not a valid URL.  "%" is a special character that needs to
be encoded.  Any software generating this URL is broken.
