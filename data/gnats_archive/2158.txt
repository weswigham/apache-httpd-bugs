There is no support for shared objects on NetBSD.
Even if needed compile flags are guessed correctly, it's
mandatory to hand-edit src/os/unix/os.h to be able to actually
load the shared module.
>How-To-Repeat:
try to compile Apache with shared objects on NetBSD
>Fix:
There is an unified patch which adds support for NetBSD at
http://www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek/NetBSD/apache13_netbsd_dso
