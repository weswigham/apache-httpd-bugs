>Description:
A few months ago I build a webserver for the coop. I work for. It looks like this:
Server Version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 mod_ssl/2.4.8 OpenSSL/0.9.4
Server Built: Nov 16 1999 09:25:57

This works fine, but since some of these version are out dated now and because 
I wanted to include mod_auth_mysql, which I also use at home together with mod_ssl and php3 (no problems here).
But every time I start the new server and want to test it all the cgi's and
the server-status url come up with a 403. :(

Even compiling exactly the same server again fails, the old one dates from when
the box was nonsmp, since it is smp no apache has yet been succesfully used exempt the old one
(which was compiled on a pII350 nonsmp system, but also works with changes on the smp system)

I would like to know if this problem comes with apache or with an other module
I'm compiling with it ?
(I'm thinking its smp related, although I'm praying that I'm wrong)
>How-To-Repeat:
Somewhere in this step-by-step it fails (no error, but de bugs come when running)
