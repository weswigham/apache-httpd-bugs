State-Changed-Why:
I can't reproduce this with a 1.3 server, and I doubt there
were any related changes between 1.2 and 1.3.  You'll have to
do a bit more digging for us.  My suspicion is that you've got
a CGI which doesn't like having the disk full, and the CGI
is causing problems.  If you can get back to a disk full
situation and get the server into this problem then what
would be nice is:

- ps -auxww | grep httpd
- run ktrace against a few of the httpd children to see what
  they're doing
- see if you've got any CGIs hanging around

Thanks
Dean

State-Changed-Why:
Error caused by external program blocking and not reading
its input.  Note even the new 1.3 code for reliable piped
logging can't work around this -- the logger has to read
its input religiously.

 Ah, that pretty much explains it.  There is a 4k pipe buffer, when it's
 full all tasks writing the pipe are blocked.  My guess is that cronolog is
 not reading its input when the disk is full.  You'll have to get cronolog
 fixed -- it has to continue reading its input even when the disk is full.

 	Ok Dean, thanks. I didn't see this before I wrote the other one.
 This explains it completely.  Thanks.
 
 	Andrew, is there something you can do if the disk is full to just
 /dev/null the output until its time to rotate the logs.  Then if there is
 room free at that time continue, else /dev/null it again?  
 
 	Thanks Dean and Andrew.
