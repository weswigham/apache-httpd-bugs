>Description:
Ctrl-C in Apache window causes main child thread to terminate. Terminating the main child thread means the child terminate handler doesn't get called.

OS2 has this code, is there a parallel for Windows?
#ifdef OS2
/* Stop Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break signals going to child processes */
    {
        unsigned long ulTimes;
        DosSetSignalExceptionFocus(0, &ulTimes);
    }
#endif
>How-To-Repeat:
Ctrl-C apache and notice that your child exit handler isn't called.

State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 16 20:18:32 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

The exception handling was overhauled for Apache 1.3.13,
including Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break events.  It has been further
cleaned up for Apache 2.0.  Please try the forthcoming
Apache 1.3.13 release for the resolution, and if not
completely satisfied, Apache 2.0 will offer far more
reliability under Windows.
