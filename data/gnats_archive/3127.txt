>Description:
I would like to request three things! 

One: That you make an extra make install option that does not set suexec to root.
This is so that when I or any other person that trys a make not as root
they do not get errors. Grant this only happens with suexec enabled.

Two: What I do right now is configure and make apache as a normal user. And then
as root type make install. Until last night I would have to edit the httpd.conf
file to change the port, but last night I found out that you can type "make 
install conf_port="80". But what I would like to request is that you add 
conf_user like you have conf_group so that at install time you can replace
no only the port and the group but also the user! That is a one line change in
the Makefile.tmpl file.

Three: I would like you to add a rpm.spec file the root of your distro. This 
would standardize the apache rpm's that are out there!	 
>How-To-Repeat:
These are only request they are not really bugs! :) (As all the apache developers
wipe there brow in relief!) 
>Fix:
For One: Just put a if statment around the suexec install statements so I can
define something like suexecnoroot and have it skip of those 4 statements

For Two: Just add one more sed statement for replaceing the user in the conf
file.

Three: If you implement my first request Here is the spec file to add to the 
root of the distro!

 But not installing suexec as root means it doesn't work.  So, when you want
 suexec it should be installed correctly.  When you can't install it correctly,
 you have to life with this fact and not use --enable-suexec. That's why we've
 added this APACI option and made it not the default.  When one is able to
 install suexec he can enable it. So, IMHO it's not reasonable to change this
 here.

 Seems like you didn't read the INSTALL as carefully as you should or I do not
 understand your request correctly.
 
  ``Use the --without-confadjust option to explicitly disable some built
  user/situation dependent adjustments to the config files (Group, Port,
  ServerAdmin, ServerName, etc.).  This is usually only interesting for
  vendor package maintainers who wants to force the keeping of defaults.''
 
 Isn't this what you want?

 I'm not very familiar of RPM spec files, so cannot comment on it.  But at
 least I'm sure it isn't useful to include it directly to the distribution
 root. A subdir like src/support/ is more appropriate for it, isn't it? OTOH
 I'm not sure whether the Apache Group really should add such a spec file.
 Because else we have to add SVR4 pkg files, FreeBSD ports, Debian dpkg files,
 too. So, I don't think it's reasonable to include such a RPM spec file to the
 official distribution.  But you can place it on our FTP server under the
 contrib/ section.  There it would be fine.
