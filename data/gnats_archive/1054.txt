>Description:
The AuthGroupFile and AuthUserFile simply don't work in the access.conf
file.  When I specify filenames for them, I get an error message when I
start apache 1.2.0 saying that AuthGroupFile and AuthUserFile are illegal.
Without those directives in access.conf, it is not possible to verify
users for certain directories/documents.  This is very frustrating.  I
have also tried to use the deny and allow commands within a pair of
<Directory>...</Directory> tags in access.conf.  I deny from all and
then allow from certain IP numbers (with the order deny,allow), but that
doesn't work either.  Even though I allow my own IP, apache 1.2.0 won't
let me into the protected directory.  This has become very, very frustrating
and has wasted a lot of my time.  I switched to Apache to make things
a bit easier, more flexible, configurable.  I was using the old EIT server
(NCSA style), which worked fine as far as it went; it protected a special
directory but let me enter, according to the allow,deny segment in the
access.conf.  I tried the same with Apache and it simply doesn't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
No way to repeat it through a URL  It's a config. problem.

I have no idea

Reading your bug report this looks all like configuration
problems to me.
The best place to find help with configuring Apache
is the newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
(and of course the Apache documentation).

If you think you've found a bug in Apache you are
welcome to submit an other bug report, but please
include some configuration details next time.
