GCC .. compiles .. installs etc without any problem. 
>Description:
I have included an ExecCGI in the options for the directory in question as so - 

<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/mail">
        Options ExecCGI
        AllowOverride None
        SetHandler cgi-script
</Directory>

I have also added the handler for CGIs in httpd.conf as so - 

    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

I have also added a .htaccess file with the following - 

RewriteEngine on 
RewriteBase /usr/local/apache/htdocs/mail/ 
RewriteRule ^quux\.cgi$ - [T=application/x-httpd-cgi] 

And after all this I still get the CGI server as ascii instead of executed server side. the permissions are correct, and if I copy all files straight into /cgi-bin/ it works fine.. I do not normally post bug reports especially for something as simple as this. I do this kind of thing so often that it strike me as very odd that its not working now. 

I am almost positive this has something to do with FreeBSD 4.3 which is the only thing different between this box and others which are working fine on FreeBSD 4.2 and older versions of apache.  When I installed FreeBSD 4.3 it asked for a security setting and I went for the default (medium). I have since put this to low to no avail.

and
http://www.dragnet.net.au/cgi-bin/mail/simple.cgi

(Simple script to show env variables) 
>Fix:
Find out what FreeBSD security settings affect? i've tried everything from copying the configs of working apache servers from other boxes to this one with no luck.. ive tried setting up virtual hosts with the ExecCGI options etc and the vhosts work fine (so httpd.conf is being used...) but the cgi never does. 

I'll say it again.. I dont send bug reports like this willy nilly.. but this particular case has got me muddled. If there is something incompatible with freebsd 4.3 then you guys should probably know about it... im tearing my hair out.. such a simple thing.. I might have to install freebsd4.2 in the meantime :/
