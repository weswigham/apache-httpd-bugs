>Description:
When you load for example a /17 worth of vhosts (aka 16384 vhosts), the memory usage of apache will rise unacceptible high.
A configuration containing 16384 vhosts will use 283 mb of (shared) memory.
IP hash statistics say:
[Fri Nov  2 09:48:11 2001] [debug] http_vhost.c(328): iphash: total hashed = 16385, avg chain = 16, chain lengths (count x len): 1x128 127x126 127x2 1x1 768x0

State-Changed-Why:

In a situation like this, you really need to use mod_vhost_alias or a similar technique so that you don't bulk up your httpd.conf with thousands of individual vhost blocks.  That module is specifically designed to solve your problem.

Thanks for using Apache!

 mod_vhost_alias doesn't support suexec. Your answer doesn't solve
 the problem of eating up a lot of memory with large configurations.
 I would like to have this bug report reopened and have it looked at
 seriously.

 Your configuration isn't large; it's enormous.  It is part of Apache's basic
 architecture that it must read the configuration tree into memory.  There is
 nothing that can be done about that.
 
 I'll happily reopen the report, but nobody is going to be able to fix this.
 You might try looking at cgiwrap or some other architecture for your site.

 There isn't anything to look at.  If you want the flexibility of Apache's
 configuration syntax, then it requires a lot of memory for each vhost.  
 
 You can minimize this by setting as few directives as possible within each
 vhost (move defaults outside, to the main server config), but a bunch of
 memory is still required.  If your OS can gracefully handle a lot of
 shared pages between processes, this isn't much of a problem.  If your OS
 can't handle it... there isn't much we can do.
