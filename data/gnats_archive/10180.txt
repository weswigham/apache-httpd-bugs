Linux traxus 2.4.17-grsecurity-1.9.2 #2 Mon Dec 31 14:56:34 EST 2001 i686 unknown

>Description:
I have recently started seeing some very weird entries in my access_log, such as 
the following.  Note that I changed the IP address to "x", and that I definitely 
am not serving the www.maxtor.com web site.

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [14/Mar/2002:09:29:24 -0500] "GET http://www.maxtor.com/ HTTP/1.1" 200 4457 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 95)"

Based on the size of the response alone, it looks like Apache is returning the 
default web page for my site in reponse to this request, though I do not see any 
related requests for images on the default page.  I didn't see anything in the 
documentation which looked like it covered this, nor in the problem report db.

If I repeat the request by telnetting to my site and entering it by hand, I get
the following reponse:

traxus - - [14/Mar/2002:09:59:32 -0500] "GET http://www.maxtor.com/ HTTP/1.1" 400 383 "-" "-"

Any insight?

State-Changed-When: Thu Mar 14 11:21:08 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

This is somebody trying to abuse your webserver as a proxy.
Since they are getting your home page back, it is not working.
To be extra-safe, you should confirm that you don't have
"ProxyRequests On" in httpd.conf.

In the future, questions like this should be addressed to
a user support forum such as the ones listed in the FAQ.

Thanks for using Apache.

 Thank you for your quick response.  I had submitted this to the problem
 report db to confirm that this behavior did not indicate a bug in Apache.
 After all, would it not be more proper to return a 4xx rather than a 200
 and the default page in DocumentRoot in response to a request for a site 
 not hosted by the server?

 - The proper order is "send to user support forum; if you don't get a
 solution there, then file a bug report".  This is clearly stated on the
 bug reporting page.  The reason for this is that we don't have enough
 resources to deal with "real" bugs, let alone "there is some small
 possibility that this may be a bug".
 
 - In fact, apache is responding in the only way it can to these 
 requests.  The server MUST accept absolute URIs (even for ordinary 
 requests) to be compliant with HTTP/1.1.  But apache has no way of 
 knowning all the names that it may be accessed under.  Therefore, it 
 can't, in fact, guarentee that it wasn't meant to serve this request. 
 The only option is to serve it as if it was local.
 
 Have fun.
 
 Joshua.
