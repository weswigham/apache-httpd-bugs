Internet Explorer 4.01 build 4.72.3110.8 for Windows 95.  Apache server on
Red Hat Linux, BSD, Slackware.
>Description:
I encountered a strange bug when trying to communicate between a Java applet and
a CGI under Internet Explorer 4.01 build 4.72.3110.8 for Windows 95.  This is the problem:

The applet connects to a CGI using a URLConnection, then posts some
information, closes the output stream, then open an input stream and begins
to read the output from the CGI.  Sometimes, under internet explorer, if the
CGI is outputting a string like "howdy" (with no endline) the applet
receives "hhhhh".  Basically a repetition of the first byte for the length
of the transmission.  However, the problem occurs unpredicatably and only
with Internet Explorer 4.01 build 4.72.3110.8 for Windows 95.  The problem does not occur under the Netscape web server.
>How-To-Repeat:
The CGI source can be found in "www.sfbootman.com/problem/test.cc"  I also
tried using a perl script with the same result.  That source is:
"www.sfbootman.com/problem/test.pl"  I put a sample applet in the same
directory which can be accessed using "problem.html"  It is set up to
connect to "http://www.sfbootman.com/problem/test.cgi"  Currently test.cgi
is the compiled test.cc ( you can use the perl script if you rename test.pl
to test.cgi)  The source for the java applet is in Problem.java


The output can viewed in the Java console.


test.cc

#include <iostream.h>
#include <string>

main()
{
  string line;

  cout << "Content-type: text/plain" << endl
       << endl;

  getline(cin, line);

  cout << "I got: [" << line << "]" << endl;
}


problem.java

import java.io.*;

import java.applet.*;

import java.awt.*;

import java.net.*;



public class Problem extends Applet

{



	public void init() 

	{	

	}

	

	public void start()

	{

		System.out.println("Beginning Transfer Test...");

		try {

			URLConnection connection = (new URL("http://www.sfbootman.com/problem/test.cgi")).openConnection();

			connection.setDoOutput( true);

			connection.setDoInput( true);



			DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream( connection.getOutputStream());

			output.writeBytes( "Blah Blah Blah\n");

			output.close();



			DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream( connection.getInputStream());

			System.out.println(input.readByte());

			System.out.println(input.readByte());

			System.out.println(input.readByte());



			int x;

			while((x = input.readByte()) > 0)

				System.out.println( x);			

				

			input.close();

		}

		catch (IOException e) { 

			System.out.println(e); 

		}



		System.out.println("Transfer Test Complete.");

	}	

}
