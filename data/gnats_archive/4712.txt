 Aborting!

>How-To-Repeat:
the errors are very consistent.  all you need is apache 1.3.6 on a redhat linux
system with mod_php (3.0.11) installed.  this does not happen with 1.3.4+php
or with 1.3.6 w/o php.
>Fix:
the only error i see is here:
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
ld: cannot open -lpcre: No such file or directory
make: *** [dummy] Error 1
looks like the inclusion of an outside module triggers something in configure
to pass funky arguments to ld that it doesn't recognize?

State-Changed-Why:
For whatever reason, the PHP module is setting things up to
try to include libpcre.  You don't have that library, so
it doesn't work.  As to why the PHP module is doing that,
that is not something that we can answer...
