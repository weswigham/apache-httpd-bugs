>Environment:
Linux 2.0.31 On a Pentium 133, 32meg, gcc 2.7.2.3.
>Description:
I had set up a slew of dns aliases to my server, so I could set up virtual
hosts for individual users, i.e., ballbach.lorien.ml.org would be a virtual
host that would use ~ballbach/public_html as the document root. This was not
dependant on different ip addresses, but different domain names. Now, the first
virtual host is _always_ used, and the normal document root isn't. This problem
does _not_ manifest itself in apache 1.2.4, or lower I suppose. This could be
a feature I guess.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can't, unless you set up domain name aliases on a local machine, and a
virtual host entry. I had to revert to 1.2.4 so it would work right.
>Fix:
No, I assume that the virtual host code no longer basis it's decisions on the
domain name the browser passes it, but resolves it, and if it can answer for the
ip, it does, and uses that default root

Try adding a:

    NameVirtualHost 161.97.204.100

to the start of your config file.  (assuming 161.97.204.100
is the IP they all point to)

Some changes have been made in the name-based virtual
hosting to make it work better, but they aren't yet fully
documented.

 Do you have an explicit ServerName in each of the VirtualHost sections?
 If not try adding one.
 
 If so, please send a sample of the relevant config sections, where
 relevant is something including a number of virtualhost sections and some
 amount of main server config.

 Looks ok.  
 
 Where are you testing this from?  Are you testing it from a client running
 on the same host as the server?  If so, everything is messed up as I just
 discovered after 10 minutes of trying to make this work on my box.
 
 Whatever the cause of your problems, it is almost certainly not your
 fault; the changes to the vhost code are a good thing, but they may
 require a bit of debugging and certainly require more documentation.

 Actually, I'm testing from home, a completely different dialup network.
 Well, if it was a bug, I hope this was helpful. :) Thanks for your help,
 I'll look out for the next version. I almost feel like I'm freeloading,
 anyway, thanks for the service and the great web server you guys provide.

Are you saying that you cannot reach ballbach.lorien.ml.org ?

What URLs exactly are not behaving as you expect?

 Well I'm trying to narrow it down, because I have essentially the same
 config as what you posted running on arctic.org for various dns-based
 virtual domains and I have absolutely no problems with it.  The only
 difference is that I specify the IP address in the <VirtualHost> header. 
 Perhaps you could try changing both the <VirtualHost>s to: 
 
 <VirtualHost 161.97.204.100>
 
 The ServerName is enough to distinguish the servers.
 
 What client are you using to test?
