>Environment:
OS:		Digital Unix 4.0B, no patches.
Compiler:	gcc
>Description:
The web server stops serving documents. Connections continue to be accepted,
however, no data is returned.

This typically lasts about 20 minutes and then goes away.

Killing a child or sending a SIGHUP will cause the server to resume (Signal?)

The parent is typically in a wait call.

The same problem was experienced with 1.1.3

This resembles PR256 which was reported on BSDi


In addition to this, we seem to have hit a limit in virtual servers of about 22
when more than this are confiugred up, you get a 'Can't bind to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'
on the last  VIP in the http.conf file. This also happens with 1.1.3. Chnaging 
the memory allocation size from 8k to 16k increases the number of servers that 
can be configured.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unsure. Generally it seems to happen when the server has been up for more than 
6 hours. however it has also happened a couple of times within this period.	
>Fix:
Chnaging the memory allocation size from 8k to 16k increases the number of 
servers that can be configured.

Unfortunatley,  no other pointers are availible

State-Changed-Why:
There were some fixes made in the 1.2b8 beta that probably
affect the "can't bind" message.  Can you try upgrading to
that version and see whether the problem persists?  Also,
please check the FAQ on the subject of the number of
virtual hosts (<http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ>).
Please let us know what you find..

State-Changed-Why:
The customer reports:

"1.2B8 seems to have fixed this problem. It was a drop
in and work where we had to hack at 1.2b7 to get it going.
The stalling seems to have been fixed by adding
-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALISED_ACCEPT but we have not run it
long enough to be sure yet."

Thank you for the update; please let us know your conclusion
wrt the USE_FCNTL_SERIALISED_ACCEPT.

State-Changed-Why:
Superceded by PR#467 which talks generally of the problem
with multiple Listens and serialized accept.

Thanks for using Apache!
