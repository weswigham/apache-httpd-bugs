>Originator:     doerntge@kiwilogic.com
>Release:        any 1.3 since 1.3.19
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows NT and Windows 2000
downloaded binary package from apache.org ftp server
>Description:
After I installed Apache version 1.3.19 (or .19 or .22), Windows NT (and 2000)
(German Version) shows all filenames in 8.3 Format. Before, I used Apache
version 1.3.9, which had no such problems.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install Apache 1.3.9 first. Then install Apache 1.3.19. Try to run a
CGI-Script from a directory that contains long filenames. Let the script echo
its full path and filename.
Example output: Apache v1.3.9:
  C:\html\Long_Directory_Name\cgi-bin\cgi.bat
Example output: Apache v1.3.19:
  C:\html\Long_D~1\cgi-bin\cgi.bat
>Fix:
No.

 Try this for your shebang line;
 
 #!path/to/prog "%1"
 
 to ask Apache to provide the literal name, quoted, including _spaces_.
