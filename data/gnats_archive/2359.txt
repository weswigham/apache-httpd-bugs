>Description:
htdocs/manual/suexec.html advises:
   COMPILING THE SUEXEC WRAPPER
   You now need to compile the suEXEC wrapper. At the shell command
   prompt, type:  cc suexec.c -o suexec [ENTER]. This should create the
   suexec wrapper executable.

This neglects the include directories.  Try:
   cc suexec.c -o suexec -I../include -I../os/unix

htdocs/manual/suexec.html also advises:
   COMPILING APACHE FOR USE WITH SUEXEC
   By default, Apache is compiled to look for the suEXEC wrapper in the
   following location.

   From src/httpd.h

But the header file in question is really:
   src/include/httpd.h
>How-To-Repeat:
follow instructions as documented.
>Fix:
clean up pathnames, etc, as suggested.
