Unixware 2.1.0, Unixware compiler and libraries
>Description:
On startup server emits:

# Failed to resolve server name for 0.0.0.0 (check DNS)
Failed to resolve server name for 0.0.0.0 (check DNS)

Server sends:
SERVER_NAME=bogus_host_without_reverse_dns
on browser access.

I used the default settings generated by Configure to generate the Makefile 
except changed CC=cc so the correct compiler would be used. 

This worked correctly on previous versions.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start server on Unixware 2.1.0

No

State-Changed-Why:
It sounds like you're using a <VirtualHost a.b.c.d> section
without a ServerName, and a.b.c.d doesn't have valid
reverse DNS.  You'll have to either put in a ServerName or
give it valid reverse DNS.  See the docs linked off of
the virtualhost docs.

Thanks for using Apache!
