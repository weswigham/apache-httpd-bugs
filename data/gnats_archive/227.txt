>Description:
With some browsers it seems that if a CGI script that processes a POST
request sends a 'Location:' header(in order to request one of a small set
of html pages), that some strange browsers than do a POST to these HTML
pages.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I know this is actualy a bug in these browsers, but wouldn't it be a good thing
to internaly convert a POST to a file into a GET if the file is a non cgi file.

State-Changed-Why:
The bug is actually in the browsers that DO convert to
a GET; they should not.  

     Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after receiving
     a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents will
     erroneously change it into a GET request.

Also see section 10.3.4, which describes the 303 response
which does what you want, although older software doesn't
support it.
