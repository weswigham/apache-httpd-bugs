OS: Linux 2.4.17-ulysses1 #1 Sat Dec 29 14:44:46 PST 2001 i686 unknown
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-98)
AMD Duron system

>Description:
Apache is configured with:

./configure  --prefix=/usr/local/httpd2 --enable-modules=all --with-mpm=perchild --disable-vhost-alias --disable-auth-ldap --disable-isapi --disable-suexec --disable-proxy --disable-ssl --disable-ldap --disable-auth-dbm --disable-auth-db

'make' fails in perchild.c with the following error:
perchild.c: In function `perchild_open_logs':
perchild.c:1436: `num_listensocks' undeclared (first use in this function)
perchild.c:1436: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
perchild.c:1436: for each function it appears in.)
perchild.c:1444: `pod' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[4]: *** [perchild.lo] Error 1

Looking at the other MPMs, I deduced that pod was supposed to be declared as ap_pod_t and num_listensocks was a static int. Declaring these as such yielded an error saying that ap_pod_t was undefined, even though the source file that defines it is included by perchild.c

(Furthermore, num_listensocks is only used once in the code -- it has a value assigned to it but nothing ever looks at it. Is there a point in having it?)

note: the num_listensocks problem was already fixed on CVS when I checked, I believe, but the other problems still remain.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm suspending this bug report since the problem is well
known. The perchild MPM should be considered experimental
and may not be implemented by the time 2.0 goes GA.
