That would be a Microsoft question.  I'd suggest you first
query the user support search page;

http://search.microsoft.com/

If that doesn't work, try the developer's page - there is
a too (a bit dangerous) that comes with the .msi SDK, that
will remove _ALL_ installed product info about any product,
presumably even Microsoft's MSI.  Before you do that, I'd
check that the update you downloaded is actually for your
platform!
