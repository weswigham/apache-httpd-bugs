Linux 2.2.14 Apache 1.3.12 mod_perl 1.24 perl 5.6.0
>Description:
When the following is presented in the httpd.conf file:
#
PerlModule Apache::Hello
<Location /hello/world>
 SetHandler perl-script
 PerlHandler Apache::Hello->handler
</Location>
#
Results in the following error_log output:
[Sun Aug  6 21:48:02 2000] [error] 
Undefined subroutine &Apache::Hello->handler::handler 
called at PerlHandler subroutine `Apache::Hello->handler' line 1.

(Opps. . . sorry about testing on Sunday :-)

The following works fine:
<Location /hello/world>
 SetHandler perl-script
 PerlHandler Apache::Hello
</Location>

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Do not automagicly append ::handler to all directive values.
The proper interpretation is presented in the Eagle book 
(Apache Modules - Lincoln Stein:)on page 191.
