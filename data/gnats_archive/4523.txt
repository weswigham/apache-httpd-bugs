Any OS
>Description:
When log_server_status creates its output it uses a two-digit year. The file
name comes from the output of date with the following option:

 date +%y%m%d:%H%M%S

Which results in strings like "990603:165437" for today's date.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the date program
>Fix:
Change the running of date to:

  $date=`date +%Y%m%d:%H%M%S`

Which results in the string "19990603:165633"
