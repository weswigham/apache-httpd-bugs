>Description:
From the error_log: [Sat Aug 22 23:05:39 1998] [warn] (24)Too many open files: unable to open a file descriptor above 15, you may need to increase the number of descriptors

1.3 works great on this machine, 1.3.1 will not even start. Searching the BSDI mailing lists I've seen others
posting the same problem, but no resolutions.
>How-To-Repeat:
Appears to be the default behavior with BSDI 3.x and Apache 1.3.1
>Fix:

>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Aug 23 10:58:55 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Add a "#define HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H" line to the
LINUX section of include/conf.h and recompile.

This is a known problem with another PR or two about it.
It should be fixed in 1.3.2.
