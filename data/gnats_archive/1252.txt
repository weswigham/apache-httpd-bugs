>Description:
Compiling htpasswd.c gets:

gcc -O2 -DSOLARIS2=260 -DSTATUS -I/usr/local/lib htdigest.c -o htdigest -lsocket -lnsl -lpthread -ldb
In file included from ../main/md5c.c:88,
                 from htdigest.c:20:
../main/conf.h:62: os.h: No such file or directory

The Makefile in the directory can be modified to include -I../os/unix but then 
there is a new problem:

gcc -O2 -DSOLARIS2=260 -DSTATUS -I/usr/local/lib  -I../os/unix -I../main   htdigest.c -o htdigest  -lsocket -lnsl -lpthread -ldb
/var/tmp/cc0nF3sg1.o: In function `main':
/var/tmp/cc0nF3sg1.o(.text+0x11c8): undefined reference to `ap_signal'
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
You might be able to only redefine signal() if compiling the server and not
the support programs.
