>Description:
The following does not work:

<VirtualHost 194.6.185.192>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/
  ServerName sourcepole.ch
  ServerAlias *.sourcepole.ch
  DirectoryIndex index.d.xml index.xml index.html
  TransferLog /var/log/apache/sourcepole.ch-access.log
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost 194.6.185.192>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/
  ServerName sourcepole.com
  ServerAlias *.sourcepole.com
  DirectoryIndex index.xml index.d.xml index.html
  TransferLog /var/log/apache/sourcepole.com-access.log
</VirtualHost>

That is, the *transferlog* is split *correctly* when accessing:
  sourcepole.ch, www.sourcepole.ch, sourcepole.com, www.sourcepole.com
but no matter what you access, you allways get index.xml when you access
directory.

If you write the same config the other way round, it works though:

<VirtualHost 194.6.185.192>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/
  ServerName www.sourcepole.ch
  ServerAlias sourcepole.ch
  DirectoryIndex index.d.xml index.xml index.html
  TransferLog /var/log/apache/sourcepole.ch-access.log
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 194.6.185.192>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/
  ServerName www.sourcepole.com
  ServerAlias sourcepole.com
  DirectoryIndex index.xml index.d.xml index.html
  TransferLog /var/log/apache/sourcepole.com-access.log
</VirtualHost>

Thanks,

 It's not a question. It's a configarational inconsistency of Apache.

 I done that. Btw. the bug DB is only half usable since (at the time I was
 querying it) it only displayed maximum 20 results no matter if I set
 results to (20,100 or what)

 It's inconsistent *not* mistaken.

 Your problem report was about a basic configuration issue which would be
 better dealt with in the newsgroup or another forum.  It is not a bug as
 far as I can see. There is significance in the order of VirtualHost
 blocks as per the design and documentation.
 
 If I missed something, could you please clarify exactly what the bug is
 with the simplest possible example, and I will be glad to reopen the bug
 report.
 
 Thanks!

 OK, have a look at the example I have provided in the bugreport and then
 try to explain why when I access
 
 	http://www.sourcepole.ch
 
 I get
 
 	index.xml
 
 instead of
 
 	index.d.xml
 
 Again, interpreted in plain language the configuration file says:
 
 There is a virtual host at 194.6.185.192. It's name is sourcepole.ch. All
 other names that end in sourcepole.ch are also handled by this virtual
 server. When a directory access happens, the index files that the server
 should try to deliver are: index.d.xml first then if not found index.xml
 then index.html.
 
 Mind you, that the config docu states that DirectoryIndex can be used
 *inside* a VirtualHost definition in the same way that it says that
 about ServerAlias. But this is *not* the case. If I access 
 *whatever*.sourcepole.ch then index.d.xml will *not* be served, as it
 *should*.
 
 The other config is a *workaround*, which doesn't change the fact that the
 not-functioning of the first config is IMHO a *bug*.
 
 Thanks for your patience,
 *t

State-Changed-Why:

I have tried and failed to reproduce this problem, so I
still suspect it is a particular quirk of your configuration, like perhaps bad permissions on your
index file or a <Directory> section overriding your
<Virtualhost> config.  However, I will reopen
the report to see if anyone else has any ideas.
