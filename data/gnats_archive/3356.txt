>Description:
Since the Files directive in 1.2 now correctly allows only files and no 
directories (I thought this was useful), can you allow the Directory directive
in .htaccess to compensate for this loss feature/

State-Changed-Why:

It is very unlikely that we will add such a feature.

In my opinion it would be a misfeature, because 
such configuration should be made in the server
configuration files and not in an .htaccess file.

Thanks for using Apache.
