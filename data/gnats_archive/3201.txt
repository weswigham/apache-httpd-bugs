>Description:
Faced with the problem, "How do I setup Apache so that a teacher can give
a class on CGI programming and the students can each have their own areas
for doing CGI programming?"  I read the FAQ and poked around the docs until
I found ScriptAliasMatch.

 I suck.
 
 Not a bug.  Found the error :)
