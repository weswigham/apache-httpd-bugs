>Description:
With
DocumentRoot /web01/blb/html
DirectoryIndex index.html

I receive the following when attempting http://192.168.0.3/
Browser: You don't have permission to access /index.html on this server.

Log File:
[Fri Feb 08 21:07:07 2002] [error] [client 192.168.0.254] (2)No such file or directory: file permissions deny server access: /web0/bl/htm/index.htm

If I set DocumentRoot to /web011/blb/html and attempt the same URL, the log file reports:
[Fri Feb 08 21:55:26 2002] [error] [client 192.168.0.254] File does not exist: /web011/blb/html/

Demonstrating that the DocumentRoot is really wrong, but all other characters are correct.  Notice that the permissions problem isn't even an issue.
>How-To-Repeat:
If I am still on-line.
http://63.180.48.89/

If not, e-mail me and ask.  I'll open up SSH to you so you can review my .conf and error_log.

>Fix:
You give me a breif overview of how the URL is processed and where to look and I will dig through the code and find what I can.

 As close as I can tell in AP_DECLARE(int)
 ap_process_request_internal(request_rec *r) at line 175 of 1715 of
 server/request.c there is a call to ap_run_map_to_storage().  I can't go
 much further, cause it looks internal to a library you sent with the distro
 or something.
 
     if ((access_status = ap_run_map_to_storage(r))) {
         /* This request wasn't in storage (e.g. TRACE) */
         return access_status;
     }
 
 At this point r->filename gets mangled.  Here is a snapshot of what is
 happening right before and after the call.

 If there is more I can do, let me know.

State-Changed-Why:
Dan, believe we had this fixed in 2.0.32, if not in the next
release, 2.0.34.  It was a bug in the directory_walk logic.

Thanks for the detailed report!
