>Description:
In server/mpm_common.c, the subroutine ap_mpm_pod_signal does not close a
socket when it fails to connect to a listener.  Repeated attempts to kill
a listener through the "pipe-of-death" will eventually exhaust the number
of open files allowed by the operating system kernel.  The attached fix
causes the socket which is opened at the beginning of the subroutine to
be closed when it is going to return an error.

This may be masking a lower level error; i.e. I'm not sure why the server
is repeatedly trying to kill a listener (which isn't there) once per second
forever on an "apachectl graceful", but this at least prevents the server
from logging a zillion messages to the system log and filling up partitions
as a result of the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do lots of "apachectl graceful"s.

State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Mon Feb 18 08:21:30 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
the latest beta (2.0.32) has a fix for leaking a descriptor
when the connect failed

current CVS has a fix for a nearly impossible leak when
setting the APR timeout fails

Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache!
