When compiling mod_rewrite (Apache 1.3.6) under Red Hat 6.0 for i386
make complains that it can't find ndbm.h and halts the build process.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
In src/modules/standard/mod_rewrite.h, change
#include <ndbm.h>
to
#include <db1/ndbm.h>

(Sorry, I wish I had time to write a decent preprocessor statement
that'd cover this problem.)
