>Description:
We are using apache and jserv as an oracle database front end for a web-based application.
There are approximately 40 servlets which work in conjunction to produce the correct HTML displays and control
database activities.

The web server and jserv run for extended periods with no problems and then the servlets stop responding.
The web server is still running.  Each servlet logs its transactions and status to log files but there are no problem
indications in those files.  The /usr/local/apache/jserv/logs files give no problem indications either.  The
/usr/local/apache/logs/access_log shows this access in progress when the servlets stopped responding

[15/Dec/1999:22:29:49 -0600] "GET /mdex/DirectorySelectForAdd?. . . . . . (deleted this user's personal info)

By checking a different servlet's logfile which has activity about once a second I was able to see that that
servlet stopped responding at the same time.

The next lines in the access_log shows this line repeated 5 more times at 5 minute 2 seconds intervals.  I'm
guessing this is coming from the web server itself since our user applications do not automatically send retries.

The /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log file does not show an entry with a timestamp at the same time that the
servlets stop responding but there are the following lines between the last entry and when the web server
was restarted:

thr_continue of 0xeabc0740(5367200) failed: 3 = ESRCH.
thr_continue of 0xeabc0748(1124094120) failed: 3 = ESRCH.

thr_continue of 0xeabc06e0(0) failed: 3 = ESRCH.

The servlets did not respond until the problem was discovered about 12 hours later.  The web server was
restarted by "apachectl graceful" and the servlets started working again.
>How-To-Repeat:
This problem occurs randomly as far as we can tell.  We have not been able to cause it to happen.  Since the
web server is being restarted frequently as we make changes to the servlets (the product is still in beta) it is not
clear if it is related to the amount of time or number of transactions since start time.  This has occured about
once a week.  Our application is a 7x24 used by major cell phone carriers and even short outages
are not permitted.
>Fix:
Don't have the slightest, but it has the feel of a breakdown in communications between the web server and jserv
or the jserv gets locked up on an internal error.

You give absolutely no helpful information in your report to

you try to find a solution. My guess is that this 
is an issue in your application (for instance, make 100% sure that you are closing all open database queries properly). 

You might also consider upgrading to the latest versions 
of our software, such as Apache 1.3.9 and Apache JServ 1.1 
from CVS (it is the most stable version).

 Hi Jon,
 
 I'm sorry you aren't able to help us solve this problem.  Maybe you can
 help me resolve it if you can answer the questions below.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike Essex

 Is it true based on your above comment, that a hung JDBC connection can
 cause jserv to stop resonding?

 since it is beta I have not downloaded it.  Usually beta code should not
 be used in high reliability production environments.  Do you feel the
 1.1 beta is more reliable than the 1.0 release version?   Also, when is

 I have absolutely no idea. This is probably an issue internal to Apache (as
 I previously suggested, maybe upgrade to 1.3.9?). It definitely isn't
 something that is produced by Apache JServ itself.

 I have 50,000+ lines of code working just fine.

 It isn't necessarily Apache JServ that is stopped. For example, if your
 database connection pool is using wait()/notify() to hand out Connections,
 then if you give out all of your Connections without freeing any of them, it
 will go into an infinite wait() while waiting for an open connection. In
 that case, then all your servlets will be affected and it will *look* like
 Apache JServ is stopped, but in reality, it is your connection pooling code
 that is holding things up.
 
 This was an issue in our connection pool (which is included in Turbine)
 which we had to fix and was quite difficult to track down properly since it
 involved a case where the connection was not returned properly to the pool
 in a single piece of code.
 
 In other words, Apache JServ doesn't just "stop" unless the JVM crashes. If
 the JVM crashes, that is obviously beyond our control.

 I would use the stuff in CVS, it is currently the most stable version of
 Apache JServ out there.
 
 Since you are in a mission critical application environment, you must have
 development staging servers where you test stuff before making it live. In
 that case, I suggest that you install the latest stuff in CVS on one of
 those servers. If your issues are resolved and no other issues come up, then
 obviously that is your best solution.
 
 As for release schedules, it will be released when it is ready. Current hope
 is before the new year.
 
 thanks,
