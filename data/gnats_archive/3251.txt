>Description:
SSI will not execute. I have tried several different invokes such as <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/rand_tex.pl"-->, <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/rand_tex.pl" -->, <!--#exec cmd="/cgi-bin/rand_tex.pl" -->, <!--#exec cmd="/cgi-bin/rand_tex.pl"-->, etc.
related file config's:

Access.conf

<Directory "c:/apache/htdocs">
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI Includes
AllowOverride None
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory "c:/apache/cgi-bin">
AllowOverride None
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

<Directory "c:/apache/htdocs/panicbutton">
AllowOverride None
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

srm.conf

DocumentRoot "c:/apache/htdocs"

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "c:/apache/cgi-bin/"

AddHandler cgi-script .pl .cgi

AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

The First line of the script

#!/perl/5.00502/bin/MSWin32-x86-object/perl
have also tried
#!/perl/5.00502/bin/MSWin32-x86-object/perl.exe

Please not that full execution works (if I call the script itself in the browser, (http://whkportfolio.dynip.com/cgi-bin/rand_tex.pl), or any other script I feel like calling works fine.  
however, when trying to execute via SSI, it simply doesn't execute. No error messages, no nothing.  When I view the source code for the test page after executing it, it just has the execute command the way it was origionally, not a hint of execution.

Also note that my server is only available from 9:30 AM to 1:00 AM the following morning each day, Mountain Time.



>How-To-Repeat:
the test file I'm using is at http://whkportfolio.dynip.com/panicbutton/test.shtml

I'm using Rand_tex.pl a script by Matt Wright for random text generation, and the script is available for anonymous download at ftp://ftp.whkportfolio.dynip.com/scripts/

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 20 08:56:36 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
You are explicitly disabling SSI support in the directory
you are putting your SSIs in!

See:

<Directory "c:/apache/htdocs/panicbutton">
AllowOverride None
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

That says "only let me execute CGIs, do not let me do SSI,
etc."
