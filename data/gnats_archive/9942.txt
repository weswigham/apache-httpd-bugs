Linux syn.lyximer.net 2.4.17 #1 SMP Thu Jan 10 19:23:29 GMT 2002 i686 unknown
Apache 2.0.33-dev (although happens also with 2.0.32 beta)
PHP 4.2.0-dev (although also happens with 4.1.1)
>Description:
I have AcceptPathInfo On set in the httpd.conf file, in the <Directory> section and also tried in in .htaccess - this seems to have no effect.

I have tried http://server/info.php and the page is displayed normally, the access_log shows;
192.168.1.90 - - [25/Feb/2002:01:32:56 +0000] "GET /info.php HTTP/1.1" 200 36995 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; Q312461)"

With no report in the error log.

Whereas, requesting http://server/info.php/moo (which works fine on apache 1.3.X in the same server!) causes the following to be logged in access_log;
192.168.1.90 - - [25/Feb/2002:01:33:32 +0000] "GET /info.php/moo HTTP/1.1" 404 768 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; Q312461)"

And the following in error_log;
[Mon Feb 25 01:33:32 2002] [error] [client 192.168.1.90] File does not exist: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/info.php/moo

Which looks like apache is ignoring the path info stuff totally and simply reporting a 404, the web page returned is the standard 404 error page.

Versions in use are;
  Apache 2.0.33-dev (although happens also with 2.0.32 beta)
  PHP 4.2.0-dev (although also happens with 4.1.1)

I posted this to the mailing list earlier, and was advised to file a report after checking my settings - i havent, after a few searches, found any other references to it on the bug report database - if there is then I apologise for the duplicate submission.
>How-To-Repeat:
The example urls are on my internal network, although i have duplicated the problem on many servers and environments - it does appear to work fine with .cgi files
>Fix:
No, sorry :(
