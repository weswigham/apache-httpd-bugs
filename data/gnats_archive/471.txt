>Description:
Please,

  what is the configuration to my mime.types to midi files.
  The configuration "audio/x-midi and audio/midi" is wrong, the midi
  files in html haven't been started (with autostart=true) in Netscape 3.01.

  This is a sample in my server: http://www.matrix.com.br/testes/left.html
  The sound hasn't been started.

  This is the same sample in another server: 
      http://gordon.simplenet.com/left.html
  The sound is OK !!!

             Thank You.

State-Changed-Why:
I tried your server and Apache is generating the correct
headers.  So I suspect it's something with the html or with
the browser configuration.

Thanks for using Apache!
