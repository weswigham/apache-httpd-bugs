RedHat Linux 6.2
>Description:
I installed apache using 'SSL_BASE=/usr/local/ssl ./configure 
--prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=ssl
and then make, make install
The installation is successful.
When I run apachectl start, it says 'httpd could not be started'
When I run httpd it says 'Segmentation fault'
The errorlog isn't even created at this point
I am new to Linux and don't know where to look for the core dump if it is there.

I'm afraid we cannot provide support for extensions to
Apache like mod_ssl.
