>Release:        1.3.14
>Organization:
>Environment:
WinNt 4.0 (SP6), Apache 1.3.14
>Description:
When installing Apache 1.3.14 on the server, Adobe Acrobat (have not been able to test with other programs) locks the client when retrieving a pdf-file.

Client: Windows 95/98/NT/2000 etc. + IE 5.x + Adobe Acrobat 4.x
>How-To-Repeat:
Simple install 1.3.14 and put some pdf-files (optimized) on the site. Try to read them on a client.
Install 1.3.12 and everything works!!!
>Fix:
It could be something with Byterange or Byte-serving. But it is just a guess.

State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 31 10:59:54 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Could you please supply details on exactly what headers
the browser is sending, and exactly how the response
of Apache differs between the two version.  You may
need to use a network sniffer to take this off the wire.
Thanks!

State-Changed-Why:
I'm closing this report because it is a duplicate of #6711.
I have been unable to reproduce the problem, so if you can
add to PR#6711 an example URL that exhibits it, and a URL
to the packet traces that Joshua Slive asked for that would
be great. Thanks.
