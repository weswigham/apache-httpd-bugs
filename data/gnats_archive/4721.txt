>Description:
JavaUtils.java line 172 -- the cookie value is url-decoded before a Cookie
is constructed.
This is icorrect since the cookie spec does not *require* cookie values
to be url-encoded, it just recommends it. A lot of older CGI apps do not
encode the cookie values so this breaks interopability.
>How-To-Repeat:
A cookie value of "abc+++def" becomes "abc   def" this breaks things
if the '+' where part of a base64 encoding for example and the cookie
value was not url-encoded first (by another non-servlet app for example).
Sun's Java Web Server does not do this, by the way...
>Fix:
Remove the call to URLDecode() in JavaUtils.java line 172.
Users can always explicitly call URLDecode on the cookie value if
they want.
