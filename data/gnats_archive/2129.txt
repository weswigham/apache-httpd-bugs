>Description:
While trying to set up a combination of name-based and name-and-port-based vhosts,
I got the following warnings, and found the name-based vhost settings were not 
working.

[Thu Apr 23 17:53:13 1998] [warn] VirtualHost www.afx-news.com:80 overlaps with
VirtualHost www.scoops.com:80, the first has precedence, perhaps you need a Name
VirtualHost directive

State-Changed-Why:
Submitter didn't give a valid email address or sample
configs, so we really can't do anything...

Likely a config problem.
