>Description:
From http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_autoindex.html#adddescription:
"File is a file extension, partial filename, wild-card expression or full filename for files to describe."

In the documentation it's not clear to me, how Apache distinguishes between file extensions and partial filenames, but examples e.g. of AddIcon suggest the following example for AddDescription in use with file extensions:

AddDescription "C Header File" .h

While "AddIcon (C,/icons/c.gif) .h" works as it should (it matches "*.h"), the above line does not work like it should: It matches "*.h*" and therefore als matches HTML files and describes them as "C Header File".

'AddDescription "C Header File" h' makes it even worse: It matches every file containing an "h".

Oh, and BTW: 'AddDescription "C Header File" *.h' doesn't work either and also matches the extension prefix "*.h*". :-(

>How-To-Repeat:
Use 

AddDescription "C Header File" .h
AddIcon (C,/icons/c.gif) .h"

and request some directory listing with a bunch of html files. See the descriptions and icons/alt texts.
>Fix:
Maybe partially a documentation bug, too.
