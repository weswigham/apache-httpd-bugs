uname -a: dgux dms1 R4.20MU01 generic AViiON Pentium
>Description:
Named virtual hosts (3 names, 1 IP address) did not work until I gave the
IP address in opposite order (least significant byte first).
In this case:
www.dms.at and dms1.essi.fr have the IP address 157.169.10.160. The
NameVirtualHost and <VirtualHost> did not show an error (httpd -S), but virtual
hosts did not work.
When I added the following directive in httpd.conf:
Listen 157.169.10.160:80
I got the error message:
[Tue Sep 15 14:30:58 1998] [crit] (126)Can't assign requested address: make_sock: could not bind to address 160.10.169.157 port 80
Virtual hosts work since I replaced the IP address with 160.10.169.157.

 What compiler are you using?

 This really looks like a bogosity in the OS.
 
 What does the inet_network man page say WRT the byte order returned?
 
 If you compile and run the following program:
 
 #include <sys/types.h>
 #include <sys/socket.h>
 #include <netinet/in.h>
 #include <arpa/inet.h>
 #include <stdio.h>
 
 int main () {
         printf("inet_network(\"10.11.12.13\") = %ld\n",
                 inet_network("10.11.12.13"));
 }
 
 what do you get?

  All Internet addresses are returned in network order (bytes ordered
  from left to right).  All network numbers and local address parts are
  returned as machine-format integer values.

 The output of this program is:
 inet_network("10.11.12.13") = 168496141
 (which is the same as on my Linux 2.0.35 system).
