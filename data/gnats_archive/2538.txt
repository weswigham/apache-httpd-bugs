>Description:
When I configure a browser to use apache as a proxy server, and then
try to access a nonstandard port on the server, apache incorrectly proxies
me to port 80.
>How-To-Repeat:
set up host foo.mydomain.org as a proxy server on port 80
try to access http://foo.mydomain.org:8080/ through the proxy
this will give you the wrong page (http://foo.mydomain.org:80/)
>Fix:
I suspect that the proxy code ignores the port number of a URL if the host
matches the local hostname. The fix would be to not ignore the port number.

 Please give a sample config.
 
 Are you sure you are specifying the Port directive explicitly in the
 vhost?

 I think you misunderstood my bug report. I am not trying to run apache
 on another port. I am trying to access a *different* server running on
 the same machine as apache. I have apache running on port 80, and my
 custom server running on port 8080. I am trying to get to the url
 http://host:8080 through the proxy, but apache returns me its page
 without ever connecting to port 8080.
 
 My httpd.conf is attached to the end of this message, but I don't
 think it's relevant to this problem.

 # ServerType is either inetd, or standalone.
 
 ServerType standalone
 
 # If you are running from inetd, go to "ServerAdmin".
 
 # Port: The port the standalone listens to. For ports < 1023, you will
 # need httpd to be run as root initially.
 
 Port 80
 
 # HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP numbers
 #   e.g.   www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off)
 # You should probably turn this off unless you are going to actually
 # use the information in your logs, or with a CGI.  Leaving this on
 # can slow down access to your site.

 # If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
 # httpd as root initially and it will switch.  
 
 # User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
 #  On SCO (ODT 3) use User nouser and Group nogroup
 #  On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the
 #  suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.

 # ServerRoot: The directory the server's config, error, and log files

 # mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation,
 # you will save yourself a lot of trouble.

 # contain "*", an IP address, or a fully qualified Internet domain name.

 # ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
 # your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e. use

 # Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you

 #ServerName new.host.name
 
 # CacheNegotiatedDocs: By default, Apache sends Pragma: no-cache with each
 # document that was negotiated on the basis of content. This asks proxy
 # servers not to cache the document. Uncommenting the following line disables
 # this behavior, and proxies will be allowed to cache the documents.
 
 #CacheNegotiatedDocs
 
 # Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out
 
 Timeout 300
 
 # KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
 # one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
 
 KeepAlive On
 
 # MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
 # during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
 # We reccomend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
 
 MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
 
 # KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request
 
 KeepAliveTimeout 15
 
 # Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess how many
 # server processes you need, Apache dynamically adapts to the load it
 # sees --- that is, it tries to maintain enough server processes to
 # handle the current load, plus a few spare servers to handle transient
 # load spikes (e.g., multiple simultaneous requests from a single
 # Netscape browser).
 
 # It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
 # for a request.  If there are fewer than MinSpareServers, it creates
 # a new spare.  If there are more than MaxSpareServers, some of the
 # spares die off.  These values are probably OK for most sites ---
 
 MinSpareServers 8
 MaxSpareServers 20
 
 # Number of servers to start --- should be a reasonable ballpark figure.
 
 StartServers 10
 
 # Limit on total number of servers running, i.e., limit on the number
 # of clients who can simultaneously connect --- if this limit is ever
 # reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.
 # It is intended mainly as a brake to keep a runaway server from taking
 # Unix with it as it spirals down...
 
 MaxClients 150
 
 # MaxRequestsPerChild: the number of requests each child process is
 #  allowed to process before the child dies.
 #  The child will exit so as to avoid problems after prolonged use when
 #  Apache (and maybe the libraries it uses) leak.  On most systems, this
 #  isn't really needed, but a few (such as Solaris) do have notable leaks
 #  in the libraries.
 
 MaxRequestsPerChild 100
 
 # Proxy Server directives. Uncomment the following line to
 # enable the proxy server:

 # To enable the cache as well, edit and uncomment the following lines:

 #CacheGcInterval 4
 #CacheMaxExpire 24
 #CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
 #CacheDefaultExpire 1

 #Listen 3000
 #Listen 12.34.56.78:80
 
 # VirtualHost: Allows the daemon to respond to requests for more than one
 # server address, if your server machine is configured to accept IP packets
 # for multiple addresses. This can be accomplished with the ifconfig 
 # alias flag, or through kernel patches like VIF.
 
 # Any httpd.conf or srm.conf directive may go into a VirtualHost command.
