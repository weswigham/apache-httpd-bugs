>Description:
The problem I'm seeing is the same as PR 2515 -- however, I do not have
"@@SERVER_ROOT@@" anywhere in my config files. My error_log looks like:

[Tue Jun 30 10:18:24 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.0 (Unix) PHP/3.0 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Tue Jun 30 10:18:40 1998] [warn] handler "server-parsed" not found, using default handler for: /opt/gnu/apache/share/htdocs/cdvarn/test.shtml

The 'server-parsed' entry in my config file is:

AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

 I haven't applied any patches to apache. I've built the server with
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache, I've tried './configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
--enable-module=include. I get exactly the same behaviour each time.

Comment-Added:
Do you have an "Options Includes" or "Options +Includes"
directive that covers the scope of the directory where the
file lives? (/opt/gnu/apache/share/htdocs/cdvarn/test.shtml)
Check to see if any <Directory> containers that cover
this directory are failing to propagate or supply the
Includes option.  Note that an "Options foo" completely
supersedes any Options directive previously in effect
for the scope; "Options +foo" or "Options -foo" modifies
the existing Options setting.
