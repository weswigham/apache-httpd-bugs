Linux (Redhat 5.2) - Apache 1.3.6 - 1.3.12
>Description:
Is it possible for Apache not to completely bomb in the event of a missing log file path. Although I understand its reasons for doing what it does, it make for a very NON fault tolerant system. Yesterday for example I move my home directory from one path to another due to space restrictions. I woke up this morning to find to production Apache servers had been down for the last 6 hours because both processed had bombed at the 4am log rotate. I find this unacceptable for a stable system. A user deleting their log directory for example could take down the entire server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply delete any log file directory 
>Fix:
Is there some sort of flag so that Apache only warns about a missing log path rather than completely bombing. I sure I can't be the first person to get annoyed by this feature.

State-Changed-Why:
It is designed this way on purpose.  It is _NOT_ good to have the server
randomly ignoring directives that it can't handle properly at startup.  You
talk as if you have Apache writing logs somewhere that random users have acccess to.
This is a big security nono, and is explicitly warned against in the docs, so we certainly don't support that!
