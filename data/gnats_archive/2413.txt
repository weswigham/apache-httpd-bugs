>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
AIX 4.2.1 GCC 2.7.2.2
>Description:
These two symbols are not exported by httpd but are listed in
src/support/httpd.exp:

ap_spawn_child_err
ap_spawn_child_err_buff

Whereas the following two are missing: 
ap_bspawn_child
ap_spawn_child

Adding these symbols by hand fixed the problem.
This error only affects AIX based machines.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile on AIX, enable shared module support.
>Fix:
rebuild httpd.exp
