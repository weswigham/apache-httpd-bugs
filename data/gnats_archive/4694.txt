>Description:
If the ErrorDocument, say /404.html, references another document relatively, 
say english/error404.htm, then there will be a recursion if a nonexisting 
document is requested from a subdirectory of the DocumentRoot.
This is not exactly a bug but it can crash search engines, Web crawlers, and 
Web browsers.
>How-To-Repeat:
ErrorDocument /404.html references english/error404.htm then nonexisting 
english/test.htm is requested which results in a loop because nonexisting 
document /english/english/error404.htm is requested by mistake. 
>Fix:
For the FAQ: Use absolute paths in ErrorDocument files.
For further development: Set current working directory to path of ErrorDocument.
