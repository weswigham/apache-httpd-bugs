IRIX romulus 6.2 03131015 IP22 mips
Using MIPSPro CC 7.1
>Description:
Compiling the 1.3b5 source without any non-distribution modules, and using either
my own *.conf files or the distribution *.conf files, apache fills up 
error_log with:

[Fri Mar 13 13:07:13 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid: couldn't determine user name from uid

This will continue indefinately until the apache processes are killed.  Apache
1.2.5 works fine in the same directory using the same config files.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
No.  However, while trying to diagnose the problem I ran into problems with
the -X switch -- as far as I can tell, apache is getting as far as accept_mutex_init
(via the SAFE_ACCEPT call in standalone_main) and is exiting after the sem_get
call.

State-Changed-Why:
Please read followups to any posts you make to Usenet regarding
a problem (and please pursue such things before submitting
a bug report) before you send in a bug report.

I will ask again, as I already asked in response to your
Usenet query:

Where are your config files?

Are you sure you have Apache set to use the right config files?
Where are the config files that you think it should be using?
What do you have it compiled to use?

What is the username specified in your config file for the User
directive?  Is there an entry in the passwd file for it?

 apache 1.3 uses sysv semaphores on IRIX ... but maybe there's a tunable
 parameter that needs to be tweaked on your system.  You can probably get a
 quick answer in an irix newsgroup... if you do get the answer please send
 it back to us, thanks!

 It's using the config files in /usr/local/apache/conf.  I have not changed
 the compiled-in defaults.  I have tried it with both the distributed
 *.conf files and with my own with the same results (but you already knew
 thisk, because I told you).

 nobody
 
 (Which follows from the fact that I had the problem with the *.conf files
 distributed with Apache)
 
 >Is there an entry in the passwd file for it?
 
 Yes.  Thank you.  This is what I was looking for.  Removing the duplicate
 user entry (which, incidentally, caused no problems for 1.2.5) fixed this
 problem...and introduced another.
 
 Now, httpd exits immediately with the follow error in the logs:
 
   semget: No space left on device
 
 Which, I suppose, beats an endless loop.

 Hmm, I lied.  It didn't fix the problem.  I rebooted to clear out any
 dangling semaphores, and after the reboot I'm still seeing:
 
 [Fri Mar 13 14:39:59 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid:
 couldn't determine user name from uid
 
 Anything else I can check?

 The following kernel tuneable parameters affect semaphore operation, and
 setting them appropriately can get rid of the 'no space left on device'
 errors from semget.  The values used are in no way tested or optimized;
 they're the result of a cursory search from Alta Vista:
 
   shmmni = 200
 
   semume = 50
   semmns = 200
   semmni = 100
 
 (These go in /var/sysgen/stune)
 
 Unfortunately, this doesn't solve the original problem.  From today's
 logs:
 
 [Wed Mar 25 13:55:58 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid:
 couldn't determine user name from uid
 [Wed Mar 25 13:55:58 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid:
 couldn't determine user name from uid
 [Wed Mar 25 13:55:58 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid:
 couldn't determine user name from uid
 [Wed Mar 25 13:55:58 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid:
 couldn't determine user name from uid
 
 Apache is logging this message as often as 16 times/second.  I would be
 happy to help you solve this, but I'm going to need some assistance from
 you -- I haven't the experience to diagnose this on my own.  For instance:
 
 (1) Where in the code is this being logged *from*?
 (2) Why isn't Apache exiting at this point?  The error appears to be
     non-recoverable.
 (3) How do I get useful debugging output out of Apache?  I've tried
 setting -D_DEBUG and -DDEBUG on the command line, but the only code
 producing any output is main/util.c, and it's not terribly helpful.
 
 Thanks,

 That looks like your User directive is incorrect.

 from each child after it starts.

 The child does exit... but the parent doesn't know why.  I'll see what I
 can do.

 Beyond setting "LogLevel debug" there's not much.

 The latest beta (1.3b7) appears to have fixed this problem.

 For the record:
 
   User nobody
   Group nobody

 (Also for the record:)
