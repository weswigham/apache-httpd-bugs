>Environment:
NT4.0, Apache 1.3b6, isapi, and chilisoft chiliasp.dll
(http://www.chilisoft.com/)
>Description:
I installed the chilisoft (http://www.chilisoft.com) chiliasp.dll by hand into
apache configuration ...

all seems to work, the pages are doled up correctly, but an application error
message appears in a dialog box, as something is trying to read an invalid
memory location.
>How-To-Repeat:
install the chilisoft chiliasp.dll ... this is an active server pages replacement
>Fix:
no, I only have vc++ 4.1, no higher, so I am unable to compile/debug :(

State-Changed-Why:
That's interesting; that's further than I would have thought
you'd get with the chilisoft asp dll.  Without having source
code to their dll or even access to it it's hard to say what's
could possibly be causing that bug.  If you talk the Chilisoft
guys into supporting their product under Apache let us know :)
