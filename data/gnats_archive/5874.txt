>Description:
CustomLog allows a splitting of logs based upon an environment variable
with if/else. This is better than the old one log (per type) only...

But what I'd REALLY like is either:
the ability to assign logs on a Location level base
OR (more robust)
extend the current CustomLog model to support
switch/case-ing.
