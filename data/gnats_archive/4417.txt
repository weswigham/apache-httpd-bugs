>Description:
I recently sent you a message regarding a problem with "www.computer-builders.com" .  I made a slight mistake in describing the results of accessing that website.  I mistook the newsgroup messages for messages in my inbox.  I apologize for that (I am using new email software for the first time at home).  The primary problem still exists, however; that is, the fact that some software has been installed by mistake.  I would still like your assistance in removing the unwanted software.  

Thank you again,
Ethan
