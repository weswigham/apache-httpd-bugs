>Description:
in my configuration file, i had the line AddModule mod_autoindex.c after the line AddModule mod_dir.c, this caused DirectoryIndex to be disregarded.  However, after swapping the lines, this is fine.  Apparently order operations in the AddModule section is necessary, but not documented.

State-Changed-When: Thu Dec 27 20:47:44 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
In the default file;

AddModule mod_autoindex.c
AddModule mod_dir.c

But moreso,

# Note: The order in which modules are loaded is important.  Don't change
# the order below without expert advice.

appears in that section.  It's printed that way for a reason,
and documenting EVERY interaction between modules would be
a herculean effort [one that we would entertain a contribution
of, to the docs@httpd.apache.org list] so this is simply
unrealistic.
