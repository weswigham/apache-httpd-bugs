>Description:
I believe that any path following a CGI script in the URL is passed as arguments
(environment variable PATH_INFO) to the CGI script. However, with Apache 1.3.3
CGI scripts never get invoked if the URL contains %2f instead of /. The
example below would make it clear.
>How-To-Repeat:
The default distribution comes with a printenv cgi-script in cgi-bin directory.
Try the following invocations:
	http://server/cgi-bin/printenv/a/a
	http://server/cgi-bin/printenv/a%2fa
On the second URL, the server would complain that it didn't find the file - the
CGI script never gets invoked
>Fix:
Haven't looked at the code - I guess the place where CGI parsing is done needs
to be fixed.

State-Changed-Why:

This is intentional.  The presumption is that such
encoded slashes are being used as a form of attack, to
access restricted portions of the system that would
automatically be denied if the unencoded slash were
used.  The current version of the CGI spec (under
development at <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/>) says
that the server can impose whatever restrictions it
likes upon PATH_INFO.  It's unclear whether rejecting
the request (as Apache currently does) is preferable to
invoking the script with PATH_INFO reduced to an empty
string.  PATH_TRANSLATED is closely related.

 This doesn't make sense. Whey not unencode the slashes and then check whether
 access is to be allowed - rather than simply rejecting the URL if it contains
 encoded slashes ? I'm trying to configure the Technical Reports server for
 the Department of Computer Science at Rice University. This server interacts
 with the world through a CGI interface and some of the commands that it gets
 have encoded slashes. The sofware is called 'Dienst' and most major
 Universities run it - its available from 
 http://www.ncstrl.org/Dienst/htdocs/Info/about-ncstrl.html.
 
 Is it at least possible to let the rejection of encoded URLs be determined on a
 per-site basis - i.e. through an option in the configuration file of Apache ?

This issue is the same as that described by PR#543.
We'll be using that report to track this.

 Thanks for your earlier reply. I still don't fully understand the concern
 the Apache developers have. Here are my objections for not permitting a 
 %2f in the URL:
 
 1) Before passing the argument to CGI scripts, all arguments are anyway
    unescaped. So any %2f characters would have become a '/' anyway and the
    CGI would be free to discard the arguments upon seeing the '/'. I think
    your concern applies to the case where the %2f is further escaped - i.e.
    into %25%32%66. Unfortunately, Apache still allows this sequence to pass.
    You can try this by:
        http://server/cgi-bin/printenv/a%25%32%66a/
    Look at the PATH_INFO variable returned - it's "/a%2fa/". 
 
 2) I do believe that whether or not to discard the %2f is a policy issue
    and should be left to the CGIs.
 
 
 If my objections seem sound, can you please release a patch for Apache that
 allows a '%2f'. Thanks,
