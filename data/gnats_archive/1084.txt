State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Sep  2 07:51:58 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
It is trying to open a file in the logs directory under
ServerRoot.  If you don't have such a directory, use somethine like:

     LockFile /tmp/accept.lock

to move it to a different directory.  The ommission of
the filename it had trouble opening was accidental and,
as mentioned _numerous_ times in the bugdb has been corrected.

 Hmm?  Do you mean you still have the problem?
 
 Looking further, if you are getting lcok instead of lock then I
 don't think you are using version 1.3a1 as you reported.  Please
 confirm what version of Apache you are using.  Run "httpd -v" to
 get the version number.
 
 In any case, please try 1.2.4.

 Many thank for your helps,
 the backround of my problems was :
 I have destroyed any dynamic links in an update-work from
 linux 2.0.27 to 2.030 and now the httpd from apache is running
 under http://map_1.iae.tu-berlin.de
 To first i have:
 Server version Apache/1.0.0. 
 and i have not found the "lcok" -file over all harddisks
 then i get the apache src from www.apache.com and compiled this.
 (./apache_1.3a1/src/httpd)..
 As i see the same error-message, i think "lcok"-file is "lock"..
 please make this correct in the source-code or binarys...
 (sorry my language is bad)
 by for now hans

 If you are still getting the error about the "lcok" file in 1.3a1,
 then you are not running 1.3a1.  You probably have another binary
 in your path that you are running.  The "lcok" misspelling of lock was
 removed a long time ago, well before 1.2.
 
 Please try 1.2.4.  It is more recent than 1.3a1.  Be sure you are running
 the correct version.
 
 The version you are running may be looking for a /usr/tmp/ or /var/tmp/
 directory; one may be missing.  However, you should upgrade to 1.2.4
 since it has a better error message.
