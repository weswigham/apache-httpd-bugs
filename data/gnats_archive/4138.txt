Solaris 2.5.1 Java 1.1.6b
>Description:
I'm try to get a rather large servlet application running under jserv.  I was able to get the examples and another
simple servlet running no problem.  I'm getting a NoClassDefFound error when I try to run it.
I know i'm getting to the servlet base class for several reasons.  When I remove it, I get a ClassNotFound exception
not the NoClassDefFound Error.  Anyway, I have been through the many jars required 
to run the system many times.  This thing was written to the 1.0 API.  It does run under JRun I'm told.
I was wondering if there is a way to get the thing to print out what class
it's trying to load.  any ideas?  By the way, I really like the way you
guys are headed with jserv.  Everyone I know is goinh the High dollar middleware
route.  I prefer good old servlets.  The zones combined with mod_rewrite and/or mod_java 
will be just what I want.  Thanks
>How-To-Repeat:
No!  It runs inside a firewall against a private database.
>Fix:
No.  If I could just find out what class it's trying to load.
