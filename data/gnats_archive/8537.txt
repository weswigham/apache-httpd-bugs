Linux snark.thyrsus.com 2.4.3-12smp
>Description:
The page contains the string .dbmmanage at the beginning of a
line. This looks like a botched attempt to write ".B dbmmanage"
or something similar.  Troff silently eats this line.

Some .IP tags on the page look like this 

       \fB\fIfilename\fP
in other words, they're unbalanced, which screws up automated
translators.  This should be fixed.
