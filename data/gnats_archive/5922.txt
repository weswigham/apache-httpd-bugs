>Organization:
>Environment:
Running Apache 1.3.12 on Windows 2000 Professional.  ColdFusion 4.01.
>Description:
I am getting the following error when trying to start Apache:  "The procedure entry point _ap_pstrdup@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library ApacheCore.dll".  Apache.exe also reports the line loading the ColdFusion module could not be loaded into the server.  "LoadModule coldfusion_module modules/ApacheModuleColdFusion.dll".  Module is correctly installed in the Modules sub-folder of the Apache directory.  I can't believe this problem is OS-related...will also be trying this on NT 4 Server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache 1.3.12 and ColdFusion 4.0x.  Add the module to the httpd.conf file and attempt to start the Apache server (or run apache directly).
