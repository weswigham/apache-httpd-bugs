>Description:
From userspace with a virtual domain in your home directory:

rm error.log ; touch error.log; chmod 606 error.log

Go to http://whatever/thisurlcausesa404error.html

Apache dumps binary data to error.log for the virt dom to the last size of the
file, then appends data normally.

For example:
shell.one.net (deadlock,7668): touch error.log; chmod 606 error.log
shell.one.net (deadlock,7668): ls -l
total 40
drwxr-xrwx   3 deadlock users        1024 Apr  3 03:11 .
drwxr-xr-x   9 deadlock www          1024 Mar  9 13:26 ..
drwx------   2 deadlock users        1024 Apr  3 02:25 archive
-rw----rw-   1 deadlock users           0 Apr  3 03:11 error.log
-rw----rw-   1 deadlock users       36212 Apr  3 02:19 transfer.log

http://www.jihad.net/thisisa404urlbecauseitisnotontheserver.html

shell.one.net (deadlock,7668): ls -l
total 43
drwxr-xrwx   3 deadlock users        1024 Apr  3 03:11 .
drwxr-xr-x   9 deadlock www          1024 Mar  9 13:26 ..
drwx------   2 deadlock users        1024 Apr  3 02:25 archive
-rw----rw-   1 deadlock users      297526 Apr  3 03:12 error.log
-rw----rw-   1 deadlock users       36212 Apr  3 02:19 transfer.log

Error log is now the size it used to be before being removed.  error.log is
binary data, selecting another 404 URL..

With netscape: http://www.jihad.net/this_is_also_404.html

Cut the binary, what is at the end of error.log:

[Fri Apr  3 03:13:25 1998] File does not exist: /home/d/e/deadlock/web-public/Ji
had//this_is_also_404.html

This is more an annoyance bug than anything else, but could be a hassle if
the site admin is concerns with tracking errors or eliminated error.log for
disk space concerns.

Allow apache to write to log files without needing a hup, or edit source to

 Um, unless you're restarting the server while doing this then you've just
 deleted the error log and nothing else will be written.

 This sounds like there is an external program managing the error.log
 rather than apache.  Are the error logs piped through a program?  Is there
 any cgiwrap or similar pogram involved? 
 
 Is NFS involved?

 It is impossible to do this.

 	That's what should be the case.  As far as I know, httpd was not
 restarted every time I performed this test.  To help answer your question
 below, I cc'd the person who compile apache on w3.one.net.

 	As far as I know, the answer to all of these questions is No.  John?
 
 	The one thing of possible interest is the inclusion of php with
 apache.  The exact environment variable is:
 
 	SERVER_SOFTWARE: Apache/1.2.5 PHP/FI-2.0b12
 
 > Is NFS involved?
 
 	Yes.  The central nfs server contains a raid5 array which allows /home
 to be nfs-mounted on w3.one.net, shell.one.net, and other user servers.
 (httpd runs on w3.one.net, I was logged in on shell.one.net.)  I do not know
 which version of nfsd each machine is running as it has been awhile since
 I administered them.

 	Ok.  Consider the suggestion dead.  ;)

 umm apaches logs are all routed to /dev/null :)
 
 note: cgi can only be executed from within web-public/cgi-bin/ unless
 brent changed it back.

 This is the problem.  NFS doesn't preserve unix filesystem semantics,
 especially regarding append files.  You'll either need to log locally, or
 log via a network socket or something else to the server.  You shouldn't
 be logging in user home directories anyhow, it's a security hazard... at
 least that's what I think you're doing. 
 
 It's better to log into a central location on the webserver, and NFS
 export that.  This is both secure and reliable.  Users just can't rotate
 their logs... I mean sure you could code up something so they could, but
 we're not going to support it, it's far too much of a security problem.

State-Changed-Why:
It is a site-specific configuration problem.  The logs are
being written via NFS, and given that NFS doesn't have unix
file system semantics there's really not much Apache can do.
