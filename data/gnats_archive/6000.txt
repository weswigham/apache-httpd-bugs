>Description:
 Haved now found out that apache actually dumps core after 'chdir ("/") . It dumps core in /.
 Have now run core file through gdb.  And run -t gives this very useful feedback:
 (gdb) run -t
 Starting program: /usr/sbin/httpd -t
 Cannot access memory at address 0x40262874.
 (gdb) 
 
 My question is: is this indicative of physical memory problems?  
 S.O.S
