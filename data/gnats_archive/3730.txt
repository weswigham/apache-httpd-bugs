Linux 2.0.36 #7
gcc version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
We are using a transproxy to pass proxy requests to apache. Apache then passes
the request on to junkbuster 2.0.

The only error messages that were around the time that apache crashes is:
httpd: [Wed Jan 20 15:40:16 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] client denied by server configuration: /home/www_pub

The proxy config section in the httpd.conf
ProxyRequests on
ProxyReceiveBufferSize 2048
CacheRoot /home/cache
CacheSize 50
ProxyRemote * http://localhost:8000
ProxyBlock xxx 
We have lots of ProxyBlock directives for unwanted sites.

The last time apache crashed it had a log entry in the access_log that mixed
asci and non asci charaters.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unkown. There are no specific urls that crashes apache, different urls every day.
Apache crashes during the hours of heavy net use.

State-Changed-Why:
What do you mean by "crashes" Apache.  Please describe
exactly what happens.

Note that a cache size of 50 is somewhat silly; either have
no cache, or have enough to make it worthwhile.

 When the problem occurs apache is no where to be found on the process list.
 When trying to start apache again it says "Unclean shutdown of previous
 Apache run" in the error log. The httpd.pid file is left after apache was
 not running.

 We had a cache size of 500 but for some reason apache filled up all the
 free space on the hard disk of 2.0GB.  Most likely reason is that it used
 up all the free inodes.
