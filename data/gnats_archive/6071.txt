Solaris 7, JDK 1.2.2, Servlet API 2.2
>Description:
The API 2.2 ServletContext specifications state 'There is one context per "web application" per Java Virtual Machine', where web application can be understood as 'zone'.
However, as far as I understand the code of JServ's org.apache.jserv.JServServletManager, a different ServletContext is given to each loaded servlet. This is a major hindrance when trying to use shared memory without a dedicated servlet (which becomes a bottleneck).
