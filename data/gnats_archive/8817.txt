>Environment:
WinNT 4.0 SP6a on an IBM 300GL with PII-450, 256 MB RAM, 30 Gigs HD
Using the Apache 2.0.28 beta .msi installer file
>Description:
Before installing 2.0.28, I uninstalled 1.3.19.  Install went OK and I began moving my files to the new Apache2 directory.  After making some changes to httpd.conf, I tried to start it, but got a Dr. Watson (Access violation at 0x6ee0a832) and this in my error.log:

[Tue Nov 20 13:50:13 2001] [error] (32538)Socket operation on non-socket: setsockopt(SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT) failed.

What little I could find on this error suggested an incorrect ServerType - but in 2.0, this directive has ceased to be!  I did *try* to use a ServerType standalone and inetd, but neither had any effect.
>How-To-Repeat:
If I use the httpd.conf that came default with 2.0, it starts.  If I make just ONE change, uncommenting a LoadModule line, I get the crash and error.
>Fix:
Nothing I tried made a difference - Registry hunt, ServerType, reboots...

State-Changed-Why:
Sounds like you were trying to load 1.3 modules into a 2.0
server; no can do.
