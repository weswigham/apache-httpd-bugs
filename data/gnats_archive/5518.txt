FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE i386, gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
The httpd dies without any output to its error log, stdout or stderr, even with LogLevel set to "debug". This matches PR #5258 with the addition that it does not affect only symlinked directories (I also agree with the poster of #5258 in that it costs dearly in troubleshooting time - maybe it belongs on the known bugs list). The problem was traced to a
bad pathname in a VirtualHost block:
ErrorLog /usr/home/coleclinics/error_log
TransferLog /usr/home/colesclinics/access_log
...where ~colesclinics is a mistyped path.
This behaviour repeated itself with the TransferLog and ErrorLog lines reversed,
however it only happened when the TransferLog entry was bad. With the ErrorLog
containing a bad path, it was logged properly. The problem was finally identified using truss(1). I was able to reproduce the error (well, lack thereof :) on Apache 1.3.6/PHP3 under BSDI 3.0.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure a VirtualHost with a bad pathname in the TransferLog and try to start httpd.
>Fix:
Sorry, no.

 Addendum:
 
 As I subsequently found out, the errors ARE logged. They get logged to the
 ErrorLog file of the VirtualHost with the bad TransferLog entry, which
 really doesn't help at all when you have 200 unique users/sites on the
 machine. It only appears in logs/error_log if there is no ErrorLog
 directive for the affected VirtualHost.
