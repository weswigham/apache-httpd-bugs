>Description:
Creating rules with map-files doesn't seem to be able to handle $1 has keyword.
If I try to use a keyword that I know exist in the mapfile as argument, it works, but if I try to use $1 that I shall get from the rule, it doesn't.

mod_proxy and mod_rewrite is enabled.

LOG_OUTPUT:
map lookup FAILED: map=map_users1[txt] key=$1
>How-To-Repeat:
map_users1:
user1  server1

httpd.conf:
 RewriteEngine on
 RewriteMap map_users1 txt:/path/to/map_users1
 RewriteRule ^/~([a-z])(.*) http://${map_users1:$1}/~$1$2
