SunOS 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW, Ultra-250
gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I've only modified the httpd.conf and .htaccess files. In .htaccess, no matter
what settings I give the Limit directive a snoop trace between my client and
appache server produces:
PUT /users/br/roaming/WRITETEST HTTP/1.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.61 [en]
Pragma: no-cache
Host: radmin.rad.wfubmc.edu
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1,*,utf-8
Content-Length: 1
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Date: Thu, 29 Jul 1999 17:04:47 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.6 (Unix)
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE
Connection: close
>How-To-Repeat:
I hope you can reproduce it. A key part of this seems to be Netscape Communicator.
I want to be able to use their "roaming profiles" feature to GET and PUT users
profiles on/from a web server. I've seen problems with Communicator in the past,
publishing html using http instead of ftp never has worked in Communicator. I've
created a folder off docroot, created a htpasswd file, created .htaccess in the
folder off docroot I want profiles to store in, and opened up perms on the folder.
>Fix:
I am out of ideas. This mail is the last act of a desparate man.

State-Changed-Why:
PUT is not one of the methods Apache supports by default.
You need to set up a script to handle it, and enable it
with the Script directive (see the mod_actions
documentation).
