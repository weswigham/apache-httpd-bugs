>Description:
For various reasons we have defined mechanisms for almost every field in
request_rec to be merged or passed down into subrequests, or promoted from
a subrequest into the parent request.  There is one very notable exception,
request_config.  This field (not used at all by stock modules) contains
arbitrary binary data, and the API does not define any semantics for
merging/promoting it.  Modules would have an extremely hard time using
this field because subrequests are ubiquitous.

A similar comment could be made about r->notes.  But that is just a table
and is easy to define merging semantics without api additions.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I tend to lean towards removing request_config.  Unless someone can demonstrate
a use for it ... in which case we could define some merging functions in the
api

Comment-Added:
I actually found a use for request_config... a use which relies on
it not merging across subrequests.  See mod_mmap_static.

But in order to use it I still have to double-check that the
value I tucked into request_config is still useful later on
when I need it again.  i.e. request_config is still bogus, 
and is only useful for saving a binary search in this case.
