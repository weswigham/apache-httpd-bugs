>Description:
In a module, if you want to use friendly threads, 
and you want config data by thread using array, you can write functions as:

/* public function returning the number of threads in the process */
int threads_number() {
	extern int threads_per_child;
    return threads_per_child;
}

/* public function returning an offset [0 to ThreadsPerChild-1] or -1 on error */
int thread_offset () {
    int i;
	extern HANDLE* child_handles;
    HANDLE thread_handle = GetCurrentThread();
    for ( i=threads_number()-1 ; i>=0 ; i-- )
	if( thread_handle == child_handles[i] )
	    return i;
    return -1;
}

but the problem is:
child_handles is in the worker_main function stack.

Merci.

>Fix:
Don't put child_handles in the worker_main function stack.

 It looks to me like you're trying to re-implement thread specific data,
 functionality provided by the C compiler and operating system already.  Or
 maybe I'm confused about what you're trying to do.
 
 If you note a global declaration with APACHE_TLS then it will have a copy
 specific to each thread.
