Apache is exiting!



>How-To-Repeat:
Run httpd, under Digital UNIX.
>Fix:
It seems that the initgroups call in http_main.c is comparing the wrong return value under Digital UNIX.

From the initgroups() man page:
RETURN VALUES

  Upon successful completion, the initgroups() function returns 0 (zero). If
  the initgroups() function fails, 1 is returned and errno is set to indicate
  the error.

From the http_main.c source:
  if (initgroups(name, ap_group_id) == -1) {
            ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ALERT, server_conf,
                        "initgroups: unable to set groups for User %s "
                        "and Group %u", name, (unsigned)ap_group_id);
            clean_child_exit(APEXIT_CHILDFATAL);
        }

For Digital UNIX, it should be == 1.

I applied this fix, and the server appears to work. Without this fix, the server would exit, with error, immediatly.

 That is bastard.
 
 Are you _sure_ that isn't a -1?

 Erm... that makes no sense.
 
 If it returns 0 on success, and it is succeeding, then the error will not
 be logged because 0 != -1.  So obviously it can't be returning 0 on
 success.  Are you sure you didn't change anything else when you
 recompiled?

 	This problem still exists under Digital UNIX 4.0
 
 	The initgroups() that is part of DU returns 1 on error, rather
 than the -1 as expected in the source (http_main.c).
 
 	The initgroups() included with the source isn't sufficient, since
 the initgroups() that is part of DU uses SIA calls (similar to
 Linux/Solaris PAM).
 
 	Perhaps an if( initgroups( name, ap_group_id ) != 0 ) would be
 more appropriate than the "if( initgroups( name, ap_group_id ) == -1 )"
 already present in src/main/http_main.c.

State-Changed-Why:

This report is mistaken.  Changing the value just prevents
the error from being caught.  You should instead find
out why initgroups is failing and fix that problem, rather
than the symptom.

The man page is simply in error.  If the function wasn't
returning -1, then Apache would not have exited.
