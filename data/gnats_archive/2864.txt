State-Changed-Why:
Erm... how do you expect us to do anything if you don't
say what you mean by "doesn't work"?  Did you enable the appropriate
setup in your config file?  What do you get when you try?
Do you get errors compiling?  What is in the error log?

 I enable the appropriate setup (see bug report ...):
 
  OPTIM="-O2" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
                          --enable-rule=STATUS \
                          --enable-modules=most \
                          --enable-shared=max \
                          --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a \
                          --enable-shared=php3
  gmake
  gmake install
 
 but "http://localhost/server-status" return
 
  ...
 
  To obtain a full report with current status information and DNS and LOGGING
  status codes you need to recompile Apache after adding
  the line 
 
  Rule STATUS=yes
 
  into the file Configuration
 
 ... but "Rule STATUS=yes" IS in Configuration ...8( !
  
 I also added "-DSTATUS" by hand, but only BASIC, not FULL, server status
 worked.
 
 Bye !
