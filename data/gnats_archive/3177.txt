Linux 1.2.13

libc.so.5.0.9
>Description:
On this system the following error is produced:
http_core.c: In function `set_rlimit':
http_core.c:2029: `rlim_t' undeclared (first use this function)
http_core.c:2029: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
http_core.c:2029: for each function it appears in.)
http_core.c:2029: parse error before `cur'
http_core.c:2043: `cur' undeclared (first use this function)
http_core.c:2056: `max' undeclared (first use this function)
make[1]: *** [http_core.o] Error 1

Using the suggestion in http_core.c line 46

/* If your platform doesn't define rlim_t then typedef it in ap_config.h */

results in multiple definition errors in other modules that recursively include
the ap_config.h file.



make: *** [subdirs] Error 1
>How-To-Repeat:
Unless you can duplicate the conditions on this system, no.

you might try to typedef rlim_t and see if the results are the same on 
a more recent system.
>Fix:
The simple solution was to put the typedef directly in the http_core.c file.

I suggest a change to ./Configure to properly handle this.

State-Changed-Why:
To me, this looks like it should work. This code which is in ap_config.h
should handle your situation:

/* glibc 2.1 and later finally define rlim_t */
#if !defined(__GLIBC__) || __GLIBC__ < 2 || (__GLIBC__ == 2 && __GLIBC_MINOR__ < 1)
typedef int rlim_t;
#endif

I don't understand why it isn't. Is __GLIBC__ defined somewhere?
Try 

gcc -E ap_config.h

and see if the typedef shows up in the output.

 Yes, this is a problem. You should have an os.h in src/os/unix
 and the includes during compiles should reference it. Try again with a
 completely clean 1.3.3 and see if the problem shows up again. If so,
 could you also paste in the compile command used for http_core.c, and
 tell us exactly how you ran the configuration step?

 But what is the specific command used to compile http_core.c that you
 see on the screen?
 
 Something like:
 
 gcc -a -b -c -I../os/unix -blah -blah http_core.c

 Didn't you say at the top that this fails on 2.0.3x as well?

 Maybe. I don't have any systems running 1.x, so I can't diagnose this.

 I'm guessing some mixup in your include files actually. I believe that
 rlim_t is defined in the header files for libc, not the kernel, and
 Apache will typedef rlim_t if your libc is before glibc 2.1.

 Sorry here it is...
 
 gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DLINUX=1 -DUSE_HSREGEX  
 http_core.c 
 
 http_core.c: In function `set_rlimit': 
 http_core.c:2029:`rlim_t' undeclared (first use this function)

 I've been working with the submitter offline on this problem, but to
 summarize: I think the problem is that the #ifdef block that contains
 the typedef for rlim_t in ap_config.h is contained in an #ifdef block
 limiting it to kernels >= 2.0. Here's a potential patch for this:
 please try it and report on whether it works. I was able to compile
 successfully on a 1.x system with this patch.
