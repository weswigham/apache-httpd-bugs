>Description:
This is a modification to mod_proxy.c which makes a powerful substitution available.

The default configuration file is /etc/proxy_substitute.conf
If it is not found, no substitution takes place and apache works like if these changes weren't there.
The syntax in the configuration file is the following

substitute
http://one.site.com/this/should/be/replaced.html
http://another.site.com/this/should/also/be/replaced.html
with
http://the.new.site.com/this/is/the/destination.html

This means two documents will be replaced with one page.
But there is also a "*" at the end of an URL allowed:

substitute
http://advertising.site.com/spamconsoles/*
with
http://my.site.com/directory/closespamconsole.html

This will replace everything in the directory /spamconsoles of 
the host advertising.site.com with the given document on my.site.com.
So many documents in a tree are replaced with one document.
This is really useful for surfing on some sites who use popup-consoles for advertising-
purposes. You can now replace the locations of the popup-consoles with a local document on 
your apache web-server which just closes these windows. This saves some bandwith
because the advertising documents (which you most likely dont want) are not loaded 
from the internet and you don't need to close all these windows manually.


The "*" is even allowed in the destination path:

substitute
www.my.site.com/apache-mirror/*
with
http://www.apache.org/*

This would mirror the complete apache-website into the "/apache-mirror"-directory 
on www.my.site.com
So if you request www.my.site.com/apache-mirror/directory/apage.html
you would get the page from http://www.apache.org/directory/apage.html
>How-To-Repeat:
#example configuration for closing spam consoles... (replace with your own config)
substitute
http://members.tripod.com/adm/popup/*
http://www.geocities.com/ad_container/*
http://home.talkcity.com/homepopup.html*
with
http://my.apache.server.com/close_spam_console.html
end
