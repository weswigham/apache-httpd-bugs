Attempt to include into httpd.conf file d:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\jserv\conf\jserv.conf

[Wed Oct 25 16:35:08 2000] [error] Access to config file d:/program files/apache group/apache/d:\Pro
gram Files\Apache Group\Apache\jserv\conf\jserv.conf denied: not a valid filename

State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Mon Oct 30 07:38:08 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:
This is an identified bug... please assure that you do not use
backslashes in your LoadModule directive in httpd.conf, in other
words, this line is invalid:
LoadModule c:\apache\modules\mod_foo.dll

while this line will work as advertised:
LoadModule c:/apache/modules/mod_foo.dll

This issue affects the Include directive, as well.
