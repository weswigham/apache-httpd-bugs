HP-UX 9.04, ANSI cc
>Description:
Compiler message:
        cc -Ae -c   +O3 +DA1.1 +DS1.1 -DHPUX -DSTATUS   mod_rewrite.c
cc: "mod_rewrite.c", line 2972: warning 562: Redeclaration of "add_env_variable"
 with a different storage class: "add_env_variable" will have static storage 
 duration.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Definition/declaration of add_env_variable is inconsistent:
 mod_rewrite.c:void add_env_variable(request_rec *r, char *s)
 mod_rewrite.h:static void   add_env_variable(request_rec *r, char *s);
Since is is not used outside mod_rewrite.c, it should probably
become a static
