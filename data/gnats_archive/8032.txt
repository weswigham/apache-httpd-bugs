>Description:
When i try to set for example a responce from a CGI to 301 Moved permanently,
i get an Internal Server Error.

It seems that Apache won't allow the CGI script to set the HTTP/1.x responce
header, it only allows it to start with the usual Content-type header.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a cgi script which outputs:

HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently
Content-type: text/html
Location: http://www.apache.org

<html><body>Moved to http://www.apache.org</body></html>

This output should actually redirect your browser to http://www.apache.org,
but it won't do it with Apache, it works fine with other web servers.
>Fix:
Apache should check if the first thing the CGI writes to STDOUT is an
HTTP header, and replace its own with the one the CGI gave us.

State-Changed-Why:
CGI headers and HTTP headers are _DIFFERENT_.  Please read the CGI spec or a document on how CGI headers work for details.  To summarize: to change the status code, you need to use a Status: CGI header, which the web server will then put in the appropriate HTTP header.
