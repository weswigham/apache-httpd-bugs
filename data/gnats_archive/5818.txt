Windows NT 4.0  (SP5)
MS Visual C++ 5.0
>Description:
Apache does not start. Even the original unchanged Apache distribution failed to work.
Following message appears in the error log:

[crit] (10091)(FormatMessage failed with code 317): setup_inherited_listeners: WSASocket failed to open the inherited socket.

However, it runs in single-process mode (switch -X), because there is no additional client process spawned.

This problem also appeared with Apache 1.3.9.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache 1.3.11 (or 1.3.9) and run it as console application or service.
>Fix:
There may be a problem in piping the socket information to the client process.

State-Changed-Why:

This is very likely interference from another application,
such as Avtail Connect or a firewall produce such as 
BlackIce.  Assure no other program is interfering with the
port (you may have to set up an exclusion list in such a
program), and read the detailed notes that will arive in
the upcoming FAQ for version 1.3.13.
