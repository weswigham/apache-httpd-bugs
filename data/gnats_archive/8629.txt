I would have to think it is a httpd.conf file problem.  Where I haven't specified something I should have....  maybe you can take a quick look at it and let me know.  I can send you my conf file if you like.....

This is a worm designed to attack IIS machines.  It is

 this worm.... does it have a name and can it be protected against??  I would
 really like to not see those messages and they appear both in Windows and
 Linux installations of Apache 1.3.22.
 
 thanks,
 Michael

 There is no need to protect against it.  It is completely harmless to
 Apache.
 
 As I mentioned, if you want to discuss this further, you should use an
 appropriate forum.  For example:
