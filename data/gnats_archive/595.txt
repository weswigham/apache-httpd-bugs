>Description:
I'm not sure if it's a documentation bug or actually a bug in Apache. The problem is
that mod_auth_db* only works if mod_auth is compiled in but the docs doesn't
mention this. mod_auth's page is clear: "it provides for user authentication
using textual files". It seems that if one wants to do user authentication
using only db files, to chop off mod_auth from Configuration is a harmless
thing to do. It isn't. When user authentication takes place, the authenticated
user gets a 500 Server Error and Apache logs the (somewhat crypt) "couldn't
check group. No groups files?" message in error_log.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache with mod_auth_db but without mod_auth and try to do some
authentication.
>Fix:
Nope, if it's a Apache bug. I don't know very much about Apache internals...

Correct mod_auth.html if it's just a documentation mistake.

State-Changed-Why:
The FAQ now talks about this problem.  Unless you specify a group
file with your auth module, when apache tries to do a group lookup
it will fail with that error.  You should be able to set the
appropriate AuthDBxxAuthoritative directive and get rid of this
error.

Thanks for using Apache!
