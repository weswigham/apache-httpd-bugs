Subject: The "Order" directive does not recognize whitespace in a config file.

>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 running source compiled on Solaris 2.5.1 with GCC 2.8.1.
>Description:
Inside a <Directory> directive, this does not work (crashes the server with an
appropriate error):

  Order Deny, Allow

Simply eliminating the space fixes the problem:

  Order Deny,Allow
>How-To-Repeat:
<Directory "/path/to/my/htdocs">
  AllowOverride None
  Order Deny, Allow
  Deny from All
  Allow from mydomain.com
</Directory>

  
>Fix:
Simple matters of contiguous whitespace (on a single line) should not confuse
the config file parser.

State-Changed-Why:

That's correct, whitespace is not allowed between the
keywords.  The documentation has been updated to make
this clear, and the change will appear in the next release.
Thanks for using Apache!
