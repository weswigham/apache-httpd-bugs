>Description:
A proprietary program (someone else's) calls mine. I respond with a MIME header and a 13 byte ASCII sequence.
Content-type: text/plain\n\n
Something: \nxx\n

This works perfectly until the CONTENT_LENGTH exceeds 480 bytes. 
All looks good on my end. I have removed all but the two printf statements while testing.

My log shows 200 13 for all GET and POST working and not.

Trying to find out if anyone can suggest to me where to look. 
It appears that maybe Apache does not receive the HTTP/1.0 from 
the client and is sending a simple response and suppressing the 
Content-type header.

This may not be an Apache bug, but there is a chance that it is.
Any suggestions welcome.
>How-To-Repeat:
I can't repeat it myself. A proprietary program is the caller.

 Please upgrade to 1.2.6 and try again.

State-Changed-Why:
As mentioned in private mail, this isn't reproduceable...
for example, the form used for the apache bugdb uses POST and
we have folks send us more than 480 bytes of data all the
time.  So you'll need to provide more info unfortunately.

Is the client an HTTP/1.1 client?
