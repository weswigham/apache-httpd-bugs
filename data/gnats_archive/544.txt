>Environment:
We are using UnixWare 2.1.1 with most, if not all, of the PTFs installed, including ptf3123b (socket) patches.  On an AMI MP motherboard with two CPU's and the Intel Pro 100B adapter using drive d100-U20MP on a 10Mbit LAN.
>Description:

After the first connection to the web site (we also run 5 virtuals with unique IPs on the same interface) the browser will not get any response from the server.

The error log contains line that state the getsockname failed, broken pipe.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile the daemon on Unxware 2.1.1 and run it.
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
No response, assuming serializing fixes it.  If not, then try
1.2 release, and take a look at the unixware specific documentation
underneath htdocs.
