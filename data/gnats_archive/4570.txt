 Still does it on Apache 1.3.14
 
 The main server has "HostnameLookups On" and
 "HostNameLookups off" in the virtual host.

 This can happen if you have any access controls based on the remote
 domain name.

 There are various .htaccess files on the domain,
 however the most involved they get are :
 
 
 <Limit GET POST>
 order deny,allow
 deny from none
 allow from all
 </Limit>
 
 <Limit GET POST>
 require valid-user
 </Limit>
 
 And its not like EVERY hit in a log shows the domain
 name.  Some will show the IP, sometimes domain, FOR
 THE SAME DIRECTORY.

TaDum.... You found your problem.  If you look through
the official Apache documentation, you will find there
is no such keyword as "none" in the Allow/Deny statements.
Therefore, Apache is doing reverse lookups in an attempt
to find a hostname "none".

The presence of this, and the unnecessary and possibly
dangerous <limit GET POST> lines, indicates that you
are using a very bad set of documentation.  I suggest
you inform whoever wrote the docs that you are using
that they should consult the official Apache docs
to find their mistakes.

Thanks for using Apache!
