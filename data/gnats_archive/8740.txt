>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 and all other platform supported by Apache
>Description:
THE PROBLEM IS THAT APACHE SUCKS,  APACHE IS OPEN-SOURCE, SO ALREADY IT'S NOT GOOD SINCE IT HAS NO BUSINESS MODEL BECAUSE IT'S FREE.

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, AND YOU DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING FOR APACHE, SO U GET NOTHING.

APACHE IS STILL BASED ON ARCHAICH TECHNOLOGIES LIKE PERL AND CGI.

WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO UNDERSTAND THAT NO ONE WANTS TO KEEP SUPPORTING PERL OR CGI.  YOU NEED TO WRITE APACHE IN C# IN THE .NET PLATFORM.
>How-To-Repeat:
YOU CAN REPEAT IT BY MAKING ANOTHER VERSION OF APACHE BASED ON PERL AND CGI AND MAINTAIN IT'S OPEN SOURCE
>Fix:
YES, DO NOT MAKE IT OPEN-SOURCE, CODE APACHE IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT ARCHAIC, AND THERE U GO.

OTHERWISE, USE IIS OR SOMETHING ELSE.

Thank you for your comments.  We already have a secret version that does everything you talk about, plus MAKES MONEY FAST, however since it is not open source, it isn't available to you.
