Solaris (SPARC) 2.5.1, gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Contrary to the mod_include documentation, the XBitHack cannot be set in
an .htaccess file (error log: "XBitHack not allowed here"). On the other
hand, it can be set in a <Location> ... </Location> section, which is not
mentioned in the documentation. (This even allows to set XBitHack for a
single file.)
