I'm using PHP3.
Under Linux this work perfectly, but under Windows NT not.

An example from PHP :

    <?
        if(!$PHP_AUTH_USER) {
            Header("WWW-authenticate: basic realm=\"My Realm\"");
            Header("HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized");
                        echo "Text to send if user hits Cancel button\n"
            exit;
        } else {
            echo "Hello $PHP_AUTH_USER.<P>";
            echo "You entered $PHP_AUTH_PW as your password.<P>";
        }
    ?>

Using Linux server:
  Netscape prompt me for user and password as should.

Using NT server:
  Netscape don't prompt me but view this error message:

!Internal Server Error
!
!The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
!
!Please contact the server administrator, you@your.address and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might
!have done that may have caused the error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Always
>Fix:
On Linux it works OK.

State-Changed-Why:
First: WinNT 3.51 is not officially supported, only NT4.  
That it works is kinda cool, but I don't think we're 
equipped to debug much for that platform.  So my first
suggestion would be to upgrade to NT4.

Secondly, what does your error_log say was the cause of
the error?

 Hallo Brian.
 I tested Apache under NT 4 , but i have the same problem as in 
 NT 3.51. I hope that new release for windows will be working
 under NT 3.51 too, because NT 4 is too slow and shity.
 
 This is my error_log:
 1) if .htaccess doesn't exists and in access.conf is
      .htaccess AllowOverride None 
 
  [error] malformed header from script. Bad 
  header=HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized: e:/apache/cgi-bin/php.exe 
 
 2) if .htaccess exists and in access.conf is
      .htaccess AllowOverride  AuthConfig
 
  [alert] e:/apache/htdocs/.htaccess: Invalid command 'user:password', 
  perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the 
  server configuration 
 
 Majco.

 Sorry.
 This is not bug, this is my stupidity.
 Please delete this report.
 
 By the way i can get dialog for user and pasword with
 this PHP script:
 <?
       Header("WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=USER");
       Header("Status: 401 Unauthorized");
 ?>
 This script is other becuase this PHP is not apache module but cgi.
 
 But why apache not send user and password by HTTP variables in cgi?
 I need user and password only for DB authentication.I require
 HTTP_USER any time and HTTP_PASSWD in status 401 no matter
 if .htacces exists or not.
 
 Majco.
