I'm sorry, I can't find where NGROUPS is referenced in 
suexec at all.  Exactly where is it?  What problem
are you having building suexec?

 I can't find NGROUPS in suexec.c.  Please point out exactly where you are
 seeing it and the exact errors you are getting when you try to compile.

 I must humbly beg apology - the version that was having build problems had
 been patched with the suexec/fastcgi updates, which was what introduced
 NGROUPS.  Please excuse the interruption....  I will forward the bug
 report onto the fastcgi maintainers.
