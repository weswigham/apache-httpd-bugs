>Release:        1.3.9
>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0, Apache version 1.3.9 only (not in 1.3.6)
>Description:
By doing a detached process, a new error has appeared under Windows NT (may be under other Win32 platforms, but havn't checked). For example, a perl process that runs another process will NOT be able to capture that other process's output.
 
The server actually opens a new console window with the output on the server (the window disappears almost immediately). This is not the way previous version worked, nor the way UNIX versions worked.

-- Eero
>How-To-Repeat:
Example:
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
$xxx = `ls`;
print "Line 1\n$xxx\nLine 2";

will produce:
Line 1
Line 2

The ls command (or 'dir' if you prefer) will be completely ignored. It will not produce a Server Error (500), nor will the server die, it just doesn't quite work.
>Fix:
Undo the DETACHED process "fix," or fix the fix.
