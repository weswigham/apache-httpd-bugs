>Description:
in httpd.h restart_time is missing an extern declaration.  It's only user,
mod_status, gets a private uninitialized copy.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Load mod_status via mod_dll, fetch the status page and notice that the
start time reported is unix time zero.  Then notice that httpd.h doesn't
have an extern on the decl. of restart_time.
>Fix:
Fixing this exposes a design
flaw in MODULE_VAR_EXPORT.  mod_status wants MODULE_VAR_EXPORT to be do a
dllimport, when it loads httpd.h, but it wants it to do dllexport when it
defines it's module variable

State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Wed Sep 24 21:58:57 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
In the current development source it is declared as

extern API_VAR_EXPORT time_t restart_time;

and API_VAR_EXPORT is declared:

#ifdef IS_MODULE
# define API_VAR_EXPORT         __declspec(dllimport)
#else
# define API_VAR_EXPORT         __declspec(dllexport)
#endif

Which should solve it ...
