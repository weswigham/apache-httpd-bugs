>Description:
This is NOT a bug report - just a suggestion of a new feature! I KNOW that i'm sending this to the wrong place, but there was no other "contact us" link, os what should i do?!?

Anyway, here goes: How about making Apache servers ignore case when processing a HTTP-request? It would be much better, so you wouldn't have problems with uppercase/lowercase in URLs. And since there anyway can't be two identical filenames just with different case, there is actually no good reason not to make it case-insensitive!

State-Changed-Why:
Apache should not and will not ignore case in HTTP requests.  As
defined by the appropriate standards, they are case sensitive.
If you wish to use mod_speling, it can try to guess at what the user
wants.  You most certainly can have two files with differing cases!
