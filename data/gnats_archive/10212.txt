>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Apache 2.0.32 (beta) running on Windows 2000 with SP2. Binaries were downloaded from official location, not compiled.
>Description:
Using the "Dav On" directive in folders that are not in the same drive (C:, D:, ...) as DocumentRoot does not activate mod_dav extensions in them. Mod_dav works correctly if enabled in folders under that drive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using the following configuration:

DocumentRoot "D:/Apache2/htdocs"
<Directory "D:/Apache2/htdocs">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory "D:/Apache2/htdocs/dav1">
   Dav On
</Directory>

Alias "/dav2" "D:/Temp"
<Directory "D:/Temp">
    Dav On
    Options Indexes MultiViews
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

Alias "/dav3" "F:/Dav"
<Directory "F:/Dav">
    Dav On
    Options Indexes MultiViews
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

Dav1 and dav2 can be used as Web Folders with Windows. Dav3 cannot, Windows Explorer complains that "the folder you entered does not appear to be valid". All of them can be accessed normally using a web browser, and directory indexes are presented as expected.
