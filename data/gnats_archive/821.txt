>Environment:
IBM AIX ipo 1 4 003C83064C00
>Description:
When I browse the virtual name, it will return the directory listing instead 
of the actual web page. When I click on the file index.html, it reports that 
the file not found. For other html files, it can display without problem. I 
have tried many adjustment in httpd.conf file and use different ports, but 
all won't work. I have searched thru all FAQ and Apache resources without any 
solution. I've also read from the newsgroups that a number of other webadm 
using Apache also have the same problem but none get any respond on a fix.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Try http://www.amcallpaging.com:8080.

Port 8080 is a must as we are still running a NCSA httpd under Port 80 before 
we can use Apache without any virtual host problem.
>Fix:
No, and no one in the related newsgroups seems have any solution

 Hi Ken,
 
 I have just sent the three configratuation files (httpd.conf, access.conf
 and srm.conf) for your inspection. Just a note ...in the httpd.conf
 section, we have just use the first virtual host (amcallpaging) for the
 test. The remaining virtual hosts may not have the correct config yet. If
 you are doing testing, please use the first one. 
 
 Thanks and regards,
 Bosco.

State-Changed-Why:
Please verify that this is still happening with Apache 1.2.4
and/or 1.3b2.  (If you use the latter, you'll need to
add the following line at the top of your config files:

    NameVirtualHost n.n.n.n

for each IP address that has multiple name-vhosts on it.)
