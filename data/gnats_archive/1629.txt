>Description:
Would you please quote $(CC) in recursive calls to Make?
src/Makefile.tmpl:
        (cd regex; $(MAKE) lib CC='$(CC)' AUX_CFLAGS='$(CFLAGS)' RANLIB='$(RANLI
B)')
        $(MAKE) CC='$(CC)' AUX_CFLAGS='$(CFLAGS)' RANLIB='$(RANLIB)')
src/Modules/Makefile:
        (cd $@; $(MAKE) CC='$(CC)' AUX_CFLAGS='$(MOD_CFLAGS)' RANLIB='$(RANLIB)'
)
>How-To-Repeat:
Set something like:
CC=gcc -V2.7.2.3 -b i586-unknown-linux-gnulibc1 -nostdinc
in Configuration; ./Configure; make
>Fix:
Please put single quotes around $(CC) in all recursive Make calls.
I can email a patch if the above is not clear
