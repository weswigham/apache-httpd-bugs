>Description:
Using the automagical configure in the top level directory of Apache 1.3.0 is 
redefining STATUS defined under /usr/include/arpa/nameser.h.

The Apache configure creates the file ~/src/include/ap_config.h and makes the 
entry:

#ifndef STATUS
#define STATUS
#endif

Where /usr/include/arpa/nameser.h defines this as:

#define STATUS  0x2  /* nameserver status query */

This happens on both Solaris 2.6 and Solaris x86 2.6.


I noticed this when compiling PHP 3.0 w/the Apache code ( generated compile 
warning ). 

I just fixed it by hand and seems to be OK.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the top level configure in the apache distribution.

configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a

State-Changed-When: Sat Sep 19 20:29:16 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
In the next release of Apache, the STATUS define will be
replaced by a configuration directive (ExtendedStatus), so
your problem should go away.

Thanks for using Apache!
