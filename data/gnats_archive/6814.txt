>Description:
I was going to report a problem about setgid, but, of course, I decided to search the bug database first.

I found several people reporting the same problem, but at the bottom of each message I could see: >fix:, but the fix was not there.

I had to go to several messages until I found the solution in one of them; Now I have my server running.

What I want to report is that the bugs database should be more explicit with the fixes; it will save time to you and the users.

Just my 2 cents.  :-)
