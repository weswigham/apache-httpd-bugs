 I got this reply which seems to identify the problem, though I haven't tried recompiling it yet:

No.  Not yet.  I suspect it will be OK though.

As I stated in another posting,The gory details: I tried doing
LoadModule, and it fails, so I copied all the .c and .h files from the
ApacheModuleProxy project into the ApacheCore project.  Then I hand
edited the modules.c file and rebuilt ApacheCore. (This is all in the
instructions somewhere.) Then I just removed the comment from the
ProxyRequests On line in httpd.conf.  The only thing that isn't quite
working right yet is that I have to copy ApacheCore.dll into the ApacheD
directory where the Apache.exe resides.

It works great, although it does definitely add some delay between the
browser's request and the response (no more so than other proxies). I
have yet to try it with caching, but we have two Win95 machines here
that are running Apache as a proxy, and the two copies of the Apache
code were built on two different Win95 machines, so it's repeatable. I
hope this helps.

...

I didn't post it to the bug list because I thought they'd probably know all about this by now, ie that it's not the proxy module that's broken.  It's just the packaging of the proxy as a dll that doesn't work right now on Win 95.

An update.  One of my colleagues here has been running an 8M Apache 1.3b6 proxy cache on Win95.  (You had asked if we had any luck running the cache portion of the code.)

State-Changed-Why:
There are already several PRs on this.  It is being tracked,
and will continue to be tracked, as PR#1462.

The message you included simply says that if you don't
make it a DLL but instead compile it into the main server
it will load.  That's great, but isn't acceptable for us
to distribute it that way.  It works fine on NT and Win98,
there is just something yet unknown about win95 that
makes it fail.
