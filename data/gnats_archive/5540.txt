Unix
>Description:
Why not put the following example in INSTALL:
-----
To enable Unix DSO support, rebuild Apache as follows:
   $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE --enable-module=so
   $ make
   $ make install
----------
The syntax was not obvious to me as a newbie admin.

Thanks for using Apache (and sorry for the long delay).
