>Description:
i am designing a website by useing Mysql-database and PHP. the browsers show different chinese characters by selecting data fm Mysql-database. for example, the iterm -bank- in chinese characters (gb2312) was put into the database and the browser shows something like -hanke-. 
does the Apache have problem working out the chinese character (gb2312)? or
the PHP-Engine has problem with (gb2312). gb2312 code look like this:
automobil=汽车制造业,hotel=宾馆 饭店.
please help me!!!
Best wishes fm the harbourcity Hamburg.

State-Changed-Why:
Whatever Apache gets, it will send to the client.  You need to make sure you are telling the client what encoding to use.  I'm afraid we don't have the resources to debug some interaction between mysql and php and your code.
