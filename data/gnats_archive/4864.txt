delete all files in the logs directory.
try to shutdown apache using
:-apachectl stop
>Fix:
Store the pid, some where other than an external file.
That file should be only a reference for the user. Or

Then don't do that!

Using a pid file to store the pid in order to be able to
send signals to a running process is an extremely typical
way of doing things on Unix.  If you delete it, then of course
you can't use it to do things.  So don't delete it.

If you do delete it, all you have to do is manually find the
parent process of the httpds and kill it.
