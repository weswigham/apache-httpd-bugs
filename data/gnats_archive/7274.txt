State-Changed-Why:

This is a basic configuration question which is not really
appropriate for the bug database.  Please address questions
like this in the a user support forum like
news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.

In this case, you can probably solve the problem by
looking at the User and Group directives in httpd.conf
and make sure they point to a valid user and group.

Thanks for using Apache!
