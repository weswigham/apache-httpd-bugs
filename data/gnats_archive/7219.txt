Apache_1.3.12

 
>Description:
When I developed the module foo_initialization for the mod_foo as a dso, I found it always is executed twice. One is in http_main, another is in standalone_main.
And apache is work well. It seems no problem.
But you may take look at the log file and find out the results from initialization process is not what I want to get.
>How-To-Repeat:
1)mod_foo.c source code
/* ====================================================================
 * Apache_1.3.12
 * test the initialization of mod_foo module
 */

#include "httpd.h"
#include "http_config.h"
#include "http_conf_globals.h"
#include <stdio.h>

module MODULE_VAR_EXPORT foo_module;

{

    FILE *flog;
    
    flog=fopen(LOGLOG,"a"); 
    fprintf(flog,"%s\n","START INIT PROCESS!!!");

    pid = getpgrp();
    fprintf(flog,"PID=%d\n",pid);
 
    ap_add_version_component("mod_foo loaded!!!");
    fprintf(flog,"%s\n"," End of initialization fo mod_foo module!");
    fclose(flog);
}

static int FooTranslate(request_rec *r)
{
     return DECLINED;    
}

module MODULE_VAR_EXPORT foo_module = 
{
    STANDARD_MODULE_STUFF,
    FooInit,                   /* initializer */

    NULL,                      /* [2] header parser */
};

2)./apxs -i -a -c mod_foo.c

3)log file:
START INIT PROCESS!!!
PID=23987
 End of initialization fo mod_foo module!
START INIT PROCESS!!!
PID=23994
 End of initialization fo mod_foo module!
>Fix:
I don't know why and what happened. I only hope the initialization routine of any modules as a DSO should really be executed only once, not more than one time. Any suggesstion will be appreciated. Thanks a lot.

Comment-Added:

My appologies... I didn't mean to mark this as a "bogus report".

The double-invocation of the init function is expected
behaviour, and is necessary to support certain module
functions.

Thanks for using Apache!
