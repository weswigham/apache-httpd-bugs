>Description:
I have a bunch of JSP web pages which consist of images (called 
by "<img src=../../imageDir").

When IE 4.x is used and OS is Chinese Win98, images in JSP pages are not loaded.

In the web access log, images are not requested by IE 4 at all.  Images can be
seen if users press "Refresh" Button or if images are cached.
>How-To-Repeat:
I am afraid that the problematic web pages can only be accessed with
specific user accounts.
>Fix:
Upgrade to IE 5.

State-Changed-Why:

This does not look like an Apache bug to me.
There's nothing Apache can do if the client
doesn't request the inline images.
