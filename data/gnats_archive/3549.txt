>Description:
The name based vhost docs seem to be the source of much confusion, at least
on usenet.  Two things which could be cleared up:
1. It is confusing to have an example of name based vhosts with only one
<VirtualHost> section, since any working configuration would need at least
two.  This seems to trip people up.
2. Although most people find the part where it says "The 'main server' will
never serve any requests", they can't figure out what to do about it.  Being
a little more explicit might help.
