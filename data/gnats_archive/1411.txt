 All your bug report says is:
 
 Microsoft (R) Program Maintenance Utility   Version 1.62.7022
 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1988-1997. All rights reserved.                   
 
         cd os\win32                              
         set CFG    
 
 
 however, if you are trying to make the debug version then yes, there is a
 known problem in the makefile in 1.3b2 doing that.  It has been corrected
 and the fix will be available in 1.3b3 when it is released.
