>Description:
This is a documentation error in the httpd.conf file for the HostNameLookups directive.  (Also the documentation is abiguous).  In the conf file the comments say:
#
# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
#

This is no longer correct.  As of Apache version 1.3b6 this feature changed.  In the CHANGES file distributed with Apache and located at:
http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/CHANGES_1.3

It says under 1.3b6:
*) The CGI spec says that REMOTE_HOST should be set to the remote hosts's
     name, or left unset if this value is unavailable.  Apache was setting
     it to the IP address when unavailable.
     [Tony Finch <fanf@demon.net>] PR#1925

The REMOTE_HOST will not be available if the HostNameLookups is off.

The documentation on Apache for this directive at:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#hostnamelookups 
says nothing about what will happen if HostNameLookups is off.  The httpd.conf file comments should be deleted or updated.  

We just upgraded from 1.3b5 where this feature still worked (HostNameLookups is set to off and the environment variable REMOTE_HOST was set to the IP address) to 1.3.20 where if the HostNameLookups is off the environment variable REMOTE_HOST is blank.  This issue only requires a document change for the directive and a change in comments to the httpd.conf file.

Thank you.
>How-To-Repeat:
Documentation issue with httpd.conf.  No need to duplicate.
>Fix:
Update the httpd.conf file comments for HostNameLookups and add more detail to the documentation to explain what will happen when this directive is set to off (environment variable REMOTE_HOST will be blank).
>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 31 06:11:43 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

The config file talks about "log(ging) the names".  It is
referring to the access log, not the CGI environment.
If you look at the documentation for this directive, you
will see that it mentions both.

Thanks for using Apache!
