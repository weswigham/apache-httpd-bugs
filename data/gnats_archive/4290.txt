>Environment:
SGI Challenge; IRIX 6.2; 2 MIPS R4400 250 MHZ IP19 Chip Revision: 6.0
>Description:
I installed the binary Distribution "apache_1.3.6-IP22-sgi-irix62.tar.gz"
but the server will not start up.
In the error_log file I found this:

"Syntax error on line 461 of /tmp/APACHE_USER_TEST/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'TypesConfig', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module
not included in the server configuration"

I commented out this directive and found the next one mentioned in error_log.

I tested the same distribution on a
SGI O2; IRIX 6.3; MIPS R5000 200 MHZ IP32 Chip Revision: 2.1
before and it worked perfect.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
In my opinion, the problem can be the "IP22" of the distribution I used.

State-Changed-Why:

Have you tried to compile Apache yourself on the
IP19 box? Does it fail with the same error?
