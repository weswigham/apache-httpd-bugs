>Description:
I'm running Apache 1.2.4 and have recently installed some pages in

multiple languages. The logs have the stripped files which is not what

I want, I would prefer (and it would seem sensible) for the log to report 

index.html.en, index.html.fr etc instead I just get index.html for all 

of them.

>How-To-Repeat:
Here are 3 access alogn with their log entry (date deleted)

http://jetease.com/

   cisco4.mhri.edu.au - - [ date ] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2276

http://jetease.com/index.html

   cisco4.mhri.edu.au - - [ date ] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0" 200 2276

http://jetease.com/index.html.en

   cisco4.mhri.edu.au - - [ date ] "GET /index.html.en HTTP/1.0" 200 2276

>Fix:
I would have thought the entire file name should be reported not the

language stripped version. I guess one could create a custom log with

the language added to the filename??%3

State-Changed-Why:
The requested URI is reported ... you'd have to use customlog
to get the filename served.  This is true for all forms of
server-side negotiation.
