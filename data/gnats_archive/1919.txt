Apache 1.3b5
perl 5.004_02 for Win32 binary distribution from CPAN
>Description:
The shebang syntax #! is interpreted by Apache; the standard file association
is ignored (*.pl => c:/perl/bin/perl.exe "*.pl").

Win32 uses file associations in the registry to determine how to make 
non-executable files executable (.bat, .cmd, .pl, .tk, .py, etc.).
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure any CGI directory that has a perl script 
with a unix style #!/usr/bin/perl as the first line.
>Fix:
Apache will look for a file called /usr/bin/perl (on the default drive,
the same as Apache is installed on).  If the perl interpreter is found
there (simply by copying c:/perl/bin/perl.exe to c:/usr/bin/perl) then
Apache will load the perl interpreter and run the CGI script.

This way, CGI scripts can remain mostly unmodified between NT and Unix
hosts (CR/LF transformation may still be needed).

Note that with the 5.004_02 binary distribution, simply copying and renaming the
(8K) interpreter executable from the installed directory into c:/usr/bin
is sufficient.  The perl interpreter will find the standard installation
directory and load the required DLLs and perl library files.

The fact that NT does not see an extensionless c:/usr/bin/perl as an 
executable file does not matter

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, that does work to allow portability without changes.
Note that the current tree and 1.3b3 (although not 
1.3b5) will properly execute perl.exe even if just 
perl is named in the #! line, with the right directory of course.

At some point, Apache will probably add the feature to allow
people to use registry associations, but that is on the todo
list.

 Thanks for the quick response.
 
 All things considered, taking advantage of the 1.3b3/1.3b5 behavior
 of loading /usr/bin/perl in the near term before Apache recognizes
 *.pl as a valid extension might be a better quick fix for some than
 using the more widely publicized solution of  #!c:/perl/bin/perl.exe.
 
 We've come up against this problem before since we're a dual
 system shop.  Normally NT ignores #! lines, and Unix doesn't
 care about .pl extensions.  Taking advantage of both is the easiest
 and most painless solution we found.
 
 Just thought I'd pass the idea around.  Glad to hear that the
 registry solution is in the hopper.
