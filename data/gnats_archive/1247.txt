>Description:
  Seems you guys have a little "bug" to work out in 1.3b2. The following
situation works 100% fine in 1.2.4, and 1.3a1. I think Dean is smoking
some type of crack, personally. Anyways.

  Your new (and STILL undocumented: grrrrrrr...) "NameVirtualHost" function
is not self-explanitory as you may seem. It's implementation vs. the normal
<VirtualHost> function seems to do nothing more than break things.

  By "break things," I am referring to simple name-based VirtualHosts.

  Our server consists of ~30 VirtualHosts, using names. Our server's IP is
206.190.135.249. Our server name (using ServerName, outside of a VirtualHost
directive) is www.parodius.com. Our VirtualHosts are defines via DNS CNAMEs,
and point to 'parodius.com'.

  We define a multitude of <VirtualHost>'s, but only the *FIRST* defined
<VirtualHost> works. For instance:

    <VirtualHost blah.parodius.com>
    ...
    <VirtualHost foo.parodius.com>
    ...
    </VirtualHost>

  The result is that http://foo.parodius.com/ holds the web data/pages
for "blah". Not to mention, our default server uses this <VirtualHost>
directive for it's *OWN* default as well! WTF!

  This "new" (and may I say, "seems to be "hacked"") implementation of
VirtualHosts (with the **UNDOCUMENTED** "NameVirtualHost" directive) is
bringing the newest Apache to the apex of it's own insanity.

  It's not a configuration bug on my end, it's not "a typo." It's purely
this new botched VirtualHost code which is driving myself, and I guarentee
many other people, absolutely INSANE.

  "Thanks."
>How-To-Repeat:
  I can't give you a URL, as our web server has to be up and functional
virtually 24/7. However, try using DNS CNAMEs and <VirtualHost> name
directives to experience the same problem.
>Fix:
  Yeah, kick Dean in the ass.

State-Changed-Why:
It is quite unfortunate that you do not find pleasure in
using Apache.

Did Ken's NameVirtualHost suggestion help?  You just need
one for each IP you want to be considered for name-based
vhost matching, not one before each VirtualHost section
as he implied.

Where are you testing this from?  If your client is running
on the same box as the server, there are known issues.  Try
a client running on a seperate machine.

 	I've tried this implementation as well, placing lines
 	suc has the following into the httpd.conf:
 
 	<VirtualHost virtualhost.parodius.com>
 	NameVirtualHost 206.190.135.249:80
 	User user
 	Group group
 	ServerName virtualhost.parodius.com
 	</VirtualHost>
 
 	This results in the VirtualHost's working, but the main
 	server configuration not working -- the main server
 	then goes to the first <VirtualHost> defined, despite
 	not containing the same name (but the same IP).

 	My Client is Netscape Communicator 4.03 for Windows 95.
 	It is running on my Windows 95 box, on a network com-
 	pletly outside of where the server is.
 
 	Again, this is not the problem -- once I reverted back
 	to 1.3a1 or 1.2.4, the problem went away.

     As was pointed out, I phrased this poorly.  I meant "put this in
     your file ONCE, before any <VirtualHost> container," *not* "put this
     in front of EACH <VirtualHost>."  Sorry about the confusion.

     Good.  Can you send along some of the 'lots of logging' messages?
     Are they talking about overlaps?

     Erm, there's only *one* server defined outside the
     <VirtualHost> containers - the default or "main" server.
     Try listing the main server's details inside its own <VirtualHost>
     container, and changing the global ServerName to "localhost".  That
     way, *all* of your working servers should be defined by
     <VirtualHost> blocks, including the main one.

     This is work on the table for a future release, but I don't think
     there's a PR for it.

     This was also reported recently.  Would you please enter two
     separate "non-critical" "change-request" PRs for these?  That will
     help ensure that they don't get forgotten, the way private mail
     might or if they're encapsulated inside another PR as they are now.
 
     Thanks for the additional information; let us know what the log
     messages say and whether the change above helps.
 
     Oh, and by the way - NameVirtualHost should appear *once* for each
     IP address that has multiple name-vhosts on it, and these
     occurrences of NameVirtualHost should be before and outside any
     <VirtualHost> containers.

 	The output shows repetitious amounts of the following:
 
 [Sun Oct 19 21:57:08 1997] [warn] NameVirtualHost 206.190.135.249:80 has no VirtualHosts
 
 	One for each entry I have inserted.
 
 	To give you an *ACTUAL* configuration entry:
 
 LogLevel debug
 NameVirtualHost 206.190.135.249
 <VirtualHost archaic-ruins.parodius.com>
 User typhoonz
 Group users
 DocumentRoot /home/typhoonz/WWW
 ServerName archaic-ruins.parodius.com
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/typhoonz/WWW/cgi-bin/
 ErrorLog logs/null
 TransferLog logs/null
 </VirtualHost>
 
 	All of our <VirtualHost> entries look like this now; the
 	result is that all <VirtualHost>'s work, but our main
 	server "www.parodius.com" (also "parodius.com") goes to
 	the <VirtualHost> defined above. This <VirtualHost> is
 	the first in the list.

 	This seems more like an "excuse" to get around the bug; I don't
 	mean to seem like an asshole, but I am not willing to try this.
 	I'd prefer the bug be fixed rather than have some "configuration
 	hack". Sorry if that's rude :-(.

 	And it is so above. We have one IP, and multiple VHosts. We
 	do not have multiple IPs of any sort.
 
 	I hope you're online this evening; possibly you can find me
 	online and we can deal with this real-time. Emails back
 	and forth really do help, but they can never really let you
 	diagnose the problem up-front.
 
 	Thanks again.

 This is expected (undocumented) behaviour.  When you declare a
 NameVirtualHost then only <VirtualHost>s are expected on that address.  To
 fix it put a <VirtualHost> section first which is a copy of your main
 server config.

 Sorry, this is how it is.  It's not an excuse, it's not a bug.  It's just
 how the configuration language now works.  In future versions we will be
 removing the "main" server entirely.
 
 FWIW, if your name-vhosts are on 10.1.1.1, you can do this (before any
 other vhosts):
 
 NameVirtualHost 10.1.1.1
 <VirtualHost 10.1.1.1 _default_>
     ServerName www.parodius.com
     yadda yadda
 </VirtualHost>
 
 and it will handle all the default requests on that name-vhost address, and
 for any other address you might not specify.

Read the new documentation.  Thank you for showing absolutely

possibly have been affected.  Hence I do not understand your
hostility towards us, nor your rudeness.  You do realise that
we all have real jobs that don't include giving immediate
gratification to users of apache, right?

Take care,
