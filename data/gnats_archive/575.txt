Even with the mod_include compiled in, the appropriate AddHandler
directives in srm.conf, and several rebuilds from scratch of the
config files, Apache under DG/UX is remarkably cranky about SSI's.
A view of source from the server shows that no substitutions have
been done.

No clue - this all worked flawlessly on a BSDI box I use. :(
I can provide conf files if desired

 Are you sure you have Includes in your Options line that applies
 to that directory?  This is almost certainly a configuration
 error.
 
 Guess you may as well send your config files.
