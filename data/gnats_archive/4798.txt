 You do _not_ have this problem with a normal european or US sourced
 netscape ? Or with any version of IE ? I.e is it specific to that
 version of netscape ?

 This problem is only on Communicator 4.5 with French version and US sourced
 verson, but there is no problem with IE in any version.
 We are actually testing the 4.61 european sourced version of communicator
 but the problem seems to be still alive...

 As other use the (international) versions of NS just fine with SSL
 modules, could you also mail us the configuration. It seems likely that
 that is where the issue is.
