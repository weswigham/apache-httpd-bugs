>Description:
ListenBacklog complements SendBufferSize and the *KeepAlive* directives
for tuning the server relative to the kernel.  given the disparate networks
(and associated syn/ack tcp rtts, network path lengths, latencies, etc.) on
which one might deploy apache, this parameter is important enough to be runtime
configurable, imho.  for example, setting it an order of magnitude higher than
the current default is possible (and desirable -- think syn flood attacks) in
some kernels.

hmmm... did someone say mod_tune?

Subject: Re: config/240: Add tuning directive ListenBacklog
Date: Wed, 19 Mar 1997 16:56:08 -0700 (MST)

 
 I like the idea.  I have had to tune it myself and thought about making it
 a little more configurable but never got to it.  I think there are some
 issues that need to be clarified WRT virtual servers (it is only possible
 to have a seperate setting for virtual hosts using the Listen directive
 since all others use the same socket) and it needs to be documented well
 (so people don't go crazy modifying it for no reason and just hurt
 themself).  At the very least, it should be a define in httpd.h. 
 
 Nothing will be done about this until after 1.2, since we are in a
 feature freeze.

Was too late for 1.2 feature freeze, will re-examine 
after 1.2.

State-Changed-Why:
The ListenBacklog directive has now been implemented in
the 1.3 development source; a mildly different implementation
than the supplied patch was used.
