BSD/OS ts2.golden.net 2.1 BSDI BSD/OS 2.1 Kernel #0: Mon Mar 10 08:13:09 EST 1997
 root@ts2.golden.net:/usr/src/sys/compile/webserver26.2  i386

This system has been running 1.1.x (now 1.1.3) for a long time with no troubles.
>Description:
I can telnet to port 80 on the machine, and get a connection, but any request made
(bogus or otherwise) is cheerfully ignored.

I compiled from source, and the only changes I made was for default paths (in httpd.h)
and I turned on a couple of modules. (Configuration file available upon request). Oh yes,
and I turned on suexec support as well.

Also, as a blind attempt to fix this, I tried hacking the Configure script to add the -m486
flag which it doesn't do by default. (I am on a Pentium.) No go with that. Looked at the
known bugs, and since I only have a single listen line, the mutex lock stuff doesn't
seem to apply. (But it does host about 100 virtual domains, so perhaps I am wrong?
Clue me in if this is the case.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Um, call me and I'll put it up. I had to switch back to 1.1.3 as this is a
production server I am trying to upgrade.
>Fix:
None.

(Unless this mutex locking stuff applies, in which case I'd suggest making a note
of it in the docs for this platform.%2

State-Changed-Why:
It's quite possiblie that you need to increase the number of descriptors
available to the server.  This is covered in the FAQ
<http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html>.

You could also be experiencing the problem described in PR#467, see
<http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi/full/467>.

Please take a peek at those and report back.

Thanks
Dean
