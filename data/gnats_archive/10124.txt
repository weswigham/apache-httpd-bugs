>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Running Windows XP, Apache 1.3.23.
>Description:
When I view my website through the computer that hosts it I always see every page exactly as it should be, but when I try through outside computers the output is corrupted 1/4 of the time. At first I assumed it was a problem with my script, but every time I reload the corruption is different. I tried running IIS5.1 and IIS5, and they both ran all my pages correctly every time (tried few hundred times to make sure). I compiled Apache 2.0.32 (Mandrake-Linux 8.1) and ran in, and it ran all of my pages perfectly. The only problem I found is in Apache 1.3.23 in Windows. My site has been really screwed up lately; members can't login or even view pages half the time. It’s REALLY bothering me. I really prefer Apache to IIS, but this bug is making me look the other way.
Thank you for your support, 
Paul
>How-To-Repeat:
This might not help since I find it to be corupted only less than 1/4 of the time. http://1.xtmclan.com:2/cgi-bin/screenshots.pl
