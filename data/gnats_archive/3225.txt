>Description:
The env variables REMOTE_USER/AUTG_TYPE are set when running a cgi script from within a protected directory.

I have noticed that this usually works fine except in the case where the cgi script is executed from a page that has itself been created by another cgi script.

Under this situation the variables are not set.

Is this normal or a bug?

 I think you need to look again.  Triple check that auth is actually
 required for the CGI that is being called.
