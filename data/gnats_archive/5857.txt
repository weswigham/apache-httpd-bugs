Stop.
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"c:\program files\devstudio\vc\bin\NMAKE.EXE"' : ret
urn code '0x2'
Stop.

NMAKE.EXE outputs this on a clean install of MSVC++ 5 and a clean download/unzip of Apache 2.0a1... I realize it's a alpha release, and I'm in no means in a hurry, but I wanted to make you aware of this...
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to build apache on a NT 5 machine...

the exact syntax I used is: nmake -f makefile.nt installr

Apache 2 source is located in C:\apache\src and that is where I ran the command.
>Fix:
No clue... I'm not too good of a programmer :-(

State-Changed-Why:
I was never able to recreate this error. Download the
latest alpha and give it a try. In the future, open
Apache 2.0 bugs in our new Bugzilla database. See 
http://www.apache.org/bugs/ for more details.

Thanks for your interest in Apache 2.0.
