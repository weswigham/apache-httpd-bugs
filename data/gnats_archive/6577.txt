>Description:
Hi,
I configured the apache webserver. I finally got it to start. When I try to access the 
demo web page or the users webpage, I get 
the following error message:

================================
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.


Apache/1.3.12 Server at localhost Port 80
=============================================

I looked at the permission of the directory and files. They are all read by everyone.

Please help
