State-Changed-Why:
Do you mean that you don't have a "src/support" directory?
If that's the case, there's something wrong with the
way your distribution kit was unpacked (or packaged).
If you mean that "cd src; ./Configure; make" didn't
create src/support/htpasswd, that's expected - you
need to "cd src/support; make htpasswd" in order to
build it.
