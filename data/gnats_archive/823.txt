Complier is GNU gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
If a file has a name such as uk.map.html, Apache seems to interpret this
as a "map" file (AddHandler imap-file .map is enabled). This problem can be
overcome by putting

      AddHandler imap-file .map$

in the srm.conf file (an inspired guess !!), however this doesn't help when the
associated image is called uk.map.gif
>How-To-Repeat:
From our server you can access http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/ukinfo/uk.map.html
and save this (and the associated image) locally and then attempt access
using Apache server - you may need to hack out the absolute URL for the image
in the html file.
>Fix:
Without having ploughed through the code, no

State-Changed-Why:
I think this falls into the "don't do that" category ... unfortunately
Apache uses "." to separate components of the filename which
describe its content, encoding, and so on.  So you shouldn't use
"." unless you are indicating one of those things.

A workaround is to use "AddHandler imap-file .imap" and
rename your image maps ... or you could rename the .map
files that aren't really image maps.

There's really not a lot we can do in the server since we
need this meta information some way, and . is the way that
it's always been.
