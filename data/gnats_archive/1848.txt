>Description:
The text at http://bugs.apache.org/ should not describe the GNATS
software as "public domain", because that would imply that there
is no copyright on GNATS.
>How-To-Repeat:
please don't repeat this problem :-)
>Fix:
As GNATS is covered by the GNU GPL license, I would suggest using the
term "free". Additionally, you could use the official name "GNU GNATS"
(or "GNU PRMS").
