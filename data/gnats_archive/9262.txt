 URGENT MESSAGE!
 
 PLEASE READ COMPLETELY
 
 It is important that you read this message as soon as possible. Again, I urge 
 you to read this message to its fullest! Last year 72% of all bankruptcies 
 filed could have been avoided by adding just an extra $200 a month to the 
 household income.  We are an International E-Commerce and Mail Order 
 Company. We are looking for people with a Good Work Ethic and the 
 Desire to Earn $500 - $1,500 per Month Part Time or $2,000 - $7,500+ 
 per Month Full Time Working from Home or Office! 
 
 The demand for our product line (over 150 different products) is so great we 
 need to train more people to process the orders and service our growing 
 customer base. Right now, our industry is practically still in its infancy, but 
 by the year 2010, will be a $1 Trillion Dollar Industry!!!
 
 To better assist you in understanding E-Commerce and what the world is 
 raving about with E-Commerce and the Internet, I URGE you to read this 
 message for your own benefit in understanding what it can do for you.  
 
 We are helping people start bothlocal and foreign business. This opportunity 
 is the fastest growing industry in India, Panama, Cypress, Korea, China, and 
 Japan and, of course, the United States.

 opportunities in the past that failed to live up to their promises;  this is 
 different than anything else you are aware of! This is not a get rich 
 scheme. You must work to earn income! Your financial past does not
 have to be your financial future.
 
 "There is no security on this earth. There is only opportunity." 
 Douglas McArthur
 
 Do you feel like you are too busy earning a living to make any real money? 
 Are you tired of living "paycheck to paycheck" like I was? Do you dream 
 of a better lifestyle for yourself and your family? If so, then I urge you to 
 read on to better understand why I sent you this message. We provide the 
 system, experience and hands on training. The only thing that we can not 
 give you, but is required is that you, have the desire and that you are 
 teachable. We know that you have some level of desire because you are 
 reading this letter. Ask yourself if you are teachable? 
 
 This business fell into my lap in September of 1997.  I got started as a 
 customer or consumer and woke up when my wife made an extra $500 
 in the first week. At the time I was an Active Duty Marine living paycheck 
 to paycheck making less that $19,000 a year. I was attending college at 
 a local University and had two children. An extra $500/month would have 
 been a dream come true. We got started and in our first month earned 
 $2700 profit. In the first four months my wife and I made $19,000 profit.  In 
 just 4 months time, that’s more than I made in an entire year as an active 
 duty Marine just part time working 10 - 12 hrs a week. 
 
 Everyone involved in our business had three things in common when they 
 got started:
 
 1.	They saw an opportunity; 
 2.	They were teachable; and 
 3.	They applied what they learned. 
 
 It's THAT simple. And it's THAT POWERFUL.
 
 *************************************
 
 Imagine just for a moment that you have a home-based business that 
 provides more time with your family, Unlimited income based on YOUR efforts, 
 Freedom from commuting, Not having your kids in day care, Affordable health 
 care for your family, Significantly helping others with their lives, Loving what 
 you do and doing what you love, Having your own business/being your own 
 boss Sounds too good to be true? That's what we thought, but today our 
 dreams are coming true and now we want to help you, as others have 
 helped us!
 
 **********************************************
 
 We like to get right to the point...so here is what we have to offer you: 
 
 •	A well established, financially stable company, 2 Billion 
 dollar + sales/publicly traded;
 •	Patented, exclusive, high demand consumable products;
 •	Comprehensive, high-tech in home training;
 •	Phenomenal support system;
 •	Worldwide income opportunities (especially through E-Commerce); 
 •	Exotic paid vacations; and
 •	Minimal start up investment
 
 ARE YOU GETTING A BIT CURIOUS?
 
 GREAT! That's fine... as long as you're serious!  
 
 The average person can start earning from $25.00 - $75.00 an hour from 
 their home or office computers without dedicating a lot of time and effort.  
 Most of us have been thinking it's about time that we took advantage of 
 this Internet Craze. Throughout the Holidays and especially the last year, 
 everything that we have seen on Television and heard on the radio has 
 either started or ended with www.com and the reason why is because 
 the Internet has truly simplified shopping, which frees up more time for all 
 of us to turn into quality time. Security and convenience has been 
 technologically advanced to give us all peace of mind.  E-Commerce is 
 so rampant right now that in most states in the U.S. you can buy groceries 
 over the Internet. 
 
 This is your chance to take advantage of the E-commerce that is literally 
 changing the way the world does business.  Our marketing group will show 
 you how you can work at home using your very own E-Commerce Storefront. 
 You can work at home and use the Internet to run your business. You can 
 market our high demand consumable products that are geared and driven by 
 the needs of over 80% of the world's population.  Our products sell themselves; 
 there is no selling or need for out right sales techniques.  Also, because they 
 are high demand consumable products, return business, ongoing business, and 
 referral business is generated. By working at home, you reduce overhead, set 
 your own schedule, are your own boss, and achieve your own goals. Be an 
 entrepreneur, WORK AT HOME!
 
 Our company has been reviewed and published Wall Street Journal, Business 
 Week, Home PC, Forbes, Success, and Money, just to name a few. The 
 Market Opportunity is colossal. Over 2/3 of American homes have a computer, 
 and E-Commerce sales are increasing month after month. 
 
 The top industries in the world are 
 
 •	Medical
 •	Health 
 •	Nutrition
 •	Computer Industry
 •	Personal Care 
 •	Communication and 
 •	the Burial Business
 
 Due to the aging population of Baby Boomers, these industries are increasing 
 daily, and will continue at this rate for the next several years.  With the 
 exception of the Burial Business, The Work at Home Network puts them all into 
 one package. 
 
 One of the strongest aspects of our business is the ongoing training that is 
 offered.  We have International Training on an ongoing basis in most major 
 cities. Weekly conference calls are also available, as well as satellite 
 television training programs, online training, monthly magazines and quarterly 
 journals. 
 
 Our company does over 2.1 billion (USD) in business annually and you can be 
 a part of this growth. You will find success because we give you the blueprint 
 to follow and support your need to develop your own profitable home-based 
 business. 
 
 All we ask of you is to be willing and able to be coached and to learn. We have 
 no need for tire-kickers or window shoppers.  Please do not request our 
 "decision package" if you are not serious about changing the course of your 
 life.  By ordering your "decision package", you will receive all you need to get 
 yourself moving towards financial independence. 
 
 If you are tired of worrying about money and tired of choosing what you can live 
 without, come join the thousands of us working from home, setting our own 
 schedules, making a fortune and living out our dreams. We invite you to explore 
 how the "Work From Home" Internet Program capitalizes on today's 
 advancements in technology to help you build a successful home-based 
 business.  Have you noticed the surge of people looking to start home-based 
 businesses? Did you know that 32 million households now have home-based 
 businesses and that number grows every day? Have you asked yourself, "Why?" 
 Why are so many people, including yourself, interested in working from home? 
 
 Our parents did not search for a business to operate from home nor did their 
 friends. So, why now is it suddenly so popular? 
 
 Americans are "cocooning". We want to spend less time on the busy freeways 
 and in over-crowded shopping malls and replace that by spending more time at 
 home with our families where it is safe and warm.  This is the wave of the 
 future and we are beginning to realize with the advancement of technology, 
 that we do not need to be in an office environment in order to access the 
 marketplace and make money.  In today's world, the quickest way to build a 
 home-based business is to take advantage of the Internet craze that has hit 
 the United States and is quickly spreading around the world. 
 
 While a conventional business can cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of 
 dollars to set up and run successfully, an Internet business costs dramatically 
 less and has the potential to attract international business for just a fraction 
 of what the traditional company would spend. On average, 30% of all U.S. 
 web traffic is already international and 5% to 20% of all web sales originate 
 from outside the United States. Everyday, these percentages are radically 
 increasing.  Consumers worldwide are spending 6.6 billion U.S. dollars a year 
 in transactions over the Internet. 
 
 The awareness level and need for users, buyers, advertisers and merchants to 
 get onto the Web, and to set-up shop, has dramatically changed even from one 
 year ago. This medium of doing business is skyrocketing, and we are reaping 
 the benefits daily.   
 
 If you combine the Internet craze with people's desire to work from home and 
 set their own schedule, you have a powerful team, and here is why. Many 
 people have heard of SOHO, and no, we don't mean that hip section of New 
 York City, rather the S.O.H.O. which refers to "Small Office/Home Office." One 
 of today's the biggest explosions in the economy. The home-based business 
 has been born out of necessity. In an era where large corporations can only 
 think of downsizing, what are your options?  There is no security in Corporate 
 America any more! Not only are tens of thousands of workers and managers 
 being downsized out of their companies, but also thousands of men and 
 women are tired of the corporate "rat race" and want to retreat to a 
 home-based business.  
 
 If you decide to "stick it out" in Corporate America your choices could boil 
 down to finding a lucrative niche in the small business world, standing in line 
 at the unemployment office, or accepting a cut in pay and benefits. We were 
 all raised to give 9 hours work for 8 hours pay, and we are not backing away 
 from that. 
 
 Today's large companies have no loyalty to their employees.  Their only loyalty 
 is to the bottom line.  And the bottom line is exactly where most of us are when 
 it's time to cut back.  Your life is suddenly turned upside down because you 
 have no control over your future.  Someone who has no idea of the quality of 
 your work or the extra time you gave the company without requesting overtime 
 makes these decisions behind closed doors. They don't know about your 
 family's life: they don't understand that you just put braces on your child's 
 teeth and now have to pay for them. The job of these "decision makers" is to 
 be impersonal and unbiased in all areas except for the company's "best 
 interests." 
 
 In other words: TO THEM, YOU REALLY DON'T MATTER.
 	
 The Great American Dream is gone. Official U.S. Government reports indicate 
 that more than 3.5 million jobs have been eliminated in the past 10 years - 
 including over 2000 jobs per day last year alone - and an estimated 55% of all 
 jobs created in the next 10 years will be near minimum wage in stores, 
 restaurants, and bars. 90% of all the people in North America earn less than 
 $40,000 year and today’s two-income families are not living as well as their 
 parents did on a single income. 
 
 So what is the alternative to the to the Great American Job? 
 
 Richard Poe, former Senior Editor - "Success Magazine," describes in his 
 recent book that a shift in thinking has resulted in over 14 million people 
 working from home full-time, and another 13 million part-time. This number is 
 increasing by almost 600,000 per year. And the average work from home income 
 is $50,250 per year, about twice the average income of wage earners working 
 for someone else. By the end of the decade over 44% of us will be working 
 from home.  
 
 Home based business wage earner's success rate exceeds 85% compared 
 with small businesses such as retail shops and restaurants, that average 95% 
 failure rate within 5 years. Couple that with the flexibility we have to change 
 our schedules and set our hours. Those of us who are parents are now 
 available when our children need us, plus we no longer have the need for the 
 "foster homes" we call day care centers, where the care-givers get to see all 
 the "firsts" your child performs. 
 
 There's no wonder the number of people looking to work from home has 
 skyrocketed. 
 
 Imagine what it would be like to run an international operation if you so chose, 
 right from the comfort of your own home.  This is exactly what we offer! We 
 offer "freedom" that is available through a constant flow of income that does 
 not depend on the whims of a boss, bonuses or the economy.  
 
 Take a look at some of these statistics: At age 50, 75% of the population 
 has less than $5,000 in the bank for retirement.  At age 65, 45% of 
 Americans depend on relatives, 30% depend on charities, 23% are still 
 working (most can't afford to quit and end up working until they are no longer 
 physically capable) and Only 2% are self-sustaining. 
 
 At the present time, it is impossible to support a family of two working 
 full-time at minimum wage! For the first time in history, the current generation 
 is averaging a lower standard of living than their parents! Automation is 
 taking layoffs to record highs! According to some recent government figures, 
 out of 100 people in the United States at age 65...
 
 •	28 are dead
 •	62 are broke or dependent on the system making less than $4000 per 
 year.
 •	5 are still working
 •	4 are financially independent
 •	1 can be considered RICH 
 
 Not taking into account those who are dead at 65, this means that 93% of 
 Americans retire broke or must keep working beyond retirement! 
 
 Will Social In-Security be there for you? Will you be dead? Do you intend to 
 keep on working? 
 
 Why not be financially independent or rich!?
 
 Over the past decade, Fortune 500 companies have laid off 4.4 million workers 
 while smaller companies steadily continue to reduce their work forces. As 
 companies continue to downsize and re-organize, many professionals will seek 
 out new ways to take control of their careers. Many of these individuals have 
 forsworn traditional "nine to five" office jobs and are making their homes pay 
 off in more ways than one.  For the entrepreneur, home-based businesses 
 have become the bridge between work- crazed big cities and easy- paced 
 family-oriented small towns. Thanks to the Internet, it is no longer necessary 
 to live in close proximity to "Big Business". You can now operate that "Big 
 Business" right from your home office. 
 
 Check out these Statistics: 11% of the US market is now on the Internet 
 1,092,000 new people get Internet access each week, while approximately 
 38% of the US adult population, or 68 million US citizens' currently use the 
 Internet, according to the fall 1999 Cyber Status reports from Mediamark 
 Research Inc. This is an increase of 49% from the prior quarter, and this 
 study only counts people who have used the Internet in the last 30 days. 
 
 Ziff-Davis' Technology User Profile reported that there are 60 million PC's 
 connected to the Internet in the US, but home PC's still represent the lion's 
 share of the market, with 68 million consumers hooked up to the Internet. 
 They predict that up to $54 billion US dollars will change hands from business 
 transactions online this year. 
 
 Most people are ready to do some sort of business online, they just don't know 
 where to start. This is why we are so successful. We link-up our marketing 
 techniques with something people need, and most of all, something people want. 
 
 If you add strong work ethics, a powerful support system, along with personal 
 business coaching, you can't help but be successful. We provide not only the 
 vehicle that puts you on the road to success, but we also provide the map. 
 All you have to do is be teachable, have the desire for a better life and be 
 willing to change what you're doing now. 94% of home-based business owners 
 are happier running their own business versus working for someone else.  92% 
 recommend working from home to others. 94% plan to still be running their own 
 business in five years. 20% of home entrepreneurs reported that their businesses 
 grossed between $100,000 and $500,000 last year. 23% paid themselves annual 
 salaries of $65,000 to $350,000. 41% work at home with other family members.  
 71% think their businesses are doing as well or better than they expected. 79% 
 expect their home-based business revenues to grow this year. Your search 
 for the ideal work environment and for the ideal vehicle to wealth is over. 
 You will be able to work more flexible hours while increasing your productivity, 
 not to mention drastically cutting or eliminating your commute time, and 
 increasing your most precious commodity-quality of life. 
 
 We have developed one of the most exciting, technologically advanced 
 home-based businesses that will take you through the new millennium. We 
 don't expect you to come to us with tremendous business knowledge or a 
 successful track record. We have already figured out how to make this work; 
 all you need to do is copy what we're already doing. 
 
 Since you've gotten this far, we know you are serious about working from home. 
 Your next step will help you make some changes and learn some new skills. 
 So, let's go! 
 
 As you know, this is not a lay-on-the-couch, get-rich-quick scheme. This is a 
 REAL business and a real opportunity- one that has drawn so much interest 
 from people that we had to put this screening process in place to help us 
 determine who to work with. Our company has been in business for more 
 than 20 years, is publicly held and traded on the NASDAQ. It is important 
 that you realize that we can help you build a powerful and profitable business.  
 
 We have an explosive, start to finish, proven Internet Marketing system. And 
 we are offering you this simple easy method where you can make money 
 working for yourself, over the Internet, from the comfort of your home or 
 office.  You can earn $1,000 to $7,000 per month working around your 
 current job and your family's schedule.  Our system works regardless of your 
 background or computer knowledge. We provide the system, experience 
 and hands on training. 
 
 Our business is bursting at the seams, so we ONLY have time to work with 
 serious, motivated people who are ready to make changes in their life NOW! 
 And because of the time we spend with each of you as we help you get your 
 business off the ground, we have a limited number of openings available.  Here 
 is what you need to do... 
 
 STEP 1. You must call our toll free "International Internet Business hotline and 
 listen to some of the members of our team talk about the success of their new 
 home based businesses.  EVEN IF YOU ARE CALLING THIS NUMBER 
 INTERNATIONALLY, I URGE YOU TO CALL  RIGHT NOW.  This is part of 
 our job-to introduce you to many others who took a step of faith (like you're 
 ready to), and whose lives have changed because of it.
 
 This call is for everyone. i.e. former Military Service Members, Executive 
 Professionals and Laborers, Doctors and Nurses 1-800-708-RICH and enter 
 Access Code 4400; then to learn about our industry and company

 This 10-minute call is a 24-hour toll free for all that is in the United States; 
 however if you are International I urge you to dial this number now and listen 
 to this short message and take some notes. 
 
 **********************************************
 CAUTION! This Access Code expires on January 5th 2002 
 (So call right now!)
 
 **********************************************
 
 IMPORTANT! DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 2 UNTIL YOU HAVE LISTENED 
 TO THE CALL MENTIONED IN STEP 1
 
 **********************************************
 
 If you are unsure and need more information, we have put together a "How to 
 do business over the Internet" decision package that will help you determine 
 whether our business is for you or not. This step is only for individuals who 
 have the desire to control their own future and who want to work from their 
 homes and earn the kind of income that will give you the life you deserve. 
 This decision package contains approximately three hours of information 
 about our explosive Internet business and it also begins your training.  You 
 will receive a manual that explains how, why and what we are doing, a 
 video where you'll meet us and see exactly how our business works and 
 an audiotape to further help you with your decision. Your package also 
 contains the name and telephone number of your personal coach who will 
 be working with you on a daily basis, helping you make money in your first 
 week. In other words, you will receive all of the information you will need to 
 make a decision to determine if this is for you. 
 	
 After you request your "International Decision Package", and go through all 
 the materials, we will call you and your personal training program will begin. 
 At that point, we will also be happy to locate the nearest training to you, 
 which are available in numerous translations. We have training being 
 conducted in over 39 different languages worldwide! 
 
 This package acts only as a way for you to review information about our 
 business and begins your training without risk. This step eliminates the people 
 who are not serious and allows us to work with those of you who are. Please 
 recognize the importance of this step. We simply do not have the time to spend 
 with people who are merely curious, which is why we designed this package to 
 provide you with all of the information you will need to make a decision and 
 determine if this is for you. If we spent our time answering e-mail requests for 
 additional information, we'd not only be duplicating the effort we put into 
 developing the decision package, but we'd also be taking valuable time away 
 from running our business and training new people. Once you start working 
 with us, we're sure you will appreciate our spending time training you instead 
 of responding to curious e-mails all day long. 	
 
 Since we don't spend countless hours answering the tireless questions of the 
 curiosity-seekers, you benefit, because it frees us up in order to dedicate 
 ourselves to your success. When we spend time with you, we know we are 
 working with someone who, like us, is committed to a better lifestyle. What is 
 Your Future Worth? Decide for yourself and for your family what it is you want 
 and by when you want to achieve it. Only you can determine how dedicated 
 you are to achieving your dreams.  
 
 Hopefully, you won't find yourself relying on your friends and family for 
 direction and salvation. They cannot provide that for you - only you can do 
 that. You need to make a decision to either give this a shot or to continue 
 down the path you're on. Most likely, if you have read this far, you have 
 already made the decision to make some healthy changes in your life.  When 
 we were looking at this "Work From Home" Opportunity for the first time, just 
 like you, we were nervous and thought that maybe this wouldn't work. Like 
 you, we doubted we could really achieve our dreams. We went for it any way 
 and now we are making an incredible income, working from home, and for 
 most of us- it's a dream come true. We don't have a boss to answer to or a 
 clock to punch.
 
 All you need to do now is take action. Take action by ordering your "Decision 
 Package" and we'll be there to help you through your questions and then to 
 work with you to build your own "Work From Home" Internet Business. But 
 please don't request more information unless you are committed to improving 
 your life. If you are ready to learn and you are serious about achieving a 
 brighter future and a better life, then we are committed to you.  We are ready 
 to give you the same step-by-step plan we used to build our fortune. There will 
 be no surprises. We know exactly what to do and how to coach others to be 
 successful within the same system. Our Program works. It's already happening 
 for hundreds of people. Why not you? Right now, take the next  step, and get 
 started on your way to a brighter lifestyle.  
 
 STEP 2: To get started request your decision package only after you have 
 completed STEP 1 please call our international 24 hour order hotline at 
 1-206-222-2829. International callers and for United States, Canada, and 
 Mexico callers please also dial 1-206-222-2829. 
 
 We are willing to train you and work with you, as others have done with us, to 
 help secure your financial future. But remember we only work with those that 
 truly have the desire and ambitions to work-we don't have time to work with 
 couch potatoes! Successful people do what unsuccessful people won't. 
 
 So develop a sense of urgency and give your desires value!  
 Procrastination is the biggest killer of success and you can now break that cycle! 
 
 REMEMBER, for things to change, you have to change and for things to get better, 
 you have to get better. 
 
 Order your materials today, and when they arrive, review everything thoroughly 
 BEFORE calling your personal coach.
 
 Remember the importance of following directions- we are looking for people 
 who are teachable and willing to work. We're very excited about our future and 
 we know you will be, too!! Until we speak personally, thank you and have a 
 great day! 
 
 Again please follow STEP 2: To get started or request your decision package 
 only after you have completed STEP 1 please call our international 24 hour 
 order hotline at 1-206-222-2829. International callers and for United States, 
 Canada, and Mexico callers please also dial 1-206-222-2829.
