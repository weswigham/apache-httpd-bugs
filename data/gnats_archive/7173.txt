Windows 98... came with book "PHP Fast & Easy web development" by Julie Meloni 
>Description:
a similiar problem as #10 in the FAQ... However the suggested resolution did not
solve the problem.  I still get "Can not determine host name.  Use ServerName 
Directive to set it manually" when trying to run Apache.exe from a DOS window.
I went to Network in control panel and enabled DNS, I also had to supply a Host
 name so I typed in localhost.  The configuration httpd.conf file as the
following entry: ServerName localhost.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
