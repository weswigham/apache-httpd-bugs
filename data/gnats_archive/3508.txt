State-Changed-Why:
This is already reported numerous times in the bugdb.  It
is due to a broken compiler doing incorrect things.  Please use
gcc or check with IBM to see if a fix is available for the
AIX compiler.

 The version of the C compiler you have from IBM has a bug in it, which is
 seen from this small code segment...
 
 static const char a[] = "astring";
 const char *const g = a;
 int main() {
   const char *const b = a;
   printf("%p %p\n",g,b);
 }       
 
 
 They are to be providing an official PTF or APAR sometime this century.
 I know a fix is available as I have a backdoor one.  I will change
 this PR to analyzed, and provide you with the URL for the fix when
 available.
 Thanks for using Apache ( in the meantime use gcc ).

State-Changed-Why:
The AIX compiler problem which gave the error of
"on Expected </Files> but saw </Files>"  has been fixed.
+  A set of PTF's which correct the problem are available from:
+  http://service.software.ibm.com/support/rs6000
+  The PTF's are:  U462005, U462006, U462007, and U462023 through
+  U462030.  The PTF's have been tested and do indeed fix the problem.

Thanks for using Apache
