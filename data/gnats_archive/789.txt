>Description:
The perl code example in #31 of the Apache FAQ is flawed in 3 ways.

a) the regex is wrong as it allows /foonph-cgi (due to the /*).
b) printf is not needed. print should be used.
c) no semi colon should be after the if statement.

see the way to fix it.

the perl code is now:

};

Right you are, though the correct RE is m:^/*nph-:.  Fixed.

>b) printf is not needed. print should be used.

Using printf is not an error, but you're right - print
is definitely better here.  Fixed.

>c) no semi colon should be after the if statement.

This isn't an error, either, but essentially the same
reasoning applies.  Fixed.

These changes will appear on the web site shortly, and
will be in the documentation included in the next release.
Thank you for pointing this out, and for using Apache!
