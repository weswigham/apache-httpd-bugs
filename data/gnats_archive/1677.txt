>Description:
It would be helpful to be able to use the LogFormat format tokens (%f, etc...) in
the Header directive to allow more flexible header values.

This came up in reference to the HTTP/1.1 Content-Location header, the definition
of which says in part:

	The Content-Location entity-header field MAY be used to supply the     
	resource location for the entity enclosed in the message  when that     
	entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested       
	resource's URI. In the case where a resource has multiple entities     
	associated with it, and those entities actually have separate locations
	by which they might be individually accessed, the server should provide
	a Content-Location for the particular variant which is returned.

(Taken from:
<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-01.txt>, 
section 14.15.)

In order to do this, it would be helpful to be able to use the %f token from
mod_log_config in the Header directive, plus an additional "request directory"
token %d, like this:

	Header set Content-Location "%d%f"

In addition to this example, it seems like token-based header values would 
generally be a worthwhile addition to mod_headers.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
There are conceivably other modules that would want to use the LogFormat tokens,
so it seems to me like it might be helpful to make Config-file token-parsing
available to any module that explicitly requests it.  Maybe provide the standard
tokens that mod_log_config allows, and let a module add in new tokens (like the
%d token suggested above) as desired (or not if simpler config files are 
preferred -- you could make everyone use the same token set to avoid confusion).

I would be happy to take a run at this if people agree that it would be 
worthwhile and if someone will point me at the right file to which it should be
added

State-Changed-Why:
This will almost certainly not appear in the 1.2.* sequence
of the Apache Web server.  I am marking the report as
suspended so it can be revisited when we next take a pass
at the proposed feature list.  If you want to give it
a try, I would say mod_headers.c is a good place to
start.
