Win32 NT 4.0 sp4
Apache 1.3.9 and 1.3.12
>Description:
One of my clients was starting 1.3.6 apache in MS NT4.0 with the command
> cd C:\CurrentWorkingDir
> apache\apache -d apache -f conf/httpd.conf

CurrentWorkingDir is a parent dir to apache.  This worked in ver 1.3.6
but does not in 1.3.9 or 1.3.12. The newer versions reports the error

Could not open ... C:/CurrentWorkingDirapache/conf/httpd.conf 
( Notice the lack of dir. delimiter after CurrentWorkingDir )

Starting 1.3.9 or 1.3.12 with the command line 
   apache\apache -d ./apache -f conf/httpd.conf

does seem to work with 1.3.9 or .12, but not with 1.3.6

Hope this helps,

Try the above on a win32 platform.

State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:39:33 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
