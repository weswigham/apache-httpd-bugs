I configured for gcc and /usr/local/apache and --with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl
no other options were used.
>Description:
using a recent gnu make, the following are the last few lines before the
make exits fatally:

gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DULTRIX -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I../lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED `

It is not very descriptive what went wrong here. Can you help?

Your help is much appreciated!

          Reply to:   Re: config/6043: ./configure is clean, but make
 fails
 Hi there, I seem to have fixed it myself:
 
 Changes to fix it (server seems to be working now):
 
 in top make file, I deleted the || exit 1 bit below, as running the
 src/support 
 Makefile on its own in that directory did not result in any error
 messages... 
 Something screwed up here, but I do not quite understand what. (I also
 noticed
 that some files were compiled every time I restarted the make, even
 though
 I had not touched the source code, or the make file...)
 
 (Make: 2.79, sed 3.02, gcc: 2.95.2, ULTRIX 4.4)
 
 build-support:
         @echo "===> $(SRC)/support"; \
         case "x$(PLATFORM)" in \
           x*390*) _C89_STEPS="0xffffffff"; export _C89_STEPS;; \
         esac; \
         cd $(TOP)/$(SRC)/support; $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) all ; \
 #cd $(TOP)/$(SRC)/support; $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) all || exit 1; \
 ...
