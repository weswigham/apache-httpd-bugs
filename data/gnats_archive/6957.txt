>Organization:
>Environment:
FreeBSD 4.1.1-STABLE, gcc 2.95.2
>Description:
"HeaderName filename" directive does not work for filenames with no
extension, nor for filenames without a specifically defined MIME type.
So "HeaderName headerfile" fails, even if DefaultType is set to
text/plain, while "HeaderName headerfile.txt" succeeds, because "txt"
is defined as "text/plain" in mime.types.
This is a change from older Apache 1.3.x behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a directory with two files in it named "h" and "h.txt".
Create ".htaccess" with the entry "HeaderName h" and then view
the directory index through Apache.  Try again with "HeaderName h.txt".
>Fix:
Maybe mod_autoindex isn't checking the default MIME type to make sure
it knows how to handle the header file its given?
