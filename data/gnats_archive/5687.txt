>Description:
Using additional characters - including slashes - behind a script or document
in a URL puts them into PATH_INFO, which is fine.
I was quite surprised to see apache misinterpret the base64-encoding (%2f") 
of the slash character for a real slash, ending up in a 404.

Just in case this is not a feature, I thought I'd let somebody know.
