>Description:
I use Apache as a (pure, non-caching) proxy.  If I try to access a URL of the form
<http://www.bell-labs.com:/>, Apache reports a Bad Request.  From my reading of
the URI specification (RFC 2396), this is a valid, albeit quirky, URL:
	 port          = *digit

The problem would appear to be in proxy_util.c:ap_proxy_canon_netloc(), which
decrees a null port number (line 266) to be invalid.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
The code that parses hostnames and ports should probably just toss the extra ':',
but a simple fix is to change the code from:
        if (i == 0 || strp[i] != '\0')
            return "Bad port number in URL";
        *port = atoi(strp);
        if (*port > 65535)
            return "Port number in URL > 65535";
    }
to
        if (strp[i] != '\0')
            return "Bad port number in URL";
        else {
            *port = atoi(strp);
            if (*port > 65535)
                return "Port number in URL > 65535";
        }
