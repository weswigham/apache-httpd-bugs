>Description:
We are running an Apache with about 30 virtual hosts. All error messages
from all virtual hosts are logged into a single error.log. In some
cases I'd like some more informations in the error messages.

Example:
[Thu Mar 26 13:01:51 1998] [error] File does not exist: /WWW/domains/sz-newsline/html/extra/gifs/btlinie.gif
The hostname/IP would be a useful information


[Thu Mar 26 13:27:59 1998] [error] request failed for 193.45.114.120, reason: URI too long
The virtual host would be useful. Without this information I have to look
into every access.log of very virtual host.

Best regards
Andreas Jung

Yup there's definately some stuff lacking in the 1.3 error
messages... which is on the list of things to fix.
