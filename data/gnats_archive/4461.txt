Linux i686 Kernel 2.3.3 glibc-2.1.1
>Description:
glibc-2.1 uses 32 bit user IDs while the kernel uses 16 bit.
Thus the default for this, #-2 or #-1, is interpreted differently.
Under glibc-2.0.7 #-2 was 65534, now under glibc-2.1+ it is 2^32-2.

Thus apache starts up successfully. But each child tries to set
group ID to 2^32-2 which doesn't exist. So all children die, and
apachhe terminates, too.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Use real group IDs like 65534 in httpd.conf-dist

State-Changed-Why:

You obviously need to supply a replacement value yourself.
Defaults are just that: placeholders that work best for
the majority of systems.  If a default doesn't work on
your system, you need to override it.
