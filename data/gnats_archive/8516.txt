>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT4, SP6a, German, non-default installation (no default paths of prog dir and winnt dir), apache_1.3.22-win32-no_src.msi distribution
>Description:
apache does not install correctly, there is no services entry, no start/stop batch in the program menu. It might look like the installation thinks, this is Win9x installation (warning about the missing sock2 patch for Win9x), menus in the user settings, not in the 'all users' structure. apache does start in 'command box' mode.
>How-To-Repeat:
Maybe the german language, the unusual directories (no c:\winnt and no "c:\program files"?? Installed apache on drive "g:\blah\blah\"
>Fix:
use the script of apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src-r2.msi or check what you changed.

 Where did you download the .msi from (dev.apache.org or www.apache.org?)
 What file did you download?  Please check the current release version
 at http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/ and report back,
 thanks!

A test install package was improperly transferred to the

 If still important:
 
 From http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/
 The file apache_1.3.22 with and without source
 
 But as I don't see them on this location anymore, you might have found
 some error already.
