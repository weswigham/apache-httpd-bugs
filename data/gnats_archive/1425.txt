uname-a:  SunOS scooter 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
compiler: gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Shortly after starting Apache 1.3b2 (5-20 minutes), the server will no longer
respond to HTTP requests. Clients hang with messages like "Server contacted,
waiting for reply..."

Connections to the server's port are not refused, but after sending an HTTP
request (and newlines to end the request header), nothing is ever returned.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have reverted to 1.2.4 on my system.

State-Changed-When: Mon Nov 17 17:21:51 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This sounds like a known bug that has been reported several
times on Solaris and fixed in the current source tree.

Please try changing the:
     #define USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
in conf.h under the SOLARIS2 section to:
     #define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

State-Changed-When: Sat Feb 14 05:30:52 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Assumed fixed by the suggested compilation change, or by
upgrading to 1.3b3 which should have the pthreads problem
fixed.
