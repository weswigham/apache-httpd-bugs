RedHat Linux 6.0, jdk117v3, jsdk2.0.  I have everything installed in thier own
respective dirs in /usr/local/
>Description:
compiler reports: class JServDefs not found in class org.apache.jserv.JServ
public class JServ extends HttpServlet implements JServLogChannels, JServDefs {

The first time I got this error, I just appended the JServDefs.java file to the
JServ.java file and it worked (I know this is a gnarly hack).  Upon further 
inspection, I noticed that all the .java files in this dir had a corresponding
.class file and for JServDefs there were only a .java file and a .in file (?)
I compiled JServDefs ('javac JServDefs.java') and then built jserv again without
errors.  In between my two attempts I nuked the src dir., so my first hack was nuked 
and didn't play a part in the second success.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
It seems that maybe the install script misses compiling this file and leaves
the JServDefs.in file around as eveidence that it didn't complete it's job?

State-Changed-Why:
We use GNU configure scripts as our Unix build process. 
When run properly, the configure script will do replacements
in the .in files and rename them to remove the .in suffix. 
(Hence making things like javac compile correctly.) JServDefs.java simply defines a few things like the version
 of Apache JServ. configure does the replacements in that
 file so that we do not have to edit it each time just to get
 the proper version number included.

So, the realy problem is that you didn't follow the INSTALL
document instructions and run configure first. ;-)
