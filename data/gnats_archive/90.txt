>Description:
Okay, I just got the Latest Apache version 1.2 source code for Linux
machines and placed into a subdir. I used the 'Configuration' file as is
(it appeared to have options set for Linux), then ran 'make' (gcc270).
Compilation proceeded for abt 12 files then compiled coughed and reports
"mod_auth_msql.c:394 msql.h: No such file or directory", the compiler
is correct, no such file exists... (updatedb, locate msql.h).

I assume I have to try an earlier release of Apache, get a successful
compile, then un-tar the 1.2 version over top of the older one to
get the msql.h file? I will try to look at an earlier version to see
if the file can be found there (first) then place the 'msql.h' file into
apropriate subdir on 1.2 version...
>How-To-Repeat:
take a virgin machine (not a developers machine) and compile the Linux source?

State-Changed-Why:
It does not try to compile that unless you uncomment the 
msql_auth_module line in Configuration.  Unless you have
mSQL stuff installed, don't uncomment it.
