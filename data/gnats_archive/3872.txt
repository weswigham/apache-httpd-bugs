>Environment:
SunOS wdev 5.5.1 Generic_103640-14 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
I've got an authentication module that sets an encrypted cookie on a successful
authentication, and sets it in the r->err_headers_out table so that it'll
survive subrequests.  When the target URL is a cgi script that cookie ends up
sent to the user twice because it gets duplicated in the 
util_script.c ap_scan_script_header_err_core() function.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I commented out line 457 of the 1.3.3 util_script.c,
> ap_table_do(set_cookie_doo_doo, cookie_table, r->err_headers_out, "Set-Cookie", NULL);
because it doesn't look like you'd want to preload the temp cookie_table with 
those set-cookie headers unless you were also going to remove them from
err_headers_out, since the entire cookie_table gets appended to err_headers_out
later.

 Commenting out the ap_table_do line would pose troubles if there were two
 Set-Cookie headers already in err_headers_out... I'm pretty sure the patch
 below is the right way to fix it.  Can you test to make sure it works for
 you? 
 
 Thanks

yup  it's a bug -- the suggested fix isn't quite right though,
