>Description:
When I attempt to test the cgi script using apache, I get the following message:
Internal server Error 500.Meanwhile, I find out a record in the error log file:
couldn't spawn child process c:/program files/apache server/apache/cgi-bin/printenv.pl.
I have tried all the ways I can, but it's still not working.What could be the 
problem down there?Bug?

p/s: sorry for asking such a question.In fact,I have gone through the database
and I found the similar question.But as I am a newbie,I hope you will know my 
presenting circumtance.Thank you.

Best Regards,
Vijay Shanker
