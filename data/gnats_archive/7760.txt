>Description:
It would be nice if there was a little more consistency in the
options used to enable and disable modules on the configure
command line.  Specifically,

1. There is --enable-MODULE, --enable-modules=MODULE-LIST, and 
--disable-MODULE, but no --disable-modules=MODULE-LIST
and the same for --disable-mod-shared

2. There is --enable-modules=all|most but not --enable-most or
--enable-all or --disable-all (the last of which would be 
very useful for people doing minimal installs)

Either these two forms of --enable/--disable should be made
consistent with each other, or one of them should be 
removed.
