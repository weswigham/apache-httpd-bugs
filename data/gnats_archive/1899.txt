>Description:
DocumentRoot is /vol1/apache/htdocs

I have successfully used authentication for a directory under the Document Root
using the following in access.conf:
#
# Prevent directory browsing and .htaccess files in the main tree
#
<Directory />
        AllowOverride None
        order deny,allow
        deny from all
</Directory>


<Directory /vol1/apache/htdocs/net/priv>
        AllowOverride None
        AuthName netpriv
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /vol1/apache/security/passwd
        AuthGroupFile /vol1/apache/security/group
        require group netpriv webadmin
</Directory>

Attempted access to any file in the directory pops up a password dialog
box as expected & I can access stuff after giving it the right info.
Note that this directory is under the DocumentRoot.

However, if in srm.conf, I set up an alias with the directive:
Alias   /mrtg   /var/mrtg

and then use a similar construct to provide access control:
<Directory /var/mrtg >
        AllowOverride None
        AuthName netpriv
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /vol1/apache/security/passwd
        AuthGroupFile /vol1/apache/security/group
        require group netpriv webadmin
</Directory>

and ask for http://server/mrtg/x.html (where x.html exists & has permissions),
I simply get a message:

  Forbidden
  You don't have permission to access /mrtg/x.html on this server

without ever being prompted for the password. (Whether or not I have
previously authenticated to one of the groups does not matter. I get the
same results if this is the first access after bringing up the browser).

Note, if instead of the restrictive access show above, I instead use the
following, I have no problem accessing the files (as expected - unfortunately 
NOBODY has any problems ;)

<Directory /var/mrtg>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride AuthConfig
        order allow,deny
        allow from all
</Directory>

 Are there any errors in the error_log?

 (I have not received your direct e-mail, for whatever reason, but I saw
 your update in the bug database...)
 
 I just re-configured the access.conf file to:
 
 <Directory /var/mrtg >
         AllowOverride None
         AuthName netpriv
         AuthType Basic
         AuthUserFile /vol1/apache/security/passwd
         AuthGroupFile /vol1/apache/security/group
         require group netpriv webadmin
 </Directory>
 
 HUP'd the server and tried accessing - the following is from the error
 log:
 
 [Tue Mar  3 08:56:48 1998] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
 [Tue Mar  3 08:56:48 1998] Server configured -- resuming normal operations
 [Tue Mar  3 08:57:08 1998] access to /var/mrtg/techctr1.5.html failed for
 172.23.28.146, reason: Client denied by server configuration
 
 
 There was NO prompt for a username/password and this was a fresh (Netscape
 4.03) session.
 
 FYI:
 # ll -d /var/mrtg
 drwxrwxr-x   2 sorrell  staff      32768 Feb 27 17:30 /var/mrtg/
 # ll /var/mrtg/techctr1.5.html
 -rw-rw-r--   1 sorrell  staff       7104 Feb 27 16:15
 /var/mrtg/techctr1.5.html
 
 Thanks for looking into this -

 Anything happen if you remove the indicated space?

 Oh I didn't read this last time.  You're probably getting this because
 you've got some global directive like:
 
 <Directory />
 order deny,allow
 deny from all
 </Directory>
 
 If so, you should add: 
 
 order allow,deny
 allow from all
 
 To the <Directory /var/mrtg> section.

 Dean,
 That did it! THanks for the help (BTW, in the initial bug report, I did
 have the access.conf which had the restriction paragraph on /).
 
 Thanks again for your help!
