uname -R -a: IRIX indra 6.5 6.5.3f 01221642 IP22
SGI's MIPSpro C compiler, version 7.2.1
Problem occurs no matter what compiler options I use.  My configure script looks
like this:

env LDFLAGS="-n32 -mips3 -Wl,-s,-x" OPTIM="-n32 -O3 -mips3 -TARG:processor=r4000:platform=ip22_4k" configure --prefix=/disk1/httpd/apache --enable-suexec --suexec-caller=httpd --suexec-uidmin=100 --suexec-gidmin=19 --suexec-safepath="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bsd:/usr/freeware/bin:/usr/bin/:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/lib/print" --enable-module=unique_id --enable-module=mime_magic --enable-module=rewrite --enable-module=speling --enable-module=auth_dbm --enable-module=auth_anon --enable-module=auth_digest --enable-module=cern_meta --enable-module=headers --enable-module=expires --enable-module=info --enable-module=so --enable-rule=PARANOID --enable-shared=max --verbose
>Description:
I've got the following type of environment set up in our http.conf file:

<Directory /full_path_to_protected_directory>
   AuthName "protected area"
   AuthType Basic
   AuthUserFile /full_path_to_password_file
   AuthGroupFile /full_path_to_group_file
   require group authorized
   Satisfy all
   AllowOverride None
   Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks Indexes Includes MultiViews
   Order deny,allow
   Deny from all
   Allow from .vigyan.com
   <Limit PUT DELETE PATCH PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK>
      Deny from all
   </Limit>
</Directory>

     When I used my standard Web browser (NCSA's X Mosaic 2.7b5) authorization
would always fail.  I telneted into the Web site to check headers and this is
what I saw:

% telnet machine_name 80
Trying 123.456.789.123...
Connected to machine_name.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /protected_directory/ HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.0 401
Server: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix)
Content-type: text/html
WWW-Authenticate:

     I tried all sorts of things to track the problem down.  Finally I discovered
if I change the AuthName line so that the space was an `_' AND I deleted the quotes
around everything, it works.  Here is the working headers:

% telnet machine_name 80
Trying 123.456.789.123...
Connected to machine_name.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /protected_directory/ HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
Date: Fri, 01 Oct 1999 14:03:21 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix)
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="protected_area"
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

    If you notice, I now get more information on the first line, a Date line, and
the correct information in the `WWW-Authenticate:' line.  Before submitting this
report, I checked the bug archive and found some similar, but not exactly the same
type of bug reports.  Those did, however, lead me to my work around.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
    Don't know how you want to fix it.  The AuthName doesn't accept blanks in the name
unless the whole thing is quoted.  However, this causes messed up headers.  Either the
the source needs to be changed to allow AuthName's with blanks or change the documentation
to say that blanks in names isn't valid.

Are you positive that you don't have an "ErrorDocument 401"
directive somewhere redirecting 401s to some broken CGI
script?

 Exactly what were the headers in this case, ie. without the ErrorDocument
 directive?

      Same as the ones I posted to the case.  Using the standard internal error
 routine didn't have any effect on the headers sent back.

 Yet you are _positive_ the body was the standard Apache error response and
 you don't have any other script configured elsewhere for a 401?
 
 The headers you sent originally do not match with anything Apache could
 output without a ErrorDocument 401 unless something is really messed up 
 or you made some other unusual changes elsewhere...

      YES, I'm positive.  I made sure error 401 only used the internal routines
 and I even saw the standard Apache error message from the browser.  I'm sorry,
 but Apache did output those headers and not a local error routine.  I have not
 changed ANY Apache source files.  I ran the configuration script with the
 parameters I posted.  The later tries were with Apache's own error routines for
 error 401.  The messed up headers are not that different than the correct ones,
 there is just a lot of information missing from them.

      I haven't heard from you in over a week and was just wondering what was
 going on and if you needed any more information on this bug.
