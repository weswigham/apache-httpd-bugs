>Description:
I installed my server in \program files\internet applications\apache.
When I attempted to start the server with:
apache -s -f /Program Files/Internet Applications/Apache/Conf/httpd.conf

I recieved the same error message endlessly:
fopen: unable to open file
Unable to open config file: Progra

When I changed the config file directive to /progra~1/intern~1/apache/conf/httpd.conf
everything worked.

I then ran apache -i /progra~1/intern~1/apache/conf/httpd.conf. Apparently the -f 
parameter is not passed to the service initialization, so the service did not
know where to look for the config files and would not start.

I remedied all this by installing in the default location... but it would be nice to
be able to install under Program Files.

Try enclosing the filename in doublequotes (").

 Dean, I tried that... no go. I should have mentioned it in the bug
 report actually, sorry. Same behavior.  Enclosing things is "'s works in
 the conf files themselves (like DocumentRoot and ServerRoot) but does
 not seem to work for command line args.

 Oh yeah, I'm rusty on these dos-relative operating systems.  DOS/win/OS2
 they all get the full command line without the benefit of proper parsing
 by a shell.  I believe the cmdline() function returns the command line
 without the naive argv/argc busting that's passed to main(). 
 
 Someone needs to write our own argv/argc buster.  There may be a more
 intelligent one already in the Microsoft C library... I know there is a
 better one with WATCOM's C library.
 
 What a crock, eh?
