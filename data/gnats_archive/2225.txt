>Description:
Downloaded apache_1_3b6_1.exe (2657 Kb) on May 12.
Executed the .exe and installed apparently sucessfully
(except the README was not shown).
Installed again - this time choosing the Custom Instal option and selecting all
modules.
Attempted to follow instructions in install.html.
Discovered that the binary httpd was not present in the directory /src/ (or
anywhere else on the machine).
Searched bug database - apparently no one else has reported this problem

State-Changed-By: brian
State-Changed-When: Wed May 20 05:56:46 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
It should be at the root level of the installation directory,
one level up from src/ and modules/, and called "Apache.exe".
It's rather small but that's because all of its functionality
is done as .dll's.
