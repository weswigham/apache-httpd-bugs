apache
>Environment:
AIX 4.3.3.0, Sybase DB-Library 10.0.1
>Description:
A cgi program connects to a DB-Lib server on TCPIP network to get data from an
external database. 
Sometimes, the connection is aborted with a system error 9 (bad file number),
and no future connection is possible.
I need to stop apache and start again to resolve and unlock this situation (graceful command is without any effect).
I precise that the same procedure runs well when activated in a other environment which not use apache.
I don't know how to correct this problem.
Sorry for my English and thank for your help.
