Windows 95 - I'm using the precompiled version for Apache 1.3b2,

>Description:
The DirectoryIndex directive seems not to work on Windows95.  Having installed 
Apache and ran it on my PC ("pentium" on my LAN):

     http://pentium/index.htm works
     http://pentium/ gives a "Not Found" message.

Similarly 
     http://pentium/home/index.htm works
     http://pentium/home/ gives a "Not Found" message.

My access.conf file includes:

     <Directory e:/localweb/hougie/htdocs>
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
     </Directory>

My srm.conf file includes:

     DocumentRoot e:/localweb/hougie/htdocs
     DirectoryIndex index.htm index.html

My error_log includes:
[Sun Oct 19 17:34:50 1997] [error] (2)No such file or directory: File does not exist: e:/localweb\hougie\htdocs\

and my access log includes
194.112.38.163 - - [19/Oct/1997:16:57:12 +0100] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 404 5979  <== I have an ErrorDocument

I though this looked like I must have made a configuration error, so I posted 
a message in Newsgroup: comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows (message-ID: 
<344b6254.25450662@news.dircon.co.uk>).

Bill Waldron (wjw@nospam.bwaldron.com) posted a follow-up message 
(Message-ID: <62e520$fa4@nntp02.primenet.com>):

which gives me enough confidence to suggest it's an error in Win95.

I guess there may be some significance in the fact that the error log shows 
e:/localweb\hougie\htdocs\, although the DocumentRoot directive shows
e:/localweb/hougie/htdocs.  

The readme file includes 
Known Problems
--------------
- On Windows 95, there seems to be a problem spawning cgi scripts, since
Windows 95 seems to require \'s in the path (unlike NT, which accepts /'s).

Maybe this is another aspect of the same problem?
