any
>Description:
ap_open_piped_log is used in mod_log_config but not in the NCSA-compatibility
log modules, which call spawn_child directly with their own child function.
Also, they do not call ap_server_root_relative.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Replace the existing open_agent_log and open_referer_log functions with ones
derived from open_config_log.
