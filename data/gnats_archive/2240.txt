>Description:
When loosing connection to the browser, my cgi-script gets a TERM-signal.
But when I go on executing the script (e.g. by $SIG{TERM}=SIG_IGN) the script
aborts after about 3 seconds. But I receive no more signal (maybe an KILL ?) to
handle with.
This behavior is independent from writing to the browser, even writing to disk
after receiving the TERM-signal doesn´t help.
As you see in my example i tried to catch all the known signals.
Only KILL cannot be snatched. So i think Apache sends me an KILL signal ?

Yes, that is what Apache does.  If you require a script
that can run for longer after the client disconnects you need
to fork a child process and have it do the work.

 Apache 1.2 didn=B4t do that ... this version only sent a PIPE-signal.
 I wanted to upgrade to 1.3 but this would mean I have to change all my
 CGI-Scripts ... (many of my scripts require going on after
 disconnection)
 So I think the only way without changing my scripts is to change the
 source-code of Apache ... ?
