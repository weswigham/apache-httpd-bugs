First off all i want to thank you very much :)
I dont know id this means anything to you guys & gals, but i just thought i would like to put in some mental support :)

We are very busy here at http://www.pc-cafe.com and we really cant have our webserver going down. Burt nevertheless that happened and when i restored it the webserver part was down. I installed your Server and i didnt even have to do ANYTHING, our page was again available..

  The kindest Regards.
