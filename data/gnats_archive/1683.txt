>Description:
If a cgi script generates a "Connection: close" header then the header
returned by Apache will be "Connection: close, close". This shouldn't
break any clients, but you never know...
>How-To-Repeat:
The following cgi script will do it:

---------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh -f
 
echo "Connection: close"
echo ""
 
echo "... That's all folks ..."
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can try it at http://www.innovation.ch/cgi-bin/close_con
>Fix:
The set_keepalive() function correctly notices that a "Connection: close"
is there (-> wimpy is true), but it then adds the "close" token anyway.
Here's the patch:
