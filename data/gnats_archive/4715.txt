OS: RedHat Linux 5.1  (2.0.35 Kernel)
SYSTEM: i486
COMPILER: GCC
RAM: Plenty
>Description:
I'm running 1.3.6 and I have some forms on my Internet website. When I click
submit (or whatever it may be), nothing happens, (the browser contacts the server and just says waiting for reply.)
Occasionaly, if you click STOP and submit about 5 or six times, then you will get the response from PERL.
Running PERL sctipts from a BASH prompt works fine (and fast!). C/C++ CGI Scripts
and SHELL scripts do not give me any type of problem. This problem however is ot the cause of a script,
because it has been doing this on many.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can try using my feedback form http://www.e-bizinternet.com/Contact_Us/contact_us.html
I dont care how many times you use it.. go ahead and be my guest because i really want this to be solved.
(This form (script) does work and has been tested.)
>Fix:
No idea.

 Oh, I forgot to mention, that nothing shows up in the  error_log ... the
 browser times out before apache even tries to do anything.

 I figured out that apache perl scripts work wine with SSI and just typing
 the url in the web browser. This leaves me to believe it is a POST problem.
