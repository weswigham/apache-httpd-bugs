>Description:
When in a directory protected by .htaccess password protection going to a cgi via `http://blah/cgi-bin/blah.cgi` $ENV{'REMOTE_USER'} is returned correctly, but using <form method="POST" action="blah.cgi" ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data"> $ENV{'REMOTE_USER'} doesn't return anything.
>How-To-Repeat:
/cgi-bin/protected/.htaccess
 AuthType Basic
 AuthName "Protected Pages"
 AuthUserFile /.htpasswd
 <LIMIT GET>
 require valid-user
 </LIMIT>

/cgi-bin/protected/blah.cgi
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
 $currentuser = $ENV{'REMOTE_USER'};
 if ($currentuser eq "") {
  print "Where did your user name go?";
 } else {
  print "your user name is: $currentuser";
 }

/formfile.html
 <html><body><form method="POST" action="cgi-bin/blah.cgi" ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data">
 <input type="text" name="blah"><br>
 <input type="submit" value="Send">
 </form>
 </body></html>


say you use the user name foo in /.htpasswd
access http://blah/cgi-bin/protected/blah.cgi
you should get 'your user name is: foo'
but using /html/formfile.html
you should get 'Where did your user name go?'

 You are not POSTing to a CGI that is in the protected directory!
 So of course it won't have a username show up.

State-Changed-Why:

Well, you are limiting authentication to GET requests, but
you're using "POST" for your form.
Just remove <Limit GET>.
