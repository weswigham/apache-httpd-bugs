Server-Linux
Client-Windows 98 (running IE)
>Description:
Internet Explorer sends both the language and the country-code as part of it's "Accept-Languages" field (ie: en-us or fr-ca).  Content Negotation (mod_negotation) is unable to interpret the country code and always chooses the default language (making content negotiation for languages useless under Internet Explorer)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create two files:
hi.html.en
hi.html.fr
Set internet explorers default language (Tools->Internet Options->Languages) to French (any country).
Notice that when you try to access "hi.html" from IE ONLY the english version hi.html) will load.  The other "versions" will not load no matter what you type (unless you explicitly type hi.html.fr)
If you explicitly add the language (ie: AddLanguage fr-ca .fr) to the Apache configuration file, it works, but short of manually AddLanguage for EVERY single permutation of Languages and countries in IE, there is no workaround
>Fix:
Implement a workaround (BrowserMatch?) to strip off the "country code" from the languages IE ouputs.
Or have mod_negiotiation.c strip it off automatically if it detects the "country code".

State-Changed-Why:

First, that's not a country code, that's a sub-language
identifier.  In some language families, a given sub-language
may prove difficult to read for users in another sub-lang,
which is why they are different in the first place.

We are introducing new features into Apache 2.0 to address
this issue.  Negotiation is an incredibly dicey proposition
when you combine webmasters authoring filenames with some
other administrator configuring the server, and users
requests arriving every which way.

I don't expect to backport the new configuration options
to the 1.3 family, but look at 2.0.28 (not 2.0.27, which
may be announced next week) when it's announced about a
month from now.  It will offer several levels of granularity
in choosing content to serve.

I'll suspend your report till the patch to resolve these
problems has been committed.
