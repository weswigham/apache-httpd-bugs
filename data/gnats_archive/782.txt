>Description:
the 1.2.0 does not answer any requests anymore when there are over 124 
<virtualhost> entries. 1.2b8 just dies with a SIGBUS.

MAXUSERS is set to 256, the whole system is pretty unlimited. 
i tried kern.somaxconn with values over 256, no change in behaviour.

seems pretty much like we're running into a freebsd bug here

State-Changed-Why:
There are MANY existing PRs in the database about the
same thing and there is an entry in the FAQ about it at
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#fdlim
Please read it.  Note that there is a bug in FreeBSD
libraries that prevents using high numbered file descriptors
for certain things.  When Apache 1.2.1 is released, it should
include a change to work around the broken libraries.
