>Environment:
Linux-2.2.13ac1, egcs-1.1.2, binutils-2.9.5.0.16, apache_1.3.9 + php-4.0b2
>Description:
With netscape closed, "netstat -an" and "lsof -n -i -P | grep 80" shows nothing.
I have also had the problem with Linux-2.2.23-pre kernels. My other machine
has the same setup kernel-wise, no php and binutils-2.9.1.0.25, on this
httpd does not start at bootup, you have to start it manually, but it runs.
Server version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix)
Server built:   Oct 16 1999 10:33:40
Server's Module Magic Number: 19990320:6
Server compiled with....
 -D HAVE_MMAP
 -D HAVE_SHMGET
 -D USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD
 -D USE_MMAP_FILES
 -D USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 -D HTTPD_ROOT="/usr/local/apache"
 -D SUEXEC_BIN="/usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec"
 -D DEFAULT_PIDLOG="logs/httpd.pid"
 -D DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD="logs/apache_runtime_status"
 -D DEFAULT_LOCKFILE="logs/accept.lock"
 -D DEFAULT_XFERLOG="logs/access_log"
 -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG="logs/error_log"
 -D TYPES_CONFIG_FILE="conf/mime.types"
 -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="conf/httpd.conf"
 -D ACCESS_CONFIG_FILE="conf/access.conf"
 -D RESOURCE_CONFIG_FILE="conf/srm.conf"
>How-To-Repeat:
apachectl start causes the problem to be reported in err_log. Using 
Netscape-4.08, lsof -n -i -P shows netscape is using port 80 happily and 
httpd not running.
