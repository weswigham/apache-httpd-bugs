any
>Description:
if you access a URL like:
ftp://ftpserver.ftp.server/dir1/dir2/dir3/file1
and the ftp-server is configured to push you somewhere in the hierarchy
(maybe /dir1/dir2/dir3)
the proxy module tries a 
cd dir1
cd dir2
cd dir3

these requests will fail because we are already in dir3
.
>How-To-Repeat:
sorry, because the only example i know is a URL with user and password.
the given patch works as described.
>Fix:
so here i got a quick modification of the source-code
by sending a "CWD /" at the beginning of the ftp session.

 The current code is done the way it is on purpose; it follows RFC 1738.
 
 That said, RFC 1738 is broken and the entire directory handling code of
 the proxy_ftp.c should be rewritten, so that what you describe works among
 many other things.
 
 Sigh.  Since it may be a looooooong time before the proxy is fixed
 properly, we will consider the impact of a workaround as you describe.
 
 Thanks.

 I've read the corresponding section "3.2.2", which describes the proposed
 behaviour.So what i can say is, that the mod_proxy is basically designed to
 retrieve
 the files conform to the RFC.
 The problem i've reported showed up by updating a virus scanner for
 the DOS/Windows Environment, the software allows you to specify a proxy and
 then it tried to get a URL similar to those described in the problem.
 But the URL they specify will get only a relative path according to RFC 1738.
 
 So my quick hack is only a workaround to this problem, but maybe a lot of
 other users will face the same problem if the try to update their virus
 scanners.
 Maybe these company should change their used URL, but maybe it's compiled
 into the
 product :-( and they are not willingly to change anything.

 It is possible that we can use URL-rewriting for some locations, maybe the
 best idea,
 i tried it for this special case and it works.
 
 Here comes the recipe:
 1. you need mod_rewrite
 2. add those lines and modify them corresponding to your needs
 
 <Directory proxy:ftp://*@<some ftp-host>/*>
 RewriteEngine on
 RewriteRule ^(proxy:ftp://.*@<some ftp-host>/)(.*) $1%2F$2
 </Directory>
 
 This will put the "%2F" character between host-part and url-path.
 maybe the pattern should be specified more precisely, if somebody uses a @ in
 
 a url-path and no user/password is given in the url and the hostname also
 appears in the url-path.
 
 I think we can close this item, sorry for bothering you.
 
 Thanks
