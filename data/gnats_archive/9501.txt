 and Lecturers for Coaching, effective as of Jan. 1, 
 2002. 
     DiCicco, who compiled 103-8-8 record as head 
 coach of the USA from 1994-1999, lead the USA to the 
 1996 Olympic gold medal and the 1999 Women's World 
 Cup championship.  He also coached the USA to a third-
 place finish at 1995 Women's World Cup. 
     Among his responsibilities on the prestigious FIFA 
 Panel, DiCicco will be in involved in supplying direction

 coaching and assist in the direction of the women's 
 game.  It's been a wonderful last 11 years and I've 
 seen the dramatic evolution of the women's game since 
 the 1991 Women's World Cup.  The greatest growth is 
 still ahead of us and I am honored to be a part of that."
