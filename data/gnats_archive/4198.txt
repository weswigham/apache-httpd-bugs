This is in regards to PR number 3507.

  http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/3507

I believe the problem that many people are seeing with respect to 
mod_auth_dbm not working in Apache, especially under Solaris, is the
fact that NDBM under Solaris 2.x is *not* "MT-Safe" or "MT-Level Unsafe"
(according to its man page).  I believe this is what is causing many
people problems when they try to use NDBM on their native OS.

To test this theory, I modified mod_auth_dbm.c to *create* a DBM file at
the same time it tries to open another one.  (See included patch below.)
In theory if DBM is working, a normal, readable DBM file will be
created.

The result under Solaris 2.5 is two files (/tmp/apache.dir and
/tmp/apache.pag) that appear to contain complete garbage.  I even got a
core dump from dbmmanage (hence perl) when trying to read the files!

# ls -la /tmp/apache.*
-rw-r--r--   2 httpd    httpd      12295 Apr  5 20:12 /tmp/apache.dir
-rw-r--r--   2 httpd    httpd      12295 Apr  5 20:12 /tmp/apache.pag

This indicates to me that mod_auth_dbm is severely broken, at least on
Solaris, for current versions of Apache.  (Have you done any regression
testing lately?)

I'm not sure if Berkeley DB or GDBM are any better at handling this, but
it seems like quite a severe problem to me.
