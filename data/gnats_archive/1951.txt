>Description:
A Scriptalias on / to [cgidir]/blah.pl 
directs to [cgidir]/blah.plABC when trying to access 
http://host/ABC/ which can't be found as it doesn't exist...

ScriptAlias / /home/httpd/cgi-bin/lincows/makepage.pl
http://localhost/ works and redirects to /home/httpd/cgi-bin/lincows/makepage.pl
http://localhost/ABC/ redirects to /home/httpd/cgi-bin/lincows/makepage.plABC
>How-To-Repeat:
ScriptAlias / /home/httpd/cgi-bin/lincows/makepage.pl
http://localhost/ works and redirects to /home/httpd/cgi-bin/lincows/makepage.pl
http://localhost/ABC/ redirects to /home/httpd/cgi-bin/lincows/makepage.plABC
>Fix:
not really... i don't know anything about Apache's source... but it shouldn't
be too hard to remove the subdirectory's name after the cgi path..

State-Changed-Why:
That is the way it is supposed to work and is the
way it is documented.

ScriptAlias is not designed to redirect an entire directory
to a single URL.

In the 1.3 code, ScriptAliasMatch can be used to do what
you want.  If you add mod_rewrite to your server it can do
it, or changing your ScriptAlias to:

  ScriptAlias / /home/httpd/cgi-bin/lincows/makepage.pl/

should make it work for what you need.  The info on the
real path requested below / will be in PATH_INFO.
