Redhat 2.0.18
compiled with gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
I upgraded from redhat 1.2.13 to 2.0.18.  Upon upgrading I have been receiving
 httpd: caught SIGSEGV, dumping core in my error log when I hit a page with a
#exec cmd directive.  #exec cgi directives work fine, but I need to pass
arguments so it doesn't solve my problem at hand.  My #exec cmd programs are
written in perl 5.003, but I tried a simple ksh script also and apache dumped
core.

I tend to believe that this is a linux version bug, but I figured I would submit
a bug report here just in case anyone encounters a similar problem (and finds a
solution?).
>How-To-Repeat:
Aside from logging into my machine and poking around I am not sure how you can
repeat the problem.
>Fix:
no

State-Changed-Why:
If you are using the version supplied with RedHat, try
downloading 1.1.3 from http://www.apache.org/ and installing
that.  If that does not work, try 1.2b6 to see if it is
fixed.  If that fails, send me a copy of your config 
files and a sample SSI that is causing problems.

Probably cleaned up in the 1.2b9 fixes to cgi argument
handling.
