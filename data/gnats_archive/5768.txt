SunOS sirius 5.5.1 Generic_103640-24 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60
gcc version 2.8.1, GNU ld
libstc++ 2.8.1.1
The problem might appear on other GNU based systems too
>Description:
The name 'alloc.h' is used in the GNU STL implemenation.
>How-To-Repeat:
installing apache, then try to compile code that uses some header from
the same dir as the header of the Apache API
>Fix:
rename 'alloc.h' to 'ap_alloc.h', especially since the pool allocation
scheme implementation is fairly Apache specific
