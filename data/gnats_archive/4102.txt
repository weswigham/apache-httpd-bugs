JDK 1.2. JSDK 2.0
>Description:
I am attempting to call log() in an init function.  This actually results 
in a call to getServerContext().log().  Apparently the ServerContext is 
null during init, thereby causing the exception.

I don't know if this is the expected behaviour, but it seems odd.
>How-To-Repeat:
Call log() from within a servlets init routine.
>Fix:
Initialize a servlet context object before calling init on a servlet?
