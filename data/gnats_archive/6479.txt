>Description:
If a ServletException is thrown inside the init() method, then the output
of the exception is not logged anywhere at all.
This makes it very difficult to debug startup problems.
A very fundamental flaw that needs to be fixed urgently.
>How-To-Repeat:
in init():
throw new ServletException("Please log this somewhere")
>Fix:
On application level, a possible workaround may contain this:
config.getServletContext().log(ex, this.getClass().getName()
//where
//"config" is the config parameter of the init() method
//"this" is the servlet instance
//"ex" is a ServletException

As I said it is on application level and really only demonstrates
what kind of output would be expected in the log.

    Found an appropriate place to put a quick hack (JServServletManager
 - >
 loadStartupServlets) as folllows:
 
    Original
    =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
     private void loadStartupServlets(JServSendError se) {
         if (startups =3D=3D null) {
             return;
         }
 
         for(int i =3D 0; i < startups.length; i++) {
             String servname =3D startups[i];
 
             if (servname =3D=3D null) {
                 continue;
             }
 
             try {
                 loadServlet(servname, se);
             } catch (ServletException initError) {
                 se.sendError(initError);                      <----
 this guy was
 doing nothing
             }
         }
     }
 
    Hack
    =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
     private void loadStartupServlets(JServSendError se) {
         if (startups =3D=3D null) {
             return;
         }
 
         for(int i =3D 0; i < startups.length; i++) {
             String servname =3D startups[i];
 
             if (servname =3D=3D null) {
                 continue;
             }
 
             try {
                 loadServlet(servname, se);
             } catch (ServletException initError) {
                 JServ.log.log(CH_SERVLET_EXCEPTION,
 "(loadStartupServlets)
 initialization failed for servlet: '"
                     + servname + "'; initError.getMessage()=3D" +
 initError.getMessage());
                 se.sendError(initError); // leave him in for now...
             }
         }
     }
