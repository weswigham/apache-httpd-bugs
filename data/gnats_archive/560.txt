IRIX 6.2
>Description:
When I try to kill off or reconfigure the server using 'killall httpd' or 
'killall -HUP httpd', some server processes don't die.  Even a kill -9
won't kill them.  The biggest problem is that they hang on to port 80 so I
can't start another server.  Seems only a reboot will resolve the problem.

Try killing the server under irix 6.2

 Try doing it the proper way, ie. 
 
 	kill -HUP `cat /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/httpd.pid`
 
 or
 
 	kill -HUP 666
 
 where 666 is the process of the parent.  Don't send a signal to all
 the children, there is no reason.
