>Environment:
Windows 95
>Description:
Afer downloading the binary file from ftp site, I installed the Apache for Win 95.
I assumed there was no need to change any parameters in httpd.conf file as I was 
running in the standalone mode. I started from Start menu the Apache console came
alive but I could not type any command there. Later I completely uninstalled it and
re-installed the software. Now when I start it the Console comes up but dies immediately.
If needed I can e-mail my httpd.conf and other files, but basically these are 
default ones.
>How-To-Repeat:
It can be repeated on any Win 95 PC.
>Fix:
Examine the httpd.conf files

State-Changed-Why:
As requested before you submit a bug report, please ask for
help on Usenet before submitting if you are not sure it is
a bug you are submitting.

In this case, it is almost certainly not a bug.  You are not
supposed to be able to "type any commands" into the Apache
server while it is running.  In the second case, you need
to run it by hand from a shell to see what it is doing and
why it does; if it doesn't print anything out directly, then
there may be something in the error log.
