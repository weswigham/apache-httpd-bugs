>Description:
I am attempting to use the Include directive to read in a file from a location outside the Apache install directory.  The error seems to be cause by apache not allowing files to be outside its install path.  Here is the error I get:

[Fri Dec 22 10:52:10 2000] [error] Access to config file c:/program files/apache/c:\program files/tomcat/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto denied: not a valid filename
fopen: Permission denied
Apache.exe: could not open document config file c:/program files/apache/c:\progr
am files/tomcat/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto

As you can see it's prepending it's install directory in front of the absolute path I gave.  If I try relative paths it will not interrupt them, for example

[Fri Dec 22 10:54:38 2000] [error] Access to config file c:/program files/apache/../tomcat/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto denied: not a valid filename
fopen: Permission denied
Apache.exe: could not open document config file c:/program files/apache/../tomcat/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto

I noted that it keeps saying the fopen is denied, however I have tried running apache in both administrative level access in system leve access and get the same results.
>How-To-Repeat:
I produce the mod_jk HOWTO included with Tomcat 3.2.1, presummably if those directions are followed on any windows 2000 (perhaps Windows machines in general) you would get the same results.

State-Changed-Why:
You can't use backslashes in .conf file pathnames.  You
must always use forward slashes for a number of reasons.
1.3.20 solves this problem (somewhat) but you may still
encounter problems trying it (in some cases, the backslash
character is an escape, so "c:\" is c:"  with that literal
quote that's been escaped!

Just use slashes.
