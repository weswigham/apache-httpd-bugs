>Environment:
Windows Nt 4.0 SP3, binary release from apache.org
>Description:
I have installed the Win NT release 1.3b6 on my local machine. I´d like to give 
access to some directories only to certain users. But the server sends only the 
message that there is no access to the directory. There is no box for entering
the username and password. The configuration is like the example. On Win NT 
the password in the user-file is not encrypted.
