>Release:        1.3.2 win32
>Environment:
Apache pre-compiled version 1.3.2 win32 in standard directory
O.S. win95 OSR2, clean installation
>Description:
output of command:
C:\Programmi\Apache>apache
Syntax error on line 30 of C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE/modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll into server:
end of output

NOTE: there is no a syntax error: httpd.conf load ALL other modules with
the same syntax. File ApacheModuleProxy.dll really exists in directory
C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE/modules
>How-To-Repeat:
Install apache_1_3_2_win32.exe, configure conf files with:
LoadModule proxy_module modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll
ProxyRequests on

and exec the server in window shell.
>Fix:
debugging?

State-Changed-When: Mon Oct  5 16:01:11 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is a known problem and there are multiple reports
about it.  There is something in Win95 that prevents the
proxy module from loading properly; it works fine on NT
and 98.  Exactly what is unknown at this time.
