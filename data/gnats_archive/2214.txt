State-Changed-Why:
Exactly what message is shown in the error log?

Exactly what directives are you using to try to limit
access?

Are you sure the htpasswd file and all directories above
it are world readable?

 Here are the files in question:
 
 .htaccess
 
 
 AuthUserFile /usr/home/actionpak/html/family/.htpasswd
 AuthGroupFile /dev/null
 AuthName Name
 AuthType Basic
 <Limit GET>
 require user psapiano
 </Limit> 
 
 
 .htgroup
 
 
 insiders:  psapiano@nl2k.ab.ca
 
 
 and the .htpasswd
 
 is as expected.
 
 
 Any pointers?

 Don't use a Limit GET directive unless you really mean to only limit GET.

 Huh?  What does a htgroup file have to do with it?  And why are you using
 @nl2k.ab.ca?

 What do you mean "as expected"?
 
 You aren't trying to put in psapiano@nl2k.ab.ca are you?
 
 Again, _exactly_ what error message are you getting in the error log?
