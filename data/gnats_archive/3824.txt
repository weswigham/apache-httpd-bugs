>Description:
Document is returned with status 500 regardless 
ErrorDocument 500 http://example.com/x.html directive in configuration file
if some document is blocked.

If I try to supply my own document for case when some site is blocked, user
document with link to my document instead of directly moved to my document.
>How-To-Repeat:
put into config:

ErrorDocument 500 http://example.com/x.html
ProxyBlock block.org

Try to get document from block.org site. You will get:
500 Proxy Error
Location: http://example.com/x.html

<Document with link to http://example.com>

Instead of 
302 Found
Location: http://example.com/x.html

<Document with link to http://example.com/x.html>
>Fix:
remove line with status_line = "500 Proxy Error" from proxy_util.c
THere might be reason to remove lines with status_line = "200 Ok" from proxy*.c
Or change part of apache core that failed to ensure corect status line will be
put into answer to client.
