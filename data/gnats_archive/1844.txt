>Description:
I have one IP address, and I run one virtual host using NameVirtualHost.
If I just have one <VirtualHost..> section, for the single virtual host,
the web server always interprets every incoming request as for the virtual host.
It should default to the main server document root unless the host name
requested was the virtual host.
I worked around the problem by adding a <VirtualHost..> entry for the
actual hostname.  The documents did not mention having to do this, so either 
there is a bug or the document did not include enough information.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Fix NameVirtualHost to not treat every incoming request to the system's only IP
as a virtual host.  Or, alter the documentation to make note of this limitation.

 It's not a limitation, it's documented to behave exactly this way.  The
 vhosts/details.html docs say this:
 
     The first vhost on this list (the first vhost that appears after the
     corresponding NameVirtualHost directive in the config file) has the
     highest priority and catches any request to an unknown server name
     or a request without a Host: header.
 
 So it will never serve your "main server" config.  You need to encapsulate your main
 server as the first <VirtualHost> for your IP.

User error.  I whacked the documentation anyhow so that it states
this stuff in bold in two additional places.
