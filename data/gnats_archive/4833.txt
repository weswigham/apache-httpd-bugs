Hello.

I have tried to locate a site contaning information on using
.htaccess under win32 . 

I have not yet found out howto password protect sites, i have
mangaed to get the box where you fill in the username andre password
but not how to set password and users.

Hopefully, you have a page or something.

Best Regards.
