State-Changed-Why:

You should be able to do what you want right now using #include virtual,
provided you're also not using PATH_INFO on the html files that have the

Regarding changing the other behaviours... yep every time we change it
someone's scripts break.  So we're definately not going to touch it right
now because we're just trying to get 1.2 finished.
