ApacheJServ-1.1.2 j2sdk-1.3.0-RC1-linux-i386 apache 1.3.14 jsdk20-solaris2-sparc

after ./configure, make and make install of all the above, I cannot view jserv test page. I have had no problem instaling and configuring prev. versions of apache w/ jserv. I have friends at other companys that are having the same problem. I have been told this is a documented bug at this point. I AM WRITING THIS TO VIEW THE KNON PROBLEM. I do not know if it is the apache version or jserv version or what. please let me know where the known problem page is at.
