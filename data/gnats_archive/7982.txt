>Release:        1.3.20 (Win32 MSI package)
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 (w/Service pack 6) [ Running MS Exchange in background ] - downloaded the binary MSI package of Apache 1.3.20 (without source code)
>Description:
I installed version 1.1 of Windows installer on the server successfully and restarted.  I ran Apache setup and everything seemed ok until it was about to copy files where setup was "interrupted".  I didn't press cancel or anything!  I tried installing it while logged in as a domain administrator (this is the first time i've had problems with a software installation while logged in as this).  I then tried installing Windows Installer 1.2 (successfully again) and setup still quits out just before files are about to be copied.  I then downloaded a previous version of Apache (a version which doesn't use the windows installer), version 1.3.6 and that now is running fine.
