>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional Service Pack 2
>Description:
My w2k platform's default locale is US English and hebrew is defined as a secondary language for input, When Hebrew is added to IE 6.0 in addition to English from Tools -> Internet Options -> Languages(button on the general tab). The default Apache page after new installation is displayed in Hebrew rather than English. With every other language, it doesn't occur, I tried Hindi, Arabic.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow the steps above with IE 6.0 with a new installation of apache.
>Fix:
Remove hebrew from IE 6.0 Languages. (but hebew is needed for hebrew based sites that I need to access)

State-Changed-Why:
I'm laying dollars to donuts this is your configuration
error; here's why.

You have requested en-us and he.  Now Apache doesn't know
en-us, although it knows en and he.  But you were pretty
specific, you wanted en-us.  Apache assigns en a _very_
low priority because it happens to be the base of en-us,
but he ends up with a much higher priority.

I expect you meant to set up your languages as
en-us
en
en-gb [or others that might commonly occur]
he

Give that a try.
