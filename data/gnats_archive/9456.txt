>Description:
I'm using mod_rewrite to proxy requests to a remote server.  If I
proxy a request for /my_file.txt, everything works OK.  But, proxied
requests for /my_file.cgi fail.

Why?  I followed the request for /file.cgi after it went through
mod_rewrite.  After mod_rewrite was done, r->handler was
"proxy-server", the way it should be.  Then, came a call to
ap_find_types() in http_request.c:


    if (! (r->proxyreq != NOT_PROXY
           && r->parsed_uri.scheme != NULL
           && strcmp(r->parsed_uri.scheme, "http") == 0) ) {
        if ((access_status = ap_find_types(r)) != 0) {
            decl_die(access_status, "find types", r);
            return;
        }
    }

After the request went through mod_mime's find_ct(), r->handler was
set to "perl-script". Wrong!  I think that no module should be able to
change the handler if the request is proxied.

<my system>

    apache_1.3.22
    mod_perl-1.26
    mod_ssl-2.8.5-1.3.22
    redhat-7.1
    linux-2.4.3-12

<snippets from my http.conf>

    ProxyRequests On

    PerlPassEnv PERL5LIB
    PerlInitHandler Apache::StatINC
    <Files ~ "\.(pl|cgi)$">
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlHandler Apache::Registry
      Options ExecCGI
    </Files>

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule "^/redirect/(.*)" "http://proxy.com/$1" [P]
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a config with mod_rewrite proxying requets, and try to fetch anything.cgi
>Fix:
a) skip the call to ap_find_types in http_request.c if r->proxyreq != NOT_PROXY

b) fix mod_mime to ignore proxy requests
