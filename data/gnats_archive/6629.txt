>Description:
Given:

User nobody
Group Nobody
...
<Virtualhost ...>
User bob
Group marley
ScriptAlias /home/bobo/cgi-bin
...
</VirtualHost>

/home/bob/cgi-bin must be at least 705
(assuming nobody is not in marley, if so then 750)

Suexec does not get invoked and the setuid/setgid is not run
before the enetering the directory...
It seems howver, that if the purpose of suexec is to make CGI act exactly
as if the user were at the command line, it should setuid/setgid *before*
descending into the directory...

This way user's could have a more secure 700 mode for there cgi-bin
(yes, it just prevent's reading... but o+rx still seems a bad requirement...)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
setuid/setgid before chdir/execing the CGI
(or determing that it's there even)

State-Changed-Why:

The idea behind suexec is to complete ALL the 
security checks BEFORE allowing the
suid process to go ahead.  That way, any error
would result in no extra permissions being
granted.

For this reason, suexec must be able to access
the file under its original permissions.

Thanks for using Apache.
