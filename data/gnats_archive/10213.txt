Comment-Added:
Which awk.exe are you invoking?

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/win_compiling.html has a reference
to a very stable awk.exe [awk95.exe, but you need to rename it]
that absolutely no Win32 developer associated with the Apache
project has had any problems with.

You also need to be sure that it's in the list of Options
 - Directories - Executable Files.

Please let us know if a different awk.exe causes the same
problem, and if so, which versions you were attempting to
use.
