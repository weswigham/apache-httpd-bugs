Apache on Linux (RedHat). Client usually Netscape 4.05. 
>Description:
This sound like the bug reported in the README and FAQ but all attempts to use the 
workarounds recommended have failed. Post to dejanews went unanswered.

I have a strange problem using Apache 1.2.6 on Linux. I have an applet
(JDK1.02) that is started from the server. Once the applet starts in the browser (usually Netscaep 4.05)it
contacts the server using a URLConnection to fetch a
binary file (a CAD drawing). This usually works fine.
In some cases (seems like Netscape 4.05 mostly) the applet gets an
IOException of "server status 206" or "server status 200" in the middle
of reading the file. The log file shows a '200' result but the file size
is too small.
This problem happens infrequently, i.e. the same browser may work a
couple of times then fail.

I set the "BrowserMatch" to force http1.0 response and am at a loss.
The log file shows a request using HTTP/1.0 and the response when
Mozilla is the user agent is HTTP/1.0

The attempts at workaround are as follows:

BrowserMatch Java1.0 force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch JDK/1.0 force-respons-1.0
#BrowserMatch * force_response-1.0
BrowserMatch Mozilla force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch Java force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "^Java" force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "^Mozilla" force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "^JDK" force-response-1.0
BrowserMatchNoCase mozilla downgrade-1.0
BrowserMatchNoCase jdk downgrade-1.0
BrowserMatchNoCase java downgrade-1.0       

The last 3 lines have been added recently.

I suspect it's the "region" bug. Is there a way to disable partial returns via the server?

I have also seen this problem when the browser tries to load the archive containing the Java applet,
i.e. event before the applet starts. It fails to load the archive with "server status 206" then loads the classes one at a time.
>How-To-Repeat:
It's hard to repeat. It happens infrequently. a sample URL is http://www.viewcad.com/demo/0.html
It may happen more often if partial content is in the browser cache. i.e. stop the browser mid way through loading the drawing,
then reload. 
>Fix:
Disable the "Region" response? i.e. have a switch to allways return the full contents?

Thanks for the help.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you please try using a current version of Apache.  As
we clearly state before you submit a PR, we can't support
ancient versions.

I would also suggest that this is likely a bug in the client
that needs to be worked around in the client... there isn't
too much we can necessarily do about that.

 Hi Marc,
 
 I read that you don't support older versions. There are no notes about a fix in the 1.3 version for this
 problem.
 We did not want to spend the time upgrading since 1.3 is different than 1.2 in many respects, unless there was a
 fix.
 There is talk in the FAQ about a Java bug that can be fixed with the "force-response-1.0", this does not seem to
 solve the problem in this case.
 I do think a work around can be to set the server to a HTTP/1.0 server since 1.0 did not include the Range
 header (correct?) or response 206.
 
 Is this possible?
 
 Thanks
 
 Ariel
