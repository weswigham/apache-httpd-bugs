>Description:
In the win32 version of open.c the function ap_open_stderr has the following code:

    (*thefile) = ap_pcalloc(cont, sizeof(struct file_t *));
    if ((*thefile) == NULL) {
        return APR_ENOMEM;
    }
    memset(*thefile, '\0', sizeof(struct file_t));

Since the call to ap_pcalloc uses sizeof file_t * but the memset call uses sizeof file_t there is a mismatch that causes a memory overwrite. It seems apparent that the intention is to use sizeof file_t in both cases.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to startup Apache on Win32 without defining the key SOFTWARE\Apache Software Foundation\Apache\2.0.
>Fix:
Use sizeof(struct file_t) in allocation statement.

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for your bug report.  I removed the memset call,
because we are using ap_pcalloc, the memset to set everything
to \0 is redundant.
