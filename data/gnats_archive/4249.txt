Oeprating System: Windows NT4
>Description:
The apache will not work if no user log in into the server. 

Unlike IIS that will work even if the no user logged into the server, apache needs some one to log in to the web server.
If the user logged out, the apache service will not work.
This migh not be good for security, especially when the admin is nowhere close to the server.
However, the counter to the problem is that the user can just log into the server and then lock the server.
But it's kinda annoying though.

>How-To-Repeat:
Try to install Apache in NT server. Then log out from the server and call the apache from other computer's browser.
The status window's message in the browser will say that "the server is contacted and waiting for reply".
However, the process will return nothing.

Now try to log in to the server and try to call apache web server site again from the same browser, it will work.
If you lock your NT, it will still work though.

Hope this report means something.
>Fix:
So far the way to counter is to have an authorized user to login to the NT web server machine and then lock the machine.

State-Changed-Why:

Which NT service pack, and as what user are you starting the
Apache service (in the Control Panel Services Apache Startup
options)?

This should no longer be a problem.
