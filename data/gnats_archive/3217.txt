Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.7.2.3/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.3

i installed bind 8.1.2 but i don't think it touches my resolver libs.

observe that there are no "invalid argument" errors for non-round-robin hosts.
>How-To-Repeat:
it happens intermittently.  ask the proxy for any url whose host has multiple a records.
keep trying with different hosts until you get "invalid argument" in error_log.
hit reload and this time you'll usually get through.
>Fix:
i regret not fully specifying the bug but i haven't had the chance to get into the C code yet.
this happens with 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3.

 the apache was compiled after the bind upgrade.  the bind
 upgrade should be irrelevant to this problem, come to think
 of it, because the resolver libraries weren't affected; i
 have commented out the localhost nameserver from resolv.conf
 and the problem is still happening, so i'm pretty sure the
 error doesn't have anything to do with the bind upgrade.
