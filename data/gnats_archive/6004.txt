>Description:
Hello:

The problem is: I can not generate apache with php module.
the steps are:

1.- cd /usr/apache/apache_1.3.9
2.- ./configure --prefix=/usr/apacheII
3.- cd /usr/php/php-3.0.16
4.- ./configure --with-apache=/usr/apache/apache_1.3.9
5.- make
6.- make install

After this steps I can not find the apache directories in the /usr/apacheII, I found nothing.
During the make (5.-)comand it appears the warnings:

 Hello Marc:
 I can generate the apache directories and the web server works
 correctly, but now I'm not be
 able to execute php scripts!!.
 I read the install documentation in the web you recommended but I can
 find another step more.
 Do I forget anything more to do?
 Can I check any log file?
 Can I perform any test?
 Thank you in advance
 Javier Gutierrez
