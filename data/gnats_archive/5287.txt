>Description:
Using APACI, apache builds with the HSREGEX library. The library seems to
have problems on this platform which the system regex library does not. To 
compile without the HSREGEX library I needed to edit Configuration.tmpl and
changed 'Rule WANTHSREGEX' to 'no'.
>How-To-Repeat:
On an alpha/DU4, try 'make r' in the src/regex directory to perform a 
regression test. I get 12 regexec failures. I did not see a problem in 
apache itself, but I did have problems with some RE stuff in PHP when it
was loaded as an apache module. I tried building php with the system regex, 
but it still seems to use the one in apache.
>Fix:
Probably need further testing of system regex, but the HS library definately 
looks broken.
