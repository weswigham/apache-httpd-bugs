System 1 is a quad proc Xeon with raid, oodles of memory, etc.
System 2 is a dual proc pentium classic 
>Description:
I tried to create a htpasswd file, but the binary segfaults once the password is entered.  It leaves this in the error_log:
[Sun May 27 23:53:52 2001] [notice] child pid 2069 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
Ive reproduced the problem on two different smp slackware 7.1 boxes running kernel 2.2.19 with apache 1.3.19 and 1.3.20.
>How-To-Repeat:
i think any slack 7.1 system (full install), perhaps multiprocessor will also have the same problem.
>Fix:
could it be a library dependancy that slackware doesnt have or the way the password is encrypted?

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu May 31 10:20:24 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This is due to a bug in Slackware that requires all calls to crypt() to use some magic string in the salt.  This completely violates all standards and will cause nearly every non-slackware-specific piece of code to fail.  

You may be able to work around it by installing the DES crypt option to slackware.  If you dislike the completely non-standard way that Slackware works, you should file a bug report with them.
