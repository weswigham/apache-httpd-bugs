>Description:
Trying to run a looking glass script that performs an rsh request to a router.

When the perl script is run from the command line we get complete results, but
when we run the script from the browser we only get the first line of the output
displayed.

Tried setting the KeepAlive value from 15sec to 300sec and Timeout value to
300sec but still get the same result.



>How-To-Repeat:
Its going to be difficult if you dont have a router. But here is a 
cut down version of the script :-

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

$|=1 ;
@data = `/usr/bin/rsh  routername sh ip bgp sum`;
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "<PRE>\nThe array is: ",$#data,"long.\n\n@data\n\n";
foreach $dat (@data){
 print "$dat\n";
}
print "</PRE>\n";

State-Changed-Why:
This is not an issue with the web server, but an issue
with Unix and perl programming.  Various things work differently
under an interactive shell and a non-interactive shell, but
we really don't have the resources to help people with how
to write their CGIs.

 You are not running a "program", you are running a CGI.  There are
 specific requirements for a CGI.
 
 The way things work from an interactive shell versus a non-interactive
 shell, from one user to a different user (ie. the web server), from one
 context to another, etc. varies widely, especially with things like rsh.
 
 It makes no sense to say that the server is closing the child too quickly;
 it does not close it until the script tells it to.
