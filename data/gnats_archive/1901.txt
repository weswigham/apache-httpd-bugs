>Environment:
IRIX 6.2 with gcc
>Description:
Configure decides that i want the -n32 option because i'm on an SGI, even
though i'm using gcc.  gcc for irix doesn't understand -n32 option.  lots of
warnings result.  no harm, but it is kind of annoying...
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
don't put -n32 in the makefile if using gcc on irix
