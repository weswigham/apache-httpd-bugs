>Environment:
windows nt 4.0 service pack 3
>Description:
when an error in a cgi script causes the process to run out of control,
nothing i can do, short of a reboot, will kill the runaway process. if i
try to kill the process via the winnt task manager, i get a "not authorized"
message (i'm running as administrator). even after shutting down apache,
the process lives on in an un-killable state. 
>How-To-Repeat:
write a cgi script (in c) that gets into an error state but doesn't
terminate. then run it on apache 1.3.3 running on nt.
>Fix:
sorry, i'm don't know much about nt. apache must be starting the process
in such a way that it can't be killed by the task manager. perhaps this could
be changed?

State-Changed-Why:
Hello,

Actually, this one is exactly like PR #3168.  The problem
is that you are running Apache as a Service under the
default account (Local System).  Since it is Local System
that started the CGI, no other user is allowed to terminate
the process.  A fix needs to go into Apache to change
the security settings on the started CGI.

As a work around, you can change the "Startup" account
that Apache uses to start under to some account that you
can log on to.  Then, when you need to kill some rogue
CGI processes, you can log on as that user and then should
be able to kill the processes.  I know it's not clean,
but at least it's something. :-)

I'm closing this one since 3168 is prior.

Thanks for using Apache.
