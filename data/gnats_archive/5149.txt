>Environment:
We installed IBM HTTPserver (apache) 1.3.6 on a brandnew Compaq Proliant 800.
OS:Win NT Server4.0 SP4 After installation from the cd and rebooting the system Both IBM HTTP server and IBM HTTP administrator don't want to start. Errormsg:1067 Unexpected Process Termination. We did the typical install, no solution. Full and custom... No result either!
Evert possible SP => No solution! When we install it on another brand of server it works correctly!
