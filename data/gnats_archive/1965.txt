Redhat Linux 2.0.32

perl 5.004_01
>Description:
I am running two intranet servers in the above configuration.  Both of them
exhibit a problem where pressing the 'submit' button on a dynamically generated
form (from a Perl script, method=post) is ignored.  (Browser message
'contacting servername', no response)  This occurs regularly, but
not every time.  I have used different browsers in an attempt to isolate the
problem (Netscape 3, 4.0.4, MSIE) with no difference.  This does not occur on
other sites.

I cannot isolate what triggers this problem.  Suggestions?

State-Changed-Why:
Does anything appear in the error log?  Does the access
appear in the access log?

Can you see your script running while you are waiting?
Are you sure it isn't your script hanging?

 The script is not running when the problem occurs.  Sorry, I should
 have mentioned that.

 Are you using a binary you compiled yourself from the sources download
 directly or are you using a Red Hat RPM or something?  
 
 Try downloading 1.2.5 and compiling it yourself.
 
 Does a connection from the client to the server show up in a netstat on
 the server when it is hanging?
 
 Try disabling keepalives ("KeepAlive" directive).
 
 Try getting a dump of what is happening on the network with tcpdump
 showing the client's connection to the server.
