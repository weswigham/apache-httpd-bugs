>Description:
on the first page on the website, you list apache as having 53% of the webserver
market and site netcraft as the source.  Netcraft reports only 50.35% (which is
still awsome).  Another problem is there is no clear way to report typos on the
website.  Perhaps leaving a webmaster's address lying around would be good..

State-Changed-Why:
If you note carefully, it says "Apache and its derivatives".
Check the platform groupings at netcraft and you will find the
numbers we are talking about.

The proper way to report typos in the web pages is the way
you did it.
