Linux Mandrake 7.2
>Description:
We have a tool bar located on the left side of the page.  It is all done in Flash.
Whenever you go from the home page to another, the home link continues to "wave".
It should be the current page link waving.  We have found that this works on some
platforms, but not others.  I was wondering if this was becuase of an Apache Server
problem?
