[Mon Apr 14 09:50:07 1997] httpd: caught SIGSEGV,
     attempting to dump core in /usr/local/etc/httpd

I'd be happy to provide a core dump, but none exists.
I've set /usr/local/etc/httpd/ to a+rwx, but nothing.

State-Changed-Why:
We cured a segv problem under freebsd later in the betas.  Please
give this a try with 1.2 release (and maybe php 2.0b12).

Thanks for using Apache!
