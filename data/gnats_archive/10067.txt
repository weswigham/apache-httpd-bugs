>Description:
The default config.layout file is missing an "errordir" in de <Layout Debian>-part. The "@(cd $(errordir) && find . -name "CVS" -print | xargs rm -rf {} \;)" line in the Makefile.in now does something very nice (NOT). 
It cd's to your homedir, as ${errordir} is empty, and removes all of the CVS directories in your homedir. This can be *very* annoying. 
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --enable-layout=Debian
>Fix:
Add an $errordir entry for Debian in config.layout.

State-Changed-Why:
I committed a patch to add the errordir entry for Debian
and it will be in the next release. I will fix that
irritating "recursively remove all CVS directories" bug
ASAP. (It has been mentioned before in previous bugs.)

Thanks for using Apache!
