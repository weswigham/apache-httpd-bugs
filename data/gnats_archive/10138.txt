>Description:
In apahce httpd 1.3.x, an access to 'http://localhost/cgi-bin/printenv/' results in an invocation of printenv CGI program.
However, in apache httpd 2.0.32, it seems to result in trying to find a script named 'printenv/' and issues a following error message on the browser.
Premature end of script headers: /opt/httpd-2.0.32/cgi-bin/printenv/
This behaviour is a problem when using 'viewcvs' for example.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/printenv/

Sorry, no idea.

State-Changed-Why:
Hmmm... something weird is happening with your configuration...

cvs.apache.org is running 2.0.32 and this URL works there:
  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/

I get the same correct result for /cgi-bin/printenv and
/cgi-bin/printenv/ using current code from CVS.

Do you have any configuration directives which would affect
printenv?

Please run truss on Apache to see what file is exec()-ed
when you request /cgi-bin/printenv, and whether or not
the exec() succeeded.

I realize you mentioned in your report that it might be trying to run "printenv/" but we need to know for sure.  The truss output should show exactly what Apache tries to exec().

 Thank you for your quick response.
 
 I found the reason of the problem. 'Options FollowSymLinks' directive is the
 one.
 
 I had a following configuration and failed.
 
 <Directory "/opt/httpd-2.0.32/cgi-bin">
     AllowOverride None
     Options FollowSymLinks       # <- reason of the problem
 #    Options None
 
 After I changed back to 'None' option,  an access to 'printenv/' successed.
 
 <Directory "/opt/httpd-2.0.32/cgi-bin">
     AllowOverride None
     Options None       # <- This will work
 
 Is this your expected behaviour?
 
 Anyway I tried to run truss and following is the result grep-ed with
 'printenv'.
 
 27201:  stat("/opt/httpd-2.0.32/cgi-bin/printenv/", 0xFFBEF4E8) = 0
 27203:  chdir("/opt/httpd-2.0.32/cgi-bin/printenv/")    Err#20 ENOTDIR
 
 Httpd didn't exec 'printenv/' as you pointed.
 
 I also put here outputs of 'diff httpd-std.conf httpd.conf' when I got the
 error.
