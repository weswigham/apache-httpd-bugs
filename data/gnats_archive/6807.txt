>Release:        1.3.14
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 95C & NT5
>Description:
1 - My ISAPI DLLs written with MS Visual C++ are no longer working. Only the Borland C++Builder DLLs work properly.
Everything was working with 1.3.12.
2 - "localhost" as server name doesn't seem to work properly. That was working fine with 1.3.12.
When I type "http://localhost" as URL in my browser, Apache doesn't send me the index.htm page as defined by the "Directory index" directive but only an index of the directory (forbidden by rules in the conf file!). There's no problem with "http://127.0.0.1".

So, 1.3.14 is not useful in this state.
Please don't say it is due to a misconfigured server. My httpd.conf is done as it is described in your doc and worked well before.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Modify or remove your "Radical surgery to improve mod_isapi support under Win32"
Idem for "localhost" handling code

State-Changed-When: Mon Dec  3 12:15:14 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Unfortuately, the radical surgury was required to resolve
a long list of open incidents.

The next (post 2.0.29) beta and the current version 1.3.22
should be working correctly.  Please report back with 
additional details of any problem you encounter with the
current version of Apache.

Thanks for the report.
