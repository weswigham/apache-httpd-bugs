>Description:
i have a .shtml that contains some general definitions for my site
----- definitions.shtml  --------
<!--#set var="FOLLOWS_UP_BOARD"        value="<img src=/imgs/wb_siguientes.gif border=0 width=20 height=20>" -->
---------------------------------

a lot of pages are like this
------- page.shtml  --------
<html>
<!#include file="definitions.shtml" -->

some code....


<a href=#agregar><!--#echo var="FOLLOWS_UP_BOARD" -->

-----------------


on previus versions this echo showed the "less than" sign fine, now it shows 
"lt;" and the tags dont works...

>How-To-Repeat:
as described
>Fix:
i tried using
\<
""<"....."
$<

I think that "\<......" is more natural (like C)
