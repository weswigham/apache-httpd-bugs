>Description:
This actually pertains to mod_setenvif (but the bug database only has a
category for mod_browser - this ought to be updated).

The BrowserMatch directive handling function add_browser() forgets to quote
the regex before passing it to add_setenvif(). This leads to a

  BrowserMatch "MSIE 4\.0b2;" nokeepalive

directive being treated as a
 
  SetEnvIf User-Agent MSIE 4\.0b2; nokeepalive

causing a match for all MSIE browsers because the 4\.0b2 part is being
interpreted as an environment variable to set (this affects all other
BrowserMatch directives which used a regex containing white space).
>How-To-Repeat:
Just telnet in by hand and give *any* User-Agent field containing the string
MSIE - it'll always return an HTTP/1.0 response and close the connection
(assuming the standard BrowserMatch directives in the srm.conf-dist).
>Fix:
Here's the patch:

State-Changed-Why:
I did it a different way... but still gave you credit.  The problem
with your patch is it would have required stuff to be requoted
like \" and such.

Thanks
