>Environment:
I try to convert my web server from AIX 3.2.5 to 4.3.1
Using gcc 2.8 (egcs 1.0.2 precompiled from www.bull.de)
Using gnu-make 3.76.1
>Description:
./configure prefix=....     runs OK
make fails saying "modules/standard/libstandard.a is not a coff file"

 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I read from an IBM message that AIX 4.3 uses a new library format to support
64 bit. They say to convert libraries with "ar -g" commad .. but I don't know
what library and how to do it !

State-Changed-Why:
Two steps you might try:

 1. Upgrade to 1.3b7 (announced a week ago)
 2. Do a "cd src; make clean; make" to ensure that there
    aren't any leftover files from a previous build.

Let us know if this helps.

1) Upgraded to both 1.3b6 and 1.b7 : same result
2) Erased all the tree and reinstalled from gz : same result

New info if after that error I do :

ar -g libstandard.a   (beeing in the right dir)
make

I obtain the same error but on another library (main.a)
seems like ar -g corrects the library

         These errors of "not a COFF file" or "not an export library"
 reported by both GCC and EGCS are due to a bug in an AIX 4.3.0 and AIX
 4.3.1 support library libld.a.  GCC's linker front-end, collect2, uses the
 AIX-provided "ldfcns" to parse object modules and library archives.  The
 version of this library shipped with AIX 4.3.0 and AIX 4.3.1 does not
 correctly support the AIX 4.3 "Big" archive format files.  The support
 function gets confused and returns erroneous information about the
 library being examined.
 
         This bug apparently is fixed in PTFs available for AIX 4.3.1 as
 well as in AIX 4.3.2.  Alternatively, one can workaround the problem by
 building new libraries only containing 32-bit objects using "ar -g" which
 forces the old library archive format.  One can extract the 32-bit members
 of an existing "Big" archive and re-archive them in the old format.  These
 workarounds only should be used as a temporary measure, not as a permamnt
 manner in which to build AIX 4.3 archives as this will cause problems when
 utilizing 64-bit systems.
