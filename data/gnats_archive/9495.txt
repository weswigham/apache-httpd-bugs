Not relevant
>Description:
docs/manual/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html of the 2.0b28 ends with:

    <h3 align="CENTER">Apache HTTP Server Version 1.3</h3>
    <a href="./"><img src="../images/index.gif" alt="Index" /></a>
    <a href="../"><img src="../images/home.gif" alt="Home" /></a>
  </body>
</html>

Should probably read "Apache HTTP Server Version 2.0" ;)
>How-To-Repeat:
tail docs/manual/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html
>Fix:
with vi:
:%s/Apache HTTP Server Version 1.3/Apache HTTP Server Version 2.0/
