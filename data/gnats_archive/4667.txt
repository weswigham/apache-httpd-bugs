Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
>Description:
I just noticed that ap_init_modules is getting called twice during server
start, which causes the init callback function of my shared module
to be called twice too.

I saw that all entries to my log file which i did during initialization 
of my module appeared twice.

It may be possible that this bug only appears with option -X on httpd
>How-To-Repeat:
write a line of text to a file during initialization of a module or
use gdb with a breakpoint on ap_init_modules.
>Fix:
Remove one of the ap_init_modules calls

State-Changed-Why:
It is that way on purpose.  While it could possibly be
changed now for various reasons, for backwards compatibility
state the double init remains.

Your module needs to be able to handle having the init
function called multiple times anyway, since it happens at
HUP/USR1.

 When you send a SIGHUP to the server, all the init functions are called
 again.

 You need to register the appropriate cleanup functions in the appropriate
 pools so that anything you do can be automatically cleaned up when the
 pool is destroyed.
