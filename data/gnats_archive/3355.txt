>Description:
I didn't actually do this.... call me lazy
>How-To-Repeat:
I encountered this using PHP and the log_error function, which eventually calls ap_vsnprintf which calls ap_vformatter(). It doesn't croak too bad on other escape sequences - just segfaults on %n.
>Fix:
My guess is a small check in the ap_vformatter() code around line 843 in ap_snprintf.c would fix it:

        case 'n':
        *(va_arg(ap, int *)) = cc;
        break;

I haven't spent enough time in this code to determine what the actual fix is, but I imagine it's not too difficult.

This might be related to previous bug: 2941

Please give an exact example of a function call to log_error
that uses %n and shows this problem.

I'm not sure how this would be related to PR#2941 that you
mention.

 The actual code in the PHP source is (main.c, 224):
 
 aplog_error(NULL, 0, APLOG_ERR | APLOG_NOERRNO, php3_rqst->server,
 log_message);
 
 passing "%n" as log_message.
 
 In PHP code:
 <?
 	error_log("%n");
 ?>
 
 I wasn't certain that this was related to the other bug report - just
 thought it sounded similar.

 Why do you think this is a bug in Apache?  %n is supposed to do:
 
      n              The  argument  should  be  a  pointer  to  an
                     integer  into  which is written the number of
                     characters written to the output standard I/O
                     stream  so  far  by  this  call  to printf(),
                     fprintf(), or sprintf().  No argument is con-
                     verted.
 
 If you call it without the proper number of arguments (ie. without a
 pointer to an integer as the relevant parameter) then it really isn't
 Apache's job to try to figure that out and, in fact, it can't always
 figure that out.

 That should probably be changed from 'log_message' to
 '"%s", log_message'.

This appears to be due to a bug in the mod_php code.  Since
it's not related to base Apache, I'm closing this.  Thanks
for using Apache!
