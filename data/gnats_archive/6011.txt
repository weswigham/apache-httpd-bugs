>Description:
Whenever I try to start Apache either as a service or as a console, I get the following message: 
"The procedure entry point_ap_pstrdup @ 8 could not be located in the dynamic link ApacheCore.dll"

Then I get a message "error 2186: the service is not responding to the control function.

#LoadModule anon_auth_module modules/ApacheModuleAuthAnon.dll
#LoadModule cern_meta_module modules/ApacheModuleCERNMeta.dll
#LoadModule digest_module modules/ApacheModuleDigest.dll
#LoadModule expires_module modules/ApacheModuleExpires.dll
#LoadModule headers_module modules/ApacheModuleHeaders.dll

#LoadModule speling_module modules/ApacheModuleSpeling.dll
LoadModule status_module modules/ApacheModuleStatus.dll
#LoadModule usertrack_module modules/ApacheModuleUserTrack.dll
LoadModule coldfusion_module modules/ApacheModuleColdFusion.dll

If I comment the last line out it works.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... if you can't load some random third party module, it
seems to me that it is probably something to do with that random
third party module.  We can do nothing about that.  you need to
make sure the module was compiled for the same version of Apache that you are using.
