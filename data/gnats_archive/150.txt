Linux 2.0.14.
>Description:
Problem PR137 described a problem when connecting to the url
    http://www.stockmaster.com/cgi-bin/graph?sym=intc
The server at stockmaster.com (Apache 1.1.1) is returning
a status code of 302 to indicate a temporarily moved page.
Unfortunately, the status line is not HTTP/1.x compliant
and does not have a Reason-Phrase.  It returns
    HTTP/1.0 302
instead of 
    HTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporarily

The proxy module performs a checkmask using the mask of
"HTTP/#.# ### *" which will only match when there is at
least a space following the status code.  In this case
there isn't a space so no headers are recognised (and
the response is treated as HTTP/0.9), thus the proxy
module starts inserting its own headers.  The original
headers then appear in the body and a "Location:" header
is not processed by the client so no redirection is
performed as was intended by the broken page.
>How-To-Repeat:
Access the url through the proxy module:
    http://www.stockmaster.com/cgi-bin/graph?sym=intc
>Fix:
1) Have the remote site fix their page.

2) The Apache proxy module can be more forgiving in its checkmask
call, using a mask of "HTTP/#.# ###*" instead of "HTTP/#.# ### *"
(modules/proxy/proxy_http.c, line 268).

3) Recognise a 1.x status line in a bad format, and display an
appropriate message (eg 502 Bad Gateway).%0

Right you are, Jeremy. The mask fix is fine; I've seen other
servers cause the same result. Check mask in proxy_http.c
changed from "HTTP/#.# ### *" to "HTTP/#.# ###*"
