I config apache as proxy.
(
ProxyRequest on
ProxyRemote http://xxxx.com:8080
)
the site http://xxxx.com:8080 need username and password,
and my browser pop up dialog let me input username and password,
but can not pass.
I trace the packet, the http packet from the user browser has
proxy-authorizion:base xxxx but the proxy (apache) 
not send proxy-authorzion:... to upper proxy.

I test WinGate (a windows proxy) on windows, it send proxy-authorzion.
