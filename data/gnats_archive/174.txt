>Description:
I have applied the fix for PR#100 to 1.2b4 sources (by extracting from the 1.2b6
source tree.

This nearly fixes a problem with stupid browsers (e.g. Sun's HotJava and
JavaWorkShop browsers) that fail to parse a header response if it does
not contain "HTTP/1.0".

Ordinary pages are OK, but if when the server tries to respond with
AUTH_REQUIRED then mod_browser has not been called by the time the header is
prepared so when the error response calls basic_http_header() the table entry
"force-response-1.0" has not yet been set!
>How-To-Repeat:
dbx in basic_http_header() and add 

BrowserMatch JavaWorkShop.1.0 force-response-1.0=True

to your access.conf
>Fix:
Um, not really...
a) Recommend my clients upgrade to new version of their browsers?
   Sun has fixed this in HostJava preBeta2.

b) I suppose I duplicate my document tree under /browser-bug/... and then
   <Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/docs/browser-bug>
	SetEnv force-response-1.0 True
   </Directory>%0

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, I can't duplicate the problem.  If I add a:
	BrowserMatch foo force-response-1.0
line to my config file, then do a request for:
	GET /lim/index.html HTTP/1.0
	User-Agent: foo
I get back a HTTP/1.0 401.  Can you try with a fresh 
1.2b6 distribution?

User reports incomplete local merge was cause of problem;
works fine with 1.2b6.
