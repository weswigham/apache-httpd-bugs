State-Changed-Why:
I have a strong suspicion that the problem you are seeing
may be due to the fact that Apache 1.2 responds with HTTP/1.1
headers.  Your report indicates you're getting HTTP/1.0
responses, but it also looks like it was typed from memory
rather than being an actual transcript.

Can you bring the 1.2 server back up, perhaps on a different
port, and let us know the URL?  That will let us do a little
testing.

I have bring the server (apache.1.2.0) up on 
       http://www.weltbild.de:8000/
       User:     apache
       Password: bug
But try it fast, please, because this is an port where other people
look, too. 

If you try this with Netscape or IE <=3.01 there is no Problem
but with IE3.02 there is a bug!!!

I hope you understand my bad english.

State-Changed-Why:
This is probably fixed with a

  BrowserMatch "MSIE 3\.02" force-response-1.0

directive in your httpd.conf file.
