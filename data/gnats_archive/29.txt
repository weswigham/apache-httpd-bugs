>Environment:
Sun SPARCstation 20
Solaris 2.4
gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
The server compiles and runs OK, DBM authorisation doesn't work.  When an
attempt to load a page from an authorised directory is made, the authorisation
fails, and the following lines are appended to the error log for the server:

[Thu Dec  5 12:29:45 1996] access to /data/www/conf/passwords_emag failed for vif7, reason: could not open dbm auth file
[Thu Dec  5 12:29:45 1996] access to /data/www/htdocs/nz/education/emag/members/index.htm failed for vif7, reason: DBM user ashby not found

Apache 1.1.1 worked OK with exactly the same configuration.  

I have extracted the code that is responsible for openning the DBM file and
wrapped a simple test harness around it to see if it will work independently
of the server, and it does even when running under the same user/group
as the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
# .htaccess file for EMAG members only area

AuthDBMUserFile  /data/www/conf/passwords_emag
AuthDBMGroupFile /data/www/conf/passwords_emag
AuthName members
AuthType Basic  
 
<Limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</Limit>




File access for password file:
-rw-rw-r--   1 bboard   uucp        4096 Nov  7 13:50 /data/www/conf/passwords_emag.dir
-rw-rw-r--   1 bboard   uucp        2048 Dec  5 11:41 /data/www/conf/passwords_emag.pag


Server is running as user 'bboard', group 'uucp'
>Fix:
Not off hand, have had to go back to using 1.1.
