>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1
gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
The example module invalidates "require group ..." directives by always 
returning "TRUE"

This makes it very hard to write replacement authorisation modules.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
example_ckauth() and example_ckaccess() should return DECLINED not OK

State-Changed-Why:
The example module isn't intended to be run as part of a
production server for this among other reasons.  I will
examine this issue in the next few days; thank you for
reporting it.

State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 15 08:36:57 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The appropriate hooks have been modified to return DECLINED
instead of OK, but it needs to be reiterated that this
module SHOULD NOT be used in a production server.  Its
sole purpose for existence is to illustrate the API for
module writers.  The changes should be available in the next
release of Apache 1.3beta.

Thanks for using Apache!
