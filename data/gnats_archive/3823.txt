>Description:
Given a module with a configuration like this, APACI configuration finds that it
does need to link the additional libraries:

 * MODULE-DEFINITION-START
 * Name: mysql_auth_module
 * ConfigStart
     MYSQL_LIB="-L/usr/local/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lm"
     if [ "X$MYSQL_LIB" != "X" ]; then
         LIBS="$LIBS $MYSQL_LIB"
         echo " + using $MYSQL_LIB for MySQL support"
     fi
 * ConfigEnd
 * MODULE-DEFINITION-END

This works fine when this module is compiled statically.  However, if you make
this module --enable-shared during the config, then the resulting .so file does not
have the additional libraries linked, but those libraries are referenced for linking
when building httpd.

I believe that the libraries found to be linked for specific modules this way should
be used when building the .so file, not when linking httpd if that module is marked
to be shared.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure apache with a dynamic module that needs extra libraries as specified above.
>Fix:
Don't configure such modules during the initial build, but afterwards, using apxs.

 It's not such easy because usually you cannot link DSO's against other DSOs
 (i.e. shared libraries here). To solve the problem you either have to build
 this MySQL module statically or build on a smart platform (usually all
 ELF-based platforms are of this type where you can link a DSO against a DSO)
 and use --enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN.
