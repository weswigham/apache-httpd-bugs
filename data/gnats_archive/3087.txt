[Feedback from submitter]
    Doesn't the src/CHANGES file give you what you want?

Yes, thanks.  I didn't know it existed.  Obviously didn't read the mail
and/or examine the distribution closely enough.  Sorry.  On the other
hand, the standard name *is* NEWS ...

Thanks,

State-Changed-Why:

Well, that may be the standard *GNU* file name, but Apache
isn't GNU nor even covered by the GPL.  The CHANGES file
name has its roots in the server's own origin, which may
be a good thing or not -- I have no opinion.
