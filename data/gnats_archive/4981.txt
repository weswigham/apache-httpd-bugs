Ample memory and disk space.
Pre-compiled binary distribution (downloaded 8/Sep/1999). File size is
3,000,130 bytes (2.86MB). I'm assuming this is a complete download -
your FTP listing unhelpfully just says "2.9MB".
>Description:
The 1.3.9 pre-compiled distribution of Apache for Windows won't install as an NT
Service, making it unusable on an NT machine. Three start menu items are created
(start as console app, show docs, install as service). The "Install as Service"
item merely opens the "My Computer" window, and nothing recognisable is added
to the Services window (Control Panel).
I have tries "typical" and various "custom" installations. The pre-compiled
distribution of Apache 1.3.6 for Win32 works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download the current (8/Sep/1999) 1.3.9 Win32 exe and try to install it as an
NT Service.
>Fix:
Try looking at whatever maintenance fixes were made in this area since 1.3.6
Especially whatever gets run under the "Install as NT Service" menu item.
