>Description:
I'm using mod_proxy as a frontend to a bunch of mod_perl sites. My sites send multiple cookies, but mod_proxy only passes the last cookie.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any site that send's multiple cookies; put a mod_proxy in front of it with a ProxyPass directive; only the last cookie will appear on your browser.
>Fix:
It also seems to solve PR 6055...
