Subject: conf file error hangs NT Service Manager when starting Apache 1.3b6

>Environment:
NT40SP3 (uname -a outputted "CYGWIN32_NT WEIQI 4.0 19.0 i586 unknown" but
that's irrelevent, since I'm using the binary release.)
>Description:
When trying to start Apache 1.3b6 from NT Service Manager, a conf file error
would cause the NT Service manager to hang.  Trying to start Apache from the
command line with the same conf files generates an harmless stderr message.
>How-To-Repeat:
Specify "Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes Exec" and then stop and
start Apache from NT Service manager.
>Fix:
Additional notification to the NT Service Manager would probably fix the
problem.  Then again, I'm not familiar with the code.

 Submitter has moved off of NT platform.  He's on Linux now.
