>Description:
(tested on 1.2.4 and 1.2.5)

Suppose the proxy server is http://xyz.com.
 
In httpd.conf put:
 
        ProxyPass /foo/bar http://www.d.umn.edu/cgi-bin
 
then  http://xyz.com/foo/bar/test points to http://www.d.umn.edu/cgi-bin/test
without error.
 
But URLs such as http://xyz.com/foo/bar/test.x fail, stating there is no
such URL. This is displayed on the browser window and the error_log states
there is no such file on the remote server, which is false.
 
In general, I found that any proxy pass request for anything ending in an
extension (.html, .cgi, .x, ...) fail, those items _not_ ending in an
extension succeed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add to httpd.conf:  ProxyPass /foo/bar http://www.d.umn.edu/is/webdev
then try to get /foo/bar/umdjava.html .  This should return the document
http://www.d.umn.edu/is/webdev/umdjava.html, which exists.  However, an error
is generated.

State-Changed-Why:

I cannot reproduce this behaviour.
Please note that versions 1.2 of Apache have a known
bug which causes problems if an other handler (eg.
cgi-script) is mapped to your _local_ url path.

This bug is already fixed in the current source tree
and the fixed version will be available with Apache
1.3b4 and later.
