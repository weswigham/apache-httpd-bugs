>Description:
I use a batch that create automaticaly "AddDescription" from documentation (so it's not easy to avoid such thing).
Some of thoses descriptions have an '&' and it seens to confuse Apache in some situation.

Looking in the code of mod_autoindex, it's the same thing this description holding
'<' but it's needing to implement a real HTML parser to see if the '<' is meanfull
or not ... But i haven't the time :-(((
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a simple description like

AddDescription "Create the consolidations views & tables from JIT table" file

An '>' is appended to the description in fancy indexing.
>Fix:
I know the solution is to convert '&' into '&amp;' in description string (it's what i am doing in my batch for '<').
The for the case of '&', the following patch on mod_autoindex correct this problem and make Apache more 'flexible' (I duno if it's english :-) ).

 This error still in v 1.3.17.
 
 Now mod_autoindex.c must look, starting at line 1302
 
  	else if (desc[x] == '&') {
  	    /* entities like &auml; count as one character
 */
 		int ansx=x;
  	    --maxsize;
  	    for ( ; desc[x] != ';'; ++x) {
  		if (desc[x] == '\0') {
                      maxsize = 0;
                      break;
 		} else if(isspace(desc[x])){
         	x=++ansx;
            	break;
 		}
 	    }
         }
 
 
 
 Someone take care of it ???
