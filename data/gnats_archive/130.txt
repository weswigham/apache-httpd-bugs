>Description:
When ImapeBase is used in the config-file, or base is used in the map-file,
the process handling the request goes onto a loop, when the argument doesn't
contain a '/' e.g.

ImapBase foobar    
(server loops)

ImapBase foobar/
(OK)

>How-To-Repeat:
Make a map-file containing:

map foobar
rect ../foo/bar.html 299,42 499,77

Click on the map and the process handling the request will loop

State-Changed-Why:
The base directive should have a trailing '/' if it is
a directory.  The code has been fixed so if it does not,
instead of an infinite loop it will give an error message.

Much of the parsing code in mod_imap needs fixing; perhaps
after 1.2.
