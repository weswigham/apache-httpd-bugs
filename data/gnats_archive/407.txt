>Description:
When I try to access an HTML document (either through a link or by typing
in the URL myself) that is located in a 'private' directory (protected by
a .htaccess file), I am asked for a password (as is expected).  I click
cancel and am denied access.  However if I access some CGI script in that
directory through a form, I am allowed access.
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm behind a firewall so I'll have to give you the files.
The first file, test.html, provides you with a form and a link.  Clicking
either will take you into the private directory.  If you got there through
the link you will be asked for a password if you got there through the form
you will not be asked for a password.

test.html:
<html>
<body>
<form action=private/test.cgi method=post>
<input type=submit>
</form>
<p>
 
Click <a href="private/index.html">here</a>
</body>
</html>


Here's private/test.cgi:
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
 
print "<html>\n";
print "<body>\n";
print "<h1>Hi</h1>\n";
print "</body>\n";
print "</html>\n";


Here's private/index.html:
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello from index.html</h1>
</body>
</html>


Here's the .htaccess file:
AuthType Basic
AuthName SLAP Utility Private Area
AuthUserFile .htpasswd
<Limit GET PUT>
require valid-user
</Limit>


Here's the .htpasswd file:
guest:Bmb8VdQw2/P.E

Sorry, but I don't

State-Changed-Why:
User reports the below comment resolves their confusion:

You are telling it to limit GET and PUT.  Then you are doing a POST.  If
you want to limit POST, you need to tell it to.

You should also be able to just leave the <Limit> and </Limit> bit out and
have it apply to all methods.
