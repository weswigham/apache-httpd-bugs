>Description:
When proxying is disabled apache processes proxy requests as if such requests were local requests, i.e. as if the local server would be the proxy target.


I call this critical as there are unfortunately sufficient clueless people trying to abuse servers as public proxies that don't get it that public proxying does not work as they get either local pages or just 404 errors.
Thus service quality for legitimate requests is degraded.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run apache either without mod_proxy or proxying disabled. Make sure that http://yourserver/ is a valid URL and that http://yourserver/nosuchdocument_on_your_server does not exist. Then try the following two variants against the server.



Variant A:





telnet yourwebserver 80


GET http://someotherhost.somewhere/ HTTP/1.0





Variant B:





telnet yourserver 80


GET http://someotherhost.somewhere/nosuchdocument_on_your_server HTTP/1.0


>Fix:
As to rfc2616:

   403 Forbidden
   The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
   Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.
   If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make
   public why the request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the
   reason for the refusal in the entity.  If the server does not wish to
   make this information available to the client, the status code 404
   (Not Found) can be used instead.

For variant A:
Returning 200 and the local document is definitely wrong.

For variant B:
Returning 404 is not a very good idea as the clueless ones will keep trying and thus degrade service quality for valid requests.

In short: if proxy requests are not allowed 403 is the proper response to such a request.
