>Description:
 Upgraded to Apache 1.3.9 all okay.  Built
 PHP 4.X and installed with 1.3.9 in a static
 build, all works OK.  Logging fine.
 
 Rebooted machine yesterday.  Logging will
 not work.  Only a restart message in error log;
 no referrals, transfers, or other errors.
 
 Have double checked all srm and httpd.conf files
 and the remain the same, with the old directives
 as before the 1.3.9 upgrade.
 
 Did adding PHP to the status build effect the logging
 of Apache????  Seems to have done so, cause logging
 is at a stop, transfers are fine.
