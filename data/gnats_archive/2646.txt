>Description:
Apache is logging the 414 URI Too Long error, but not sending
an error response back.  Seems to be closing the TCP connection,
rather than sending the error (I get a "document contains no data" out
of Netscape).
>How-To-Repeat:
See: http://zap.w3.org:8008/414test.html; this has links to my server
and the apache.org server.
>Fix:
Not really familiar enough with ap_die to figure out what to do.

State-Changed-Why:

Fixed in rev 1.226 of http_protocol.c for 1.3.2-dev.
Testing can be tricky since we don't do a lingering close
for this type of error, and so the test client needs to
ignore SIGPIPE errors when sending the request.
