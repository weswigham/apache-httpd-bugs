php 3 final release
>Description:
When the UA close an loading connection (Stop button or crash ) ,
the php process launched by Apache never stops.
I've heard it isnt a php specific problem, but affect also other CGI programs. i didn't verified it though.
the php process :
- stays in memory "forever"
- can't be killed ( permission denied in task manager)
- seems to be in a "stopped state" ( uses no cpu time)
- stay even after apache service being restarted
- the only way to get rid of it is to restart the machine.

State-Changed-When: Fri Oct  2 07:00:41 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
As you pointed out, there was a problem affecting all
CGIs under Win32.  Specifically, the pipe handles for
the server side where being inherited in the CGI process.
(See PR 2884).
The fix has been committed to CVS, and you should be able
to get the fix in the next release of Apache, or the 
current CVS code tree.

Thanks for using Apache!
