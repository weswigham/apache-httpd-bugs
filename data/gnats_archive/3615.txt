FreeBSD 2.2.5 - gnu compiler?  
>Description:
Cannot have forms and/or CGI-scripts on the Serverroot home page (index.html,forms do not work as first page of web-site, nor do CGI scripts run).
>How-To-Repeat:
example:  my server name is newpoint.ccctulsa.com.  Doc files (HTML files are in /usr/local/www/data).
First page is index.html and it does NOT run CGI scripts and/or forms properly (if they were in the 
first page).

No.

State-Changed-Why:
I have no idea what you mean by "having forms and/or CGI-scripts
on the ServerRoot".  If you want CGIs to execute outside a ScriptAliased
directory, then please read the FAQ to see how to set that
up.  This is not an appropriate place to ask basic configuration
questions that are described in the FAQ and docs.
