>Description:
I'm not sure if this is a config problem or something you don't have (the docs seem to indict the latter), but I'd like for suEXEC to work for EVERY file, not just CGI/SSIs.  Since I'm dealing with multiple web accounts on a server, I'd like to lock down the /home/username directory to 700, so that only the user and the web server can access that directory.  Unforunately, the "chmod 700" setting locks off the web server in its current state.  I've seen done on other systems (any of OLM.net's boxes, for example), but I don't know if it's a patch or what.

State-Changed-Why:

Noteh the 'exec' part of suexec's name.  It functions
with Apache by changing the UID/GID of a process to handle
a script, after which the process dies.  That would not
be terribly efficient if done for every single request,
and is contrary to suexec's intended purpose in any event.
I'm afraid that suexec isn't the solution for your problem;
you're going to have to solve it using some OS-level choice
of permissions.  But thanks for asking and for using Apache!
