RE: mod_proxy, PR number 3778

This should fix it.  Hopefully it doesn't break anything else.  The
problem is/was: due to the size of the uid/gid fields in the directory
ls, the ".." filename starts one character to the right of all the
other filenames.  Unfortunately, the code used the position of the
".." as the starting position for the remaining filenames (to support
filenames that start with a space).  I did some quick tests, and the
patch seems to correctly handle spaces in filenames.
