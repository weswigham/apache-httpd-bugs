>Description:
 As you restructure your IT training program and consider how you might
 imagine the best way of providing content for your courses, you'll
 find yourself appreciating course content that is already prepared
 and ready for immediate use in your curriculum.  
 
 We design and develop books and curriculum that support Systems Engineering technologies and certifications including:
  A+
  Network+
  i-Net+
  MCSE
  MCDBA 
 (Full course descriptions are available)
 
 Some of our books have been top 10 best sellers through Amazon.com.
 Included with this letter are descriptions of the books that we sell (see Study Guide Descriptions).
 
 I thought you might also be interested to hear about our adaptive and non-adaptive test engine slated to be available 3rd quarter, 2000.  The engine is designed for practice and study.  Test questions and answers are easily added, edited or deleted.  
 
 We can help you with your high-tech training needs including books, books on CD, Instructor led classes and distance learning products.  We also create custom high-tech curriculum for companies. 
 
 We are a one-stop solution for high-tech educational content, training and resources. We offer distance learning and instructor lead products for both individuals and groups and our education solutions meet typical corporate and learning center needs.  W e are a Microsoft Solution Provider (MSP), Microsoft Certified Technical Education Center (CTEC) and a Computer Technology Industry Association Certified Training Center (CompTIA).  We partner with a major University, an international leader in adult-ins tructor-lead and distance learning, to offer graduate and undergraduate credit for many of our courses. 
 
 Please feel free to contact me in the mean time.  I look forward speaking with you further.
