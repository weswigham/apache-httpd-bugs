>Environment:
HP-UX B.10.10
gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
I recently upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2.
Since I have a lot <Location> tags with the same content, I decided to use
the regex facility from 1.2.
Configure choosed for the HP-UX regex.
My testing ran fine, but after a while, a got crazy side effects - after some
investigation I discovered that some regex where not matched anymore (reaload
of the same page ignores the <Location> after a while.
I recompiled with  WANTHSREGEX=yes and all runs fine now.
So the Configure should not choose for HP-UX regex...
>How-To-Repeat:
I have the problem with almost all regex in <Location> eg:
<Location ~ "/cgi-bin/(fxmgr.pl|mailmgr.pl)">
require         valid-user
</Location>
after a while (about 10 reloads), no password will be asked!
>Fix:
Force WANTHSREGEX=yes on HP-U

State-Changed-Why:
Will try to reproduce the problem and verify that it is
not Apache doing something incorrectly that other OSes 
just happen to accept.  After that, will change the default
if necessary.
