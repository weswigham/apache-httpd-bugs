>Description:
In a FancyIndexing style directory index, filenames with "&" in the filename have the rest of their line aligned incorrectly: four characters too far to the left. The filenames are (correctly) being encoded with "&amp;" instead of the naked ampersand. I suspect that all five characters are being counted when calculating the number of spaces needed to align the table correctly.
