>Description:
Apache should use the standard date format ISO 8601.
Apache should use gmtime instead of localtime.
If you don't live in the same timezone as the server how do you understand the date ?

State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Sat May 12 07:48:38 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

First, there are some client applications that parse the mod_autoindex output, which 
would (or will) be broken by this change.  Please don't expect it to be applied until
Apache 2.0 where a better schema is introduced, including proper, parsable XML.
But I see two issues, one, you are introducing seconds (which is certainly not a
requirement within ISO8601), and second, your patch violates ISO8601 by prepending
the zulu time _suffix_.

At a minimum, the format needs to show "1998-02-22 23:42Z", not "1998-02-22Z23:42:34".
Since the timezone is a constant through the listing, it can (perhaps) be omitted
entirely for brevity.  The Zulu time suffix has the annoying property of appearing
(in many typefaces, to many folks) as the digit 2.  Better to display the heading 
as "Last Modified (Z)" or "Last Modified (+0000)" rather than intrude on the limited
space available within the listing itself.

On the issue of 'dictating' this to Apache users, many web sites _are_ local, with 
local content aimed at a local audience.  This proposal needs some controling 
directives to give the operator some flexibility, by vhost, to make the information 
meaningful in it's context.

And finally, the user obviously is the end-target of this information.  Some facility
to specify the time zone with the request would be a very worthwhile facility.  This
would need to be done such that other users don't see the cached results of the
request, so it would need to be some sort of ?z=+0500 or ?z=-0100 argument.

Under Apache 2.0, apr is being updated to allow this sort of fine-grained control of
dates for an international audience.  This work [while breaking existing consumers
of mod_autoindex results] should be done once for all.

Thanks for the proposal and your patch, I'll tag it as suspended for consideration 
in Apache 2.0.

 OK, XML is much better.

 OK, this is not standard. Maybe it was standard time ago.

 If you omit the timezone then you should refere to UTC.

 But by default should be UTC. If it's not UTC mod_autoindex should show always the timezone.

 Why is not the user the one that put the date sent by apache in the
 stangest time format he wants. Using only XML would be great !
 But I know old browsers can't get XML

 The best solution would be using only XML with UTC.
