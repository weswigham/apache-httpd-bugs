Closing misfiled PR; you need to use the same subject

>Unformatted:
The workaround is to start JServ manually (set ApjServManual on in
httpd.conf).
It seems that the ServerSocket construction doesn't specify an IP
address even if
the default (localhost) is in effect for ApjServDefaultHost.  This
causes the IP address for the socket to be 0.0.0.0.  I don't know where
the SocketException is coming from, but I looked at
AuthenticatedServerSocket, which seems to be called by
Jserv, which actually seems to be issuing the error message.
