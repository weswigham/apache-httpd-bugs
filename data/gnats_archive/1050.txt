Solaris 2.5.1
>Description:
I have written some perl scripts to allow my apache server to run any number
of virtual servers under Solaris.  The script also allows for splitting out 
access_log files to for each server by adding the %v option to the CustomLog
directive.  The question - would it be possible to allow the %v option to
apply to the error_log as well?  That would be very convenient, as we want to
give our clients access to their error_log for debugging CGI script problems
and looking for missing files, but unfortunately they have to look at the
error_log for the entire server.

I'm going to post the scripts to the web as soon as they've been tested a bit
more - it's nothing too special really, just a cascading PERL job for every
200 FD, and probably none too efficient, but it works dandy for these big low/
medium usage multiple VD servers.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Either allow a CustomErrorLog directive, or perhaps a very simple
VirtualErrorLog which puts the virtual server name as a leader in the error
log:

  www.foo.com: access to /usr/local/httpd/DOMAINS...

Unfortunately, it isn't that easy to do something like
this.  There are a lot of different places messages
can come from and they are not in a standardized form.
Also, any stderr from CGIs goes to the error log and we
can't control that.

There are a few things that could be done to help a bit,
but I'm not aware of anyone planning to do so in the
forseeable future.

 Not really.  All that is done is a different file descriptor is for the
 log.  The CGI is run with stderr pointing to that file.  Apache isn't in
 the loop any more.  All that can be done easily is mess with what file
 descriptor gets the output, we can't edit it in-stream.
 
 There are various workarounds and ways to do something like this, but it
 isn't an easy change.

 Hmmm...I see.  That makes sense; too bad there's not another way to get
 around it.  I suppose one could attach STDERR of the CGI process to a pipe
 on the httpd process and read it in that way to do the formatting, but
 that's a bit of code to put together, not to mention the possibility of
 deadlock to account for, since forking a child to handle it would be
 somewhat silly. 
 
 Perhaps I'll dust off what's left of my C that hasn't been completely
 PERL'ized and see if I can make it do that....
 
 Thanks for the information, as well as a great server,
 
 David.
