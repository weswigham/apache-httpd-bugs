This is the binary release of Apache 1.3b3 for Windows
>Description:
See "how can we repeat this problem"
>How-To-Repeat:
Unable to get NT or 95 to detect .htaccess to prompt USR/PW box.  If I set it manually in access.conf (instead of inside .htaccess) the USR/PW box appears for the protected directory, but isn't accessing the password file specified in the path.

State-Changed-Why:
In 1.3b3 the password file has to be relative to the
ServerRoot or DocumentRoot; forget which.  Look in the
error log to see what file it is trying to open.
You may also have your file formatted incorrectly, or 
not have a trailing end of line; try adding a blank
line at the end.

The format has to be "user:password" on each line, with
password in plain text.

As to why a htaccess file isn't working, you probably
don't have the proper AllowOverride set for that directory
in your *.conf files to allow AuthConfig
to be changed in htaccess files.
