>Originator:     joachim.durchholz@halstenbach.de
>Release:        1.3.22 (Cygwin)
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Cygwin 1.3.5-1 on NT 4 PL 6 (NT Patchlevel is a guess)
>Description:
Starting Apache with "apachectl start" will give a Windows message box reporting "Windows cannot locate libhttpd.dll in the PATH", and the full path (wording differs).
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Cygwin and Apache for Cygwin.
>Fix:
As a temporary fix, I have added the following line to the top of my apachectl script:
PATH=/usr/local/apache/libexec:$PATH
Note that the -R option in the HTTP= line cannot work, since the Apache executable is linked in a way that it requests that its DLLs are loaded on start-up.

I suspect that the build process uses the wrong flags for linking the DLL. I noticed that the recent release notes for Cygwin mentioned some ld issues, but I haven't taken a closer look.

 the build process for the binary release is done ok for Cygwin.
 
 The created DLLs go to /usr/local/apache/libexec, like the shared
 object files in the UNIX flavored world. 
 
 It's up to the user to "include" this DLL path for the main executable
 /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd.exe.
 
 There will be a "Cygwin" layout style in the sources now, which
 enables user to self-compile a package with Cygwin specific layout.
 Unless the binary release layout is not changes Cygwin users have to
 include the /usr/local/apache/libexec patch on their own to $PATH.
