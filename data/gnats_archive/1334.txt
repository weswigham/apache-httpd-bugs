State-Changed-Why:
The WIN32 port is already multithreaded.  Apache's code was
designed for multithreading originally so multithreaded ports
are not very difficult.  There have been two other (non-free)
ports which are multithreaded.  For Apache 2.0 we plan to
exploit posix threads on unix systems.
