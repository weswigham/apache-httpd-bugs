>How-To-Repeat:
We have a server heavy used by apache and squid . I overload the server.
>Fix:
I saw that the pb is the listen queue in Linux and that we must undefined FCNTL_SERiALIZED_ACCEPT or increase the NR_OPEN and NR_FILE but I have already 3000 for NR_OPEN and 1024 for NR_FILE.

Some said that we must compile with USE_FCNTL_SERiALIZED_ACCEPT

In fact, I am not sure about this solution.
