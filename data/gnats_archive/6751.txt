State-Changed-Why:

You do not provide the full error messages, but this
error is surely either a basic configuration issue,
or a problem with your compilation of php.  Either
way, this is not the correct forum to ask the question.
The php mailing list or the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix newsgroup
might be good choices.

Thanks for using Apache.
