When i try to start apache I get the following failure:

Starting httpd: Syntax error on line 403 of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
                Invalid command "PerlHandler", perhaps misspelled or
                defined by a module not included in the server configuration.

What can I do to fix this??
