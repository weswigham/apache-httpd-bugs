Windows NT 4.0 (SP3), Intel Pentium-300, 64 RAM
>Description:
I can't play .ram-file (link on .ra-file) because of error. It says 'check the name of the file and try again'. Seemes like Apache can't handle Real Audio. I checked mime.types - there're definitions for real Audio format. 
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.mustjoe.tln.edu.ee/leshii -> Enter-> Real Audio -> Try to listen any sound file.
