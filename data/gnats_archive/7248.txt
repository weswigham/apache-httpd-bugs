>Originator:     strube@physik3.gwdg.de
>Release:        1.3.17
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Solaris 7 sparc (SunOS 5.7 Generic_106541-12), gcc-2.7.2.3
>Description:
Adding third-party shared modules (e.g., mod_auth_mysql-2.20) may result
in unresolved references to libgcc.a when starting httpd.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Whenever gcc is used, do not define LD_SHLIB=ld, LDFLAGS_SHLIB=-G,
but rather LD_SHLIB=gcc, LDFLAGS_SHLIB=-shared (in src/Configuration,
following line 1148).
(Also for Sun cc, it would be preferable to use LD_SHLIB=cc, LDFLAGS_SHLIB=-G,
as it then tests for pure text.)

 Sorry, this was insufficient for gcc-2.7.2.3 but works for gcc-2.95.2.1.
 For gcc-2.7.2.3, one has also to add: LIBS_SHLIB=-lgcc .
