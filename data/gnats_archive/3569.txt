>Environment:
Linux 2.0.35, i686, gcc
>Description:
MultiViews is ignored for the HeaderName file.
For example using the option "HeaderName HEADER" with MultiViews will
not look for HEADER.html.en file, only for HEADER.html
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the MultiViews option. Set the HeaderName option to HEADER.
Create a directory without index.html. Create a file called HEADER.html.en.
Set the accepted languages in your browser to English [en]. Open the
directory in your browser. The HEADER.html.en file will not be displayed.
Rename the file to HEADER.html. Reload the page. The HEADER.html will
be displayed.
>Fix:
Add the call to the MultiView function (handle_multi() ??) in the mod_negotiation 
module when opening the HeaderName file.

State-Changed-Why:

This behaviour is explicitly documented in the
mod_autoindex module page.  Using MultiViews for this
lookup presents certain problems, such as what to do if
there are HEADER.jpg, HEADER.html, and HEADER.txt
files -- which should be displayed and should the image be
a possibility?

However, doing this lookup with a subrequest is on my list
of things to address, so I'm marking this report as
suspended.

 This was fixed by Ray S. Brandon and checked in by Ken Coar as level 1.107 of the mod_autoindex.c
 file on May 13, 1999. The fix will be included in the release that follows 1.3.6 (whatever that is).

 ... Any resemblance between the above views and those of my employer,
 my terminal, or the view out my window are purely coincidental.  Any
 resemblance between the above and my own views is non-deterministic.  The
 question of the existence of views in the absence of anyone to hold them
 is left as an exercise for the reader.  The question of the existence of
 the reader is left as an exercise for the second god coefficient.  (A
 discussion of non-orthogonal, non-integral polytheism is beyond the scope
 of this article.)

This was fixed by Ray S. Brand (as noted above). It will be
