>How-To-Repeat:
I think that this is a timeout problem - the CGI timed out. It could also be a 
failure in the CGI but I don't think so. If you arent satisfied by my proposed
fix, I will attempt to create a CGI that will reproduce it for you.
>Fix:
The problem appears to be an invalid assumption by saferead_guts (src/main/buff.c) 
on Win32, or an improper Win32 implementation of ap_read (same file). 

saferead_guts loops until it gets no error or the error is other than EINTR.
However, ap_read for Win32 calls the Win32 API function ReadFile directly.
Because it's not using the C RTL, errno isn't set. If a) ReadFile fails and 
b) errno has the value EINTR initially, saferead_guts retries the read. In
my situation, the cgi process has gone away so ReadFile persistently returns
an error status. Because no code is setting the errno flag, it loops endlessly.

Since I presume ReadFile is being used for a valid reason (i.e. you won't
want to switch to using the C RTL read() routine), I suggest that the logic
be modified for Win32 to not check for the EINTR condition. There is no 
equivalent to the EINTR interrupt of a system call on Win32.

State-Changed-Why:
Jim, thanks for the info. Did you verify that errno 
was indeed set to EINTR? I have a fix for this in the 
current development tree, but one tester is still reporting the infinite loop problem. 

If you are interested, you can download the latest development code for Apache 1.3 from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs and give it a spin. 
I'd be interested to know if you still see the same problem.
