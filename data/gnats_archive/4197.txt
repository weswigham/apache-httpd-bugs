>Description:
I attended WCW'99, http://www.ircache.net/Cache/Workshop99/, last week.
During which, Craig Willis, http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~cew/, gave a presentation,
http://www.ircache.net/Cache/Workshop99/Papers/wills-abstract.html,
on the cachability of web resources.

He mentioned that _identical_ resources which are replicated on more than one
server will have different etags, because a resource's inode is used to 
calculate its etag. This will be a problem when these servers sit behing a 
reverse proxy. Not sure how much of a problem though.

State-Changed-Why:
Yeah but the joy of etags is that you can collect as many as
you want... and they're tied to the resource (uri) they came
from.

If two "generations" of a URI map to the same inode there's
always the mtime to distinguish the two.  If two identical
copies of the file exist on two servers with differing etags
then the reverse proxy will just end up with a few choices
for the file... it means it'll be transferred more than once...
but oh well.  If you're using a reverse proxy you can just
disable etag comparison -- it is a local decision after all.
