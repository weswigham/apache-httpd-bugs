No Compiler, Apache bin-dist. 1.3.12 with openssl, php4 by opensa
>Description:
accessing a web-site throught a proxy-cache-enabled apache 1.3.12 server
timed out in accessing serveral site files like hmmm.gif, etc.
after looking in error.log of my apache i recognized following message:
(13)Permission denied: proxy gc: open(c:/opt/apache/proxy/cache/...).
It seems to me that this is an old problem of apache because it has been
mentioned above in bug-report-database serveral times, but i did not found
a real bug-fix for this problem. i have no compiler or source in order
to patch the proxy_cache.c - source.

Do you have any other idea without disabling cache-functionality of apache ?
