State-Changed-Why:
As the message states, there is something wrong with your
compiler installation.  There is nothing we can do about
that.

>Unformatted:
I installed gcc-2.8.1 gcc compiler in /opt/gcc/bin because it was the
default directory for HP UX 10.20.
and I tried to run configure and I got the following message. Please Help

# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache

Stop.
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!
