>Description:
I had a .htaccess file that looked like:

AuthUserFile /usr/local/www/server/conf/htpasswds
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName "Student Information"
AuthType Basic

<Limit GET>
require user parent
</Limit>

and there was no final carriage return or newline at the end of the
</Limit> directive.  We were running Apache/1.1.1 and it worked fine,
but we got the following message in the error log in 1.3b5:

[Tue Feb 24 21:54:54 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: /usr/local/www/cis/books-restricted/cgi-bin/.htaccess: </Limit> takes no arguments

The user also got a server error 500 message.

The problem went away after I added a newline.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Probably a simple parsing problem either when reading the htaccess file
or parsing the limit directive
