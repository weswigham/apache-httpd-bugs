During heavy load and many interrupted requests, after the server has logged
a "Apache->print lost connection.." message, the scripts start to behave
very strangely resulting in Server Errors.

A typical strange behaviour is trying to AUTOLOAD a previously loaded module:

[Wed Oct 15 14:09:43 1997] Apache->print lost connection to client 193.15.66.56
Use of uninitialized value at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Quote.pm line 55.
Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method Apache::ADAuth() is deprecated 
 at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Quote.pm line 55.
[Wed Oct 15 14:10:53 1997] Can't locate auto/Apache/ADAuth.al in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib/perl5/sun4-solaris/5.00403 /usr/local/lib/perl5 /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/sun4-solaris /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl)
 at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Quote.pm line 55

Note that the script runs for hundreds of times without any error before this
happens. The module Apache::ADAuth is used as a PerlAuthenHandler, but the error
occurs even without Authentication handlers, in other loaded modules such as
Apache::Registry.

After the error has accured once, that server process produces the error for
every request.
>How-To-Repeat:
The error always accur when repeatedly interrupting requests to the script.
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
This is a mod_perl issue; we can not support every module
that someone may make available for Apache.  It is almost
certainly something in your perl script or in mod_perl
and not something in the Apache core.  I will forward your
message to the mod_perl mailing list.
