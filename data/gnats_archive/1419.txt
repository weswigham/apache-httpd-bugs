Piping logs to an external program actually runs the program twice.
Looks like its a result of calling dup() and then closing the old
stream?

Also, for the new 1.3 with the reliable piping, it would be *great* to
see some other features in this area, since so many people are piping to
external programs...

I'd like to see a way to have Apache buffer a set amount of logging information
before piping it out... say something we could #define so that Apache
didn't keep piping out 128 bytes of information, but buffered 4-8K so
our external processors can run more efficiently?
>How-To-Repeat:
Use a simple C program to log to and have it print to it's stdout when
it start's up.

Comment-Added:

Under Linux with 1.3b3-dev I wasn't able to reproduce
the bug.
(Dean: or was this fixed by your patch which introduced
 that new pool which is passed to child_init/_exit?)

State-Changed-Why:
Is your program handling getting an EOF properly?  It
is normal behavior for Apache to restart the program
multiple times while it is running.  When your script
gets an EOF, it should exit.

If this doesn't help, please give an example of a minimal
script that shows this problem.

 You probably have "| foo" and you're seeing both the /bin/sh which is
 running that command, and the command itself.  Look at the parentage to
 find out... ps ajxww or ps alxww or something like that.  It's unlikely
 that two processes are actually running.  You can do "| exec foo" if it
 bugs you.
 
 1.3b2 piping is slightly borken, every time a httpd child exits it will
 spawn another pipe child.  Define -DNO_OTHER_CHILD or wait until 1.3b3. 
 
 If you read the 1.3 perf-tuning document at
 www.apache.org/docs/misc/perf-tuning.html you'll discover the
 BUFFERED_LOGS define. 
 
 It's impossible to increase the size of a pipe() in a portable manner. 
 They're almost always 4k deep.  Buffering behaviour across a pipe (the
 buffer in the kernel) also differs greatly across unixes.  For example,
 under linux, if the writer is fast enough they can fill a 4k pipe 1 byte
 at a time before the reader is awakened to read the pipe.  This is likely
 different elsewhere. 
 
 If you need to tweak the kernel buffer for the pipe then you'll need to
 replace the code with a socketpair() call and use setsockopt() and see if
 it helps... but that's not something we'll be putting into the server any
 time soon because it opens a portability can o' worms.
