>Description:
I'm using apache as a fancy http firewall proxy.  Outside world accesses my site via www.listworks.com and gets to firewall.  Apache redirects all accesses to my internal NT Server 4.0 IIS server (not accessible from outside the firewall).  I use the following configuration:

ProxyPass        / http://<internal server>.listworks.com/postoffice
ProxyPassReverse / http://<internal server>.listworks.com/postoffice

The first part, ProxyPass, works properly.  However, when I use it by itself, the user can't follow any links within the site (they all reference <internal server>, which as I said, isn't accessible outside the firewall).  When I include the ProxyPassReverse directive, the apache server goes into an endless loop, and I receive the following over and over in the access_log file until I kill apache:

ehrpc.listworks.com - - [11/Jun/1998:17:08:19 -0400] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 302 154
ehrpc.listworks.com - - [11/Jun/1998:17:08:19 -0400] "GET // HTTP/1.1" 302 154
ehrpc.listworks.com - - [11/Jun/1998:17:08:19 -0400] "GET // HTTP/1.1" 302 154
ehrpc.listworks.com - - [11/Jun/1998:17:08:19 -0400] "GET // HTTP/1.1" 302 154
ehrpc.listworks.com - - [11/Jun/1998:17:08:19 -0400] "GET // HTTP/1.1" 302 154
ehrpc.listworks.com - - [11/Jun/1998:17:08:19 -0400] "GET // HTTP/1.1" 302 154
                            <etc>

Notice that the first item is slightly different -- "/" vs. "//".

Also note that it works perfectly as long as the directory being proxied is not "/".  I tried it with a sub-directory and it worked fine.

My web site can't get out until this is fixed... Please help!!  TIA
>How-To-Repeat:
Just set up a ProxyPass / ... and a ProxyPassReverse / ...

No -- sorry.

 Hi.
 I have done some research on your bug report to apache (with
 synopsis "ProxyPassReverse causes endless loop when Proxying "/"
 directory"). I have found out that probably you are trying to
 do reverse-proxying on a subdirectory of your internal server,
 and this causes a loop of redirections. As a temporary fix you
 can try to add a trailing slash your internal URLs:
 
 ProxyPass        / http://<internal server>.listworks.com/postoffice/
 ProxyPassReverse / http://<internal server>.listworks.com/postoffice/
 
 Anyway, we'll try to find a decent solution for this as soon as
 possible.
 Hope this helps.
 Regards.

As a workaround you can use mod_rewrite.
BTW, have you set UseCanonicalName to 'On' or 'Off'?

 I'm tempted to say we should just document this rather than attempt to
 work around it.  Unless someone can find a cheap test to implement.

 lars,
 
    I received a work-around that fixed the problem from Alvaro Martínez
 Echevarría (alvaro@lander.es).  The solution was to add a trailing slash to
 the redirected URL, like this:
 
     ProxyPass      /    http://<internal server>.listworks.com/postoffice/
     ProxyPassReverse /  http://<internal server>.listworks.com/postoffice/
 
    This seems to be necessary since 'postoffice' is an internal directory on
 my IIS server.
 
    He also implied that this shouldn't be necessary (that they would work on
 a better fix).  For me, this is good enough!!! :-)
