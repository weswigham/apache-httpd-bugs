   When the cache size is big (100,000 by example) the garbage collect 
not works and the cache grow forever.
   When the cache size is little (10,000) by example it works ok.

    The space field at the struct cache_conf (at mod_proxy.h) should 
a long int, not a int.

State-Changed-Why:
Interesting theory as to why the cache continues to grow...
did you implement this in your local server?  Did this
actually fix your problem?  If so, could you provide a patch?
Thanks.

    No, the problem continues. I changed the type of the variable, but 
 the cache still grows forever.
    
    Thanks.

 Show me the directives in your config file relating to the proxy.
 
 How big do you think the cache should grow to?  How big is it growing?
 How are you determining the size?

 >Show me the directives in your config file relating to the proxy.
 The directives follows:
 
 ProxyRequests on
 ProxyRemote ftp://* http://proxy.rio.com.br:3128
 ProxyRemote http://* http://proxy.rio.com.br:3128
 CacheRoot /var/lib/httpd/cache
 CacheSize 102400
 CacheGcInterval 2
 CacheMaxExpire 24
 
 >How big do you think the cache should grow to?
 
    100 Mb plus any files created in the last 2 hours. My network isn´t 
 hard-used. The size shouldn´t above 200 Mb.
 
 >How big is it growing?
 
    Still growing forever. I Discovered this when the hard-disk was full. 
 (1 Gb)
 
 >How are you determining the size?
 
    Using the command du -s /var/lib/httpd/cache

     Analyzing the source of apache, I discovered this line in the file 
 proxy_cache.c:
 
 148   files = make_array(r->pool, 100, sizeof(struct gc_ent *));
 
     The elements of this array are the files of cache. The limit of 
 files in this array is 100. But the great part of the files is little, 
 then the files ignored (above 100th) isn´t unlink of th cache. 
 
     If the limit of 100 is changed for 1000 in my site resolved the 
 problem.
 
     Sorry, my english is very, very bad.
 
     Thanks.
     Albaney.

 Hmm.  Then there is something else wrong.  That number just specifies the
 starting number of elements.  Array functions expand this as necessary. =20
 
 Thanks, perhaps someone can track this down with this information.

Comment-Added:
The Win32 Port did not correctly identify directories in
it's garbage collection routine.  This issue is resolved
in the forthcoming release of Apache 1.3.13.  Please test
and see if that solves your issue (see dev.apache.org for
instructions on downloading the development tree if you
just can't wait for the rollout), and please report back
your success or failure with these changes.
State-Changed-From-To: analyzed-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Mon Oct 16 23:01:03 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

This report is closed, since there are many platforms
crossed up that had many different issues.  All of the
GC issues should be now resolved in 1.3.14.
