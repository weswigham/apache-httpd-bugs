>Description:
I changed all "trace." directives to "log." and
specified "log.file=/tmp/jserv.log"
in /usr/local/apache/conf/jserv.properties.

General servlet logging works as specified by
the log.channel directives, but the log() method
does not work from within any of my servlet
methods.

Perhaps there is a log.channel.log directive
that needs to be set to "true"?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try using the log("any message") method from within
any servlet method.
>Fix:
Sorry, I don't have any suggestions.
