>Description:
For example: the URL
http://www.weltenhaus.net/diverse/moerder/../BER204.JPG
provides a perfect result even though the path "moerder" is not
existant at the server. Doing this, people can a) severely skew
my statistics by introducing arbitrary keywords and b) publish
URLs on my server which sound clearly misleading.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.weltenhaus.net/diverse/moerder/../BER204.JPG
>Fix:
Check the complete path for existance instead of taking the shortcut and
reducing it with the given instances of ".."

State-Changed-Why:

There was a debate on this issue on the development list,
but nobody volunteered any code to change this behaviour.
My suggestion to you would be just to deny any requests
that contain "..".  This can be done either with a
<location> section or a setenvif directive in combination
with a "deny" directive.

I have "suspended" this problem report for future
consideration.

Thanks for using Apache!
