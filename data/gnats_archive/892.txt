SunOS redact 5.5.1 Generic sun4c sparc SUNW,Sun_4_50
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
Currently we are using a modifed version of the Cern 3.0 Proxy server.
This has additions in it to allow ports 443 and 1352 to pass through it.
The config file has:-
Pass    connect://*:443
Pass    connect://*:1352
I have tried the proxy as is and the access log does report:-
ghillie - - [21/Jul/1997:16:50:43 +0100] "CONNECT redacut:1352 HTTP/1.0" 503 265
ghillie - - [21/Jul/1997:16:50:50 +0100] "CONNECT redacut:1352 HTTP/1.0" 503 265
which does seem somewhat successful.
However the Notes client reports that "the connection request failed"

My question is, should I expect this method of connect to work with the
apache proxy server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Can give details about Notes setup, but basically the client is setup
with a connection document that details the HTTP proxy server and
RPC Notes proxy information.
