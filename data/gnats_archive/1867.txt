When running CGI counter.exe(commands provided by 
http://home.t-online.de/home/trojan/indexe.htm)
<IMG SRC="cgi-bin/counter.exe?key=index.html&style=1">,
I get, "[Tue Feb 24 19:37:03 1998] [error] malformed header from script.
Bad header=HTTP/1.0 200 OK: c:/apache/cgi-bin/counter.exe"
When I run the same program on ZB server, it works fine.

State-Changed-Why:
That is not a proper CGI script.  As per the CGI spec,
only nph- scripts (ie. named nph-whatever) can output
the HTTP/1.0 ... first line.  Some servers will accept it
anyway, but that is not what the CGI spec says.

See http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ for details on the
CGI spec.
