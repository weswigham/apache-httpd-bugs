>Environment:
DYNIX/Ptx (a variant of UNIX running on Sequent systems)
>Description:
Sequent Computer Systems manufactures high-end UNIX open systems used
typically for data-warehousing, large database applications.   Sequent
systems are getting very popular even for web applications.  Apart from
being a Java Licensee,  Sequent would love to support and
make available fast web servers to meet the ever increasing demand of
web users.    Apart from successfully proving to be one of the best
highly scalable, high availability systems,  Sequent would like to  
run the best web servers on its platform.  Is there a plan to port Apache 
on to Sequent platform?   Is it something that you would be interested to
discuss with Sequent?
 
Thanks.

 If you folks want to provide a set of patches we'd gladly include them. 
 Or, if you're willing to give us access to a sequent for the purposes of
 porting we'd gladly do the work ... we've done the basics for porting to
 an older version of dynix/ptx but I think we ran into problems getting it
 to run.  This was on a much older sequent (one of the ones that the CSUA
 at Berkeley was given).  Access to recent hardware/versions of the os
 would be excellent.
 
 Apache 1.3 is coming up on feature freeze shortly, so it'd be nice to get
 this done in the next couple weeks.

 Yes, www.sequent.com is running Apache.  The source knows about ptx and it 
 builds just fine....
