RedHat 4.2 on Alphaserver  1000A 5/333  ( single processor )
server runs standalone, although NFS is running, local disks 
are mounted by other machines, but the directory tree of this server is all
on local disks. 


>Description:
After a shell script run by a cron job stops apache and moves the log files,
then starts apache,  the server only runs for a few hours. Then the children die
 and the parent becomes unresponsive. 
HTTP Requests  hang untill timeout.
If I then kill the parent, then restart by hand, everything is fine.
This happened  consistently with  1.3.0 and 2 previous versions
( 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 )

No unusual messages appear in the error logs.
i.e. 
The end of the old log:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[Thu Sep  3 13:44:11 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.0 (Unix) mod_perl/1.12 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Mon Sep  7 00:00:00 1998] [notice] httpd: caught SIGTERM, shutting down

The new log::::::::::::::::::::

[Mon Sep  7 00:01:16 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.0 (Unix) mod_perl/1.12 configured
 -- resuming normal operations
[Mon Sep  7 10:28:23 1998] [notice] httpd: caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[Mon Sep  7 10:28:48 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.0 (Unix) mod_perl/1.12 configured
 -- resuming normal operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have looked high and low for any other desription of this bug, so I apologize 
if I missed mention of it. This is the shell script :

#!/bin/sh

dat=`date +%Y%m%d`

cd /home/logs
/usr/local/apache_1.3.0/sbin/apachectl stop
# kill `cat httpd.pid`
sleep 60 
# rm -f httpd.pid

set -- `ls`
mkdir $dat
for u
do
#       echo "$u -> $dat.$u"
        cp $u $dat/$dat.$u
        > $u
done

/usr/local/apache_1.3.0/sbin/apachectl start
 

Thanks for your attention.

State-Changed-Why:
My wild guess is that there's something missing in your cron
environment which is present in your interactive environment.
If this is still happenning, can you use "strace" to find
out what the parent is doing:

strace -p pid_of_parent

Send us the trace, thanks.

This sounds like the same kernel bug described in 3312:

no solution known

State-Changed-Why:
Another user has reported upgrading to linux 2.0.36 and
apache 1.3.6 fixed a very similar problem.  If you continue
to experience this problem after upgrading, please open a
new report.

Thanks
