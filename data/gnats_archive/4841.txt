>Description:
For some reason this wrapper path is crashing the Apache server.  

wrapper.classpath=/usr/local/apache/lib/swingall-1.0.3.jar

The swingall-1.0.3.jar is in the correct directory and we have verified that 
the jar is perfectly fine.  The swingall-1.0.3.jar is not the only wrapper
path giving us problems two other jars also will crash the server unless 
commented out. Also on a different machine all jars declared in a wrapper
cause the server to fail and when these same jars where copied to my machine
they all worked except the same the three that continually cause my server to
bomb.  Also the exact same wrapper and jar worked perfect with previous versions
of jserve.

The only error that appears is in the jserve error log:

[09/08/1999 16:51:36:976] (EMERGENCY) ajp11: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007
[09/08/1999 16:51:36:976] (EMERGENCY) ajp11: function connection fail
[09/08/1999 16:51:47:073] (EMERGENCY) wrapper: JServ (1549) didn't die nicely, killing it


Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!

 Are you sure that all those entries in your wrapper.classpath are
 readable by the user under wich you run JServ???
