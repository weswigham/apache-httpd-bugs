>Description:
I'm not sure it it's really a problem/bug of mod_rewrite, but here's the
description.

When I use [P]-redirects everything is fine unless I activate
a parent cache via 'ProxyRemote'.

My test configuration:

  RewriteRule ^/test(.*)$ http://www.si.unix-ag.org/foobar$1 [P]

and

  ProxyRemote * http://www-cache.uni-siegen.de:3128


When I access the URL-Path /test/ the Apache (mod_proxy) issues the
request:

  GET /test/ HTTP/1.0
  Host: www.si.unix-ag.org

But this request is wrong, because /test/ is the _local_ URL-path but
not the URL-path of the remote server which is - in this test - 
http://www.si.unix-ag.org/foobar/.

When I disable ProxyRemote the correct page is retrieved...

The reason why I'm using mod_rewrite as the category of this bug report
is that it's very strange that mod_proxy sees the local URL that is
used in the RewriteRule directive.

Please note that I reported a very similar bug with ProxyRemote
several weeks ago.

P.S.: The parent proxy mentioned in the above example is a Squid-Cache
       (1.1.10), but I also used a dummy daemon to check the request
       Apache made. So it's not a problem with the parent cache itself,
       because the syntax of the request is ok, but contains the wrong
       URL-Path.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you reverse the order of mod_proxy and mod_rewrite in
your Configuration file, rebuild, and let us know the
result? You may want to try this on 1.2.0.

Comment-Added:

The ProxyRemote directive is broken, it should
send a full proxy-request (with or without Host-header),
e.g.

 GET http://www.somehost.tld/foobar.html HTTP/1.0

instead of

 GET /foobar.html HTTP/1.0
 Host: www.somehost.tld
