>Organization:
>Environment:
running Apache 1.3.19 with MSI installer, on Windows 2000 + Service Pack 1.  PHP4 is installed.
>Description:
I'm running apache with Virtual Servers on my Windows 2000 computer, and about a minute after it gets hit by an EXTERNAL user (not on my lan) the computer restarts.  It doesn't seem to matter what sort of hit it is, even a directory listing will do it.

This problem only developed in 1.3.19, as I was using 1.3.17 fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
If the server is hit, it reboots.

State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 10:58:44 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
I can only offer that noone has seen this behavior outside
of php, so I'd suggest you follow the bug tracking on the
php site, and try upgrading both apache and php to the most
recent versions.
