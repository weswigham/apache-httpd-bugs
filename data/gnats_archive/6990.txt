>Environment:
FreeBSD 4.1.1-STABLE
>Description:
If the key string contains \n, the external program will treat this like two
different requests, and all following requests will get incorrect replies.
>How-To-Repeat:
RewriteMap prg:/the_prog.pl (see below)
RewriteRule ^(.+)$    ${prg:$1}

Now fetch http://servername/test%0aboom.lala, and take a look at /tmp/the_prog.log. You'll get something like
request:/test reply:/test0
request:boom.lala reply:boom.lala1

If you perform one more request (ex. http://servername/nexttest), you'll get
request:/nexttest reply:/nexttest2 <-- this must be '1' !!!

the_prog.pl is here:
#!/usr/bin/perl
$|=1;
$i=0;
open(LOG,">>/tmp/the_prog.log");
while (<STDIN>) {
print LOG "request:$_ reply:$_$i\n";
print "$_$i\n";
$i++;
}
close(LOG);
>Fix:
Don't see any way, but hard checking of the passed key string.
