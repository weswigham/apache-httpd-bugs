Hi,

My name is Faisal... as you know :)

I have made a module mod_scgi which is a combination of mod_include and mod_cgi, which can parse SSI in a CGI and multiple level of includes.... and it works pretty good.

Where do I need to send it in order for it to appear in Apcahe Modules set or the contributed page. I think it will ease lot of people's job... as it was a problem managing templates with CGI... and specially for the templates which use many SSI directives.

Thank you very much.

The first step would be to add your module to
the Apache Module Registry at http://modules.apache.org/
