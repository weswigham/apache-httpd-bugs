>Description:
OK, if I have a parsed file as follows:
<HTML>
..
<!--#include virtual="http://www.yourdomain.com/haha.html"-->
...
</HTML>
Apache tries to translate the URL of the document to include into a path which belongs to the local machine.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Well, kinda.
I noticed that the "include virtual" tag calls the following functions in this order:
handle_include()
  sub_req_lookup_uri()  (that's where the messup happens I guess)
  run_sub_req()   (that one returns 404, cause of the URL that gets previously built, has the url'd path directory of DocumentRoot 
at the beginning of the actual URL that we entered (this can be logged easily))
     invoke_handler()  (if you log inside this function, you will see the bad location already)

Problem is, I don;t understand well how a remote include would be handled, since for the request, 
there are certain items being copied (i.e. the server_rec, which, how in hell can you get it from the remote server ?)

I am open to suggestions or a simple bop in the head if I am doing something wrong in the html.
HHHAHAHAHAH

State-Changed-Why:
mod_include never has allowed for the inclusion of
remote documents, and likely never will.  It is very
difficult to implement well.

What you can do is use the proxy and a ProxyPass directive, eg.:

      ProxyPass /foobar http://www.remote-site/

and then use "include virtual=/foobar/file.html".

 Erm... I'm not sure what you mean.  It works fine for me.  Perhaps you
 don't have the proxy properly configured?

 Hey Marc;
 
 it works now, you were right.  It only works for straight directory, not
 files though.  interesting !!!.
 
 Anyway, I am building my own RSSI  HAHAHHAHA
 
 if you want me to keep you posted, just tell me.
 
 I am the WSF guy, and I have the "multi-IP   single-username"  module
 (which protects clubs from people sharing passwords)  and if you are
 interested, I could make this module available  (it involves one little
 function call being added in the "auth" modules)
 
 thanx for everything man
