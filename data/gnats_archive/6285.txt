Hi ! Before reading below text, know I just wish here to suggest a security enhancement. I have been forwarded finally to this form for this action.
There is no bug !
>Description:
Cheers,

chrooting Apache is very difficult, while the process needs some libraries, host may have different simultaneous configurations, or webhoster may wish to allow a chrooted tree for webmasters (ssh/telnet session in the documentroot tree).

When you chroot httpd process before launching it, a complete environment must be created for httpd, AND the user. Because of this, a httpd is necessary per webmaster, or a very complex situation involving links must be setup to simulate differents httpd.

But, if httpd when forking to user/group owner decides itself to chroot, all its libraries will be already loaded, and then it will need no extra data to work fine, until it is able to access the logs directory/files.

This is the suggestion. What do you think about a such feature ?
