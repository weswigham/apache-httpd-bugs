Origin200, IRIX 6.4, with gcc and cc
>Description:
As noted in two other apache bug reports in your database, apache 1.3.X
has a problem with semctl() on IRIX.

This is just to tell you that the problem only happens if compiled
with gcc (I'm using version 2.8.1). Apache works fine with the IRIX
cc compiler supplied with IRIX 6.4.

I'd also like to offer access to samba.anu.edu.au and samba2.anu.edu.au
for the Apache team. These two machines were donated by SGI and IBM
for free software development. I'd be happy to create an account for
a Apache developer if you think that would be useful (ssh access only).

samba.anu.edu.au is a Origin200 running IRIX 6.4

samba2.anu.edu.au is a dual processor RS/6000 running AIX 4.2

they have all the usual GNU tools installed plus the vendors
development environment.

I apologise that I am not providing you with a patch to fix the semctl
apache bug. I'm too busy with Samba bugs to look into it :)

use the IRIX compiler instead of gcc
