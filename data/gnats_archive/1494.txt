When I try to initiate the server, I'm getting the following message:

# /usr/local/apache-1.2.4/src/httpd -f /usr/local/apache-1.2.4/conf/httpd.conf
Syntax error on line 49 of /usr/local/apache-1.2.4/conf/access.conf:
<Location not allowed here

I looked at the "location.html" page on your web site.  I have the same entry
within the "access.conf" file.  The following lines are within the access.conf
file:

<Location /status>
SetHandler server-status
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from .champusa.com
</Location>

What gives? the only thing I can think of is permission problems.  I even
created a directory called /status with permissions set to nobody and nogroup.
Still does not work.  Can you provide me with the solution so that I can
run httpd?

Thank you for your prompt response.
Your time is greatly appreciated.
