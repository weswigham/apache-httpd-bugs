>Description:
The documentation for mod_include states:
Regular expressions have the same syntax as those found in the Unix egrep command.

However, in the gnu egrep manpage, there are two flavors of regular expressions: basic and extended.
I would love to see back references supported in Apache 1.x, this would make mod_include a lot more powerful. Using brackets you could match the information you are looking for and then set a variable with the the part of the string you matched.
>How-To-Repeat:
Back references example code. Enable mod_include for .shtml pages. Create a page x.shtml with the following content:

==================8<===============
<BODY>
<!--#if expr="'$HTTP_COOKIE' = '/name=(.*)/'"-->
name found in cookie!
<!--#set var="test1" value="\1" -->
<!--#set var="test2" value="$1" -->
<!--#else -->
no name found in cookie!
<!--#endif -->

<P>
<PRE>
<!--#printenv -->
</PRE>
==================8<===============
If you call the page and the HTTP_COOKIE contains "name=John"
you would see test1=John in the printenv output.
>Fix:
If back references would work in the above example, mod_include could be used to extract and display information from all the environment variables (QUERY_STRING, HTTP_COOKIE etc) without a need for mod_perl, php etc.
