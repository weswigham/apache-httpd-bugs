>Description:
When Apache/mod_proxy is used as a reverse proxy and directed with ProxyPassReverse to munge the Location header of a redirect, it always replaces the URL's scheme with that of the initial request. This happens because proxy_location_reverse_map() in modules/proxy/proxy_httpd.c calls ap_construct_url() from main/http_core.c to build the URL after changing the hostname and path, and ap_construct_url() gets the scheme from the ap_http_method macro.

This prevents, in the most likely example, redirection from an insecure to a secure URL. Note that I've tested 1.3.20 because that's the version that the current mod_ssl patches, and it's mod_ssl users who will probably have this problem, but 1.3.22 has the same bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a reverse proxy, then make the Web server redirect from http to https and request the http URL from the proxy.
>Fix:
Apply this patch to modules/proxy/proxy_httpd.c. (It only handles redirecting to http or https; a better solution would copy the scheme from the "real" partial URL in the ProxyPassReverse directive.)
