The Apache Bug database hasn't replied to my bug report yet so I can't
send you this extra info the correct way.  Sorry.  However I have found
a way to fix this problem.  Here's the patch...

Apache was changed between 1.2.4 and 1.3b3 to suppress the
"Proxy-Authorization" header field.  I'm not too sure why, but allowing
it through as before fixes the problem.
