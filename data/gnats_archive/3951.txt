>Description:
In a HTTP client code I wrote I send a dummy "Request 0-" header, in order to see if the server responds with 206 and so determine if the request is "restartable" at a later time. I noticed that Apache 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 respond with 200 OK, ignoring my dummy Range header. By comparing the source code of 1.2.6 and 1.3.4 I found this line in the parse_byterange function (http_protocol.c)
    return (*start > 0 || *end < clength - 1);

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Is this behavior intentional? I think Range 0- does not violate HTTP/1.1, so the code in my opinion should be
    return (*start >= 0 || *end <= clength - 1);

State-Changed-Why:

This behavior is intentional.  The 206 response interferes with
older caches and will not be sent if the response would include
the entire content.  200 is sent instead.

Your tool should be looking for the Accept-Ranges response
header field to see if the server allows range requests.
