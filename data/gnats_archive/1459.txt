>Description:
The "server seems busy" message gets generated often enough in my log files, 
that to have it be so long and wordy is a nuisence and makes it harder than
it should to pick out the information.  

How about a simplier one line format....like my suggested patch below?

BTW, thanks for the addition of the number of idle/total processes change
in the log output.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you post a sample of the warnings you're getting, and
your Start/Min/MaxSpareServers settings?

I really don't want to remove the extra descriptive text from
the message because it tells the user what parameters they
should consider changing... which will save support time.
But it's entirely likely that the warning is too sensitive,
or even that the spawning model is subtly wrong... which
is why it's there in the first place... so if you can provide
some data maybe we can figure out what's up.

Thanks
Dean

 No.  (well, not under the sockets API without hacking the kernel)

State-Changed-Why:
I won't be shortening the message because it's intended to be
self-documenting... 'cause folks just don't read manuals.
