>Description:
perchild.c:perchild_open_logs() uses the variables num_listensocks and pod which are not defined in the file.  Tracking this back in CVS, these references were added by rbb in CVS version 1.107.  This is still not fixed in the current CVS revision of the file 1.110.
>How-To-Repeat:
configure --with-mpm=perchild; make
>Fix:
This is the second time that I have found this type of mistake in perchild.c
in the past few beta releases.  This is not an OS-dependent bug.  There have been other patches to the file since the bug was introduced, but perchild.c could not have been compiled.  I would recommend that Apache development introduce a sanity check to at least compile Apache with each of the MPM configuration options available on Unix before making a Beta release.

>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Sun Mar 31 17:38:14 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
All of the compiler warnings and errors have been removed from the Perhild MPM.  However, it is very important to realize that the Perchild MPM is experimental, and very often it does not work.  Not having an working Perchild MPM is not considered a reason to hold-up a beta release.
