Linux loader1.csengineering.net 2.0.36 #1 Tue Oct 13 22:17:11 EDT 1998 i686 unknown
Red Hat Linux release 5.2 (Apollo)
gcc version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Configured apache with the APACI configure tool. During `make`, the section compiling the perl stuff gives the error:
/bin/bash: '../apaci' not found

This is surprisingly true. 'apaci' is in '../../apaci'
>How-To-Repeat:
By building mod_perl. Watch the output of the make when it hits the perl stuff
>Fix:
Since I not a makefile guru, I couldn't quite see where to adjust it, so I merely symlinked the file where the makefile wanted it to be.
