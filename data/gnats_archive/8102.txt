>Description:

When you request a out-of-range byterange on SSI file, the response will
put excess things after proper 416 error response head/body.

This is an forward port of PR#7636, which was "fixed" on 2.0.20
and reappeared on 2.0.21, by the modules/http/http_protocol.c:reset_filters()
modification.

The problem is identical as reported in PR#7636.

Analysis: The upstream filter (INCLUDES) trys to push on the content
buckets out to network even after the downstream filter (BYTERANGE)
has sent down an error bucket and sent out an error response.

INCLUDE----BYTERANGE----CONTENT_LENGTH----HEADER----[conn_filters]
           out of range,
           detach
           sends down 416 error bucket
                                     ap_die()
                                     reset_filter
                                     r->ot_filters = r->conn->ot_filters
                                     restack CONTENT_LENGTH,HEADER

INCLUDE-----------------CONTENT_LENGTH----HEADER---+[conn_filters]
 (416 err generator)----CONTENT_LENGTH----HEADER---+
                                                        sends down 416
                                                        return

INCLUDE-----------------CONTENT_LENGTH----HEADER---+[conn_filters]
rewind stack,
continue to push remaining data


The proposed patch below disassembles the old filter chain, assuming that
"upstream" filters are stacked before r->connection->output_filters.

It fixes the problem on hand but doesn't solve the real problem;
we should make a way to notify the upstream filters to terminate.

>How-To-Repeat:

[Requesting out-of-range byterange to http://dev.apache.org/;
 I guess this weird output is caused by the same problem.]

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Wed Aug  1 22:03:59 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
I have just committed a patch that makes mod_include honor
the return code from lower level filters.  The problem was
that the byterange filter was correctly returning the HTTP
status code 416, but mod_include was ignoring it.
