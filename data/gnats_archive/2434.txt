>Environment:
Linux 2.0.34 #6 i486
>Description:
While trying to upgrade to Apache 1.3.0 from 1.25 we are getting the
compilation errors in os.h "dlfcn.h: No such file or directory".
A serach of the system cannot find it at all, which means it
can't be part of the 2.0.30 or 2.0.34 distributions of Linux.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
What package is dlfcn.h available?
Add the dlfcn.h to the distribution under an OS specific directory
for include.

you can find by searching our bugdb.
