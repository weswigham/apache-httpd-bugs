>Description:
Logresolve only reads lines consisting of up to MAXLINE characters.
Resolving a logfile with long loglines resulted in more loglines in the
output file than in the input file. Logresolve should output the logline
unaltered except for the now resolved hostname.
>How-To-Repeat:
A logfile with a logline with more than MAXLINE characters.
>Fix:
The line length should not be a fixed length string.
