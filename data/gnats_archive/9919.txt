     WELCOME TO MIND MEDIA -- HOME OF PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE WEB
     by Bruce Ehrlich, Founder of the Mindware Catalog
     
     This is a special issue of the Mindware Review. The Mindware 
     Review is one of the longest running Internet newsletters --
     having sent out its first issue to subscribers in early 1995. The 
     publication is written by the Mind Media staff and is sent to a 
     subscriber list which has now grown to over 100,000. I am sending 
     it to you because you visited Mind Media Life-Enhancment Network
     so I know you are interested in what I call 
     Mindware. Please excuse me if I sent it to you in error, 
  
     Mind Media Review is about "Mindware" -- a term I coined back in 
     1988 to describe software that I had been collecting while I was 
     finishing my doctorate in P.M. Actually, just when I was going to 
     write my dissertation, I decided to start a small "side-business" 
     called the Mindware catalog. The 32 page color catalog grew from a 
     circulation of 5000 for issue mailed out in the spring of '88 to 
     500,000 mailed in the summer of 1994 -- our last issue. 
  
     In a strange twist, the first issue of the Mindware catalog was 
     called The Mindware Review -- which was the hot idea of a 
     marketing company I had hired to put out the first issue. When I 
     found out I could print 50,000 catalogs for about twice as much as 
     5,000, I left that company and found a local designer named Scott 
     Sandow who was a great layout artist but an also had been in 
     business and marketing his entire life. As someone who had come 
     from Grad School (I didn't know the difference between an invoice 
     and a purchase order), I was glad to have him spend hours with me 
     figuring out what this mindware thing was all about and who would 
     be interested in using it.
  
     This is an excerpt from the "Letter from the President" from that 
     second Mindware catalog.
  
     
         "Welcome to Mindware! An extra dimension has been 
         added to your personal computer with the arrival of a new 
         genre of software we call mind appliances. These mind 
         appliances cover many areas but share a common purpose: 
         the enhancement of human intelligence in all its aspects -
         - and so our name became,"Mindware."
 
         Mindware was conceived and created to be more than a 
         business in the normal sense. We sincerely believe that 
         anyone can benefit from this new relationship between computers 
         and the mind! 
  
     By the time we had grown to half a million catalogs, we were the 
     first catalog to have sold a CD-ROM drive along with CD-ROMs to 
     play in them and also the first to sell voice recognition 
     software. In a sense, we were kind of a "Sharper Image" of 
     computer software as well as a self- improvement catalog.
  
     One half-million catalogs costs a lot to mail. Our post office 
     bill was so large, I thought we should be given red carpet 
     treatment at the post office -- but we had to stand in line like 
     everyone else. Our team at Mindware was always dreaming of 
     starting something like America Online or even to be given a 
     section of AOL or than equally prominent CompuServe in order to 
     replace or at least supplement the catalog.
  
     My main assistant at the time,Thad Atkins had a couple of friends 
     who were starting a company to do catalogs on something called the 
     World Wide Web. When I ordered an ISDN line and started browsing, 
     I was sure that this was where I wanted real estate. So as the web 
     began to become more than just a place for scientists, we were one 
     of the earliest online. Our first web site was at mindware.com but 
     we decided to create a larger site called the Mind Media Life-
     Enhancement Network so that we could feature more than just the 
     Mindware Catalog Online.
  
     In 1995, we stopped printing catalogs and went entirely online. 
     The same year, I came out with the first email edition of the 
     Mindware Review. At the time there were only about a hundred 
     online newsletters and so were actually read and even enjoyed (I 
     got a lot of email asking questions when I wrote something which 
     is how I know).
  
     But by the end of the decade, the Internet revolution occurred --
     which actually made it more difficult for us in many ways. All of 
     the good programmers and web artists were suddenly working for 
     large corporations that formerly only had stores and advertised on 
     TV. Search engines were selling ranking -- and we didn't have the 
     money to pay. From less than twenty online catalogs that were 
     around when we started, now there were 200,000. Many of them 
     started what became known as the "dot comers" -- people who had 
     made money in other businesses and now were getting Venture 
     Capital which allowed them to out spend us by huge factors.
  
     Perhaps the one of the strangest stories of my twelve years in the 
     computer human potential business was an event that took place in 
     the fall of 1999. It was right in the middle of the Internet boom 
     -- when you drove through Silicon Valley and saw billboards from 
     VC companies. A woman called me. She told me that she had an 
     online art gallery but that her first love was personal 
     development -- the kind of products and services that we provide. 
     She then told me she represented someone in the "self-help" field 
     whose name I would instantly recognize. He had acquired a publicly 
     traded shell (a stock in which the company no longer exists but 
     which is still listed on a stock exchange -- a fast way of raising 
     public money is to buy one of these "shells" and put your company 
     and a few others together into it.). 
  
     She was looking for a few good personal development sites which 
     you could join together under this self-improvement figure. At one 
     point, she had me on the line with a gentleman who asked me what 
     my gross sales were. He had seen my business plan, which is posted 
     on our web site and mistakenly took our projections based on one 
     million dollars investment as our current earnings. When he found 
     out we weren't making the projected figure, he hurriedly got off 
     the phone.
  
     Who was the mysterious man? A few months afterward, Anthony 
     Robbins launched his high-profile web site -- Dreamlife.com. And 
     here is an excerpt from a January 10, 2000 Newsweek Magazine 
     (International Edition) --
     http://www.rickross.com/reference/general/general162.html --
     article:
  
         "This much is clear: if success is the goal, the gurus 
         have found it. Anthony Robbins leads the pack. Of all the 
         gurus, he's most focused on the Net. Last summer Robbins 
         took control of a publicly traded shell company whose 
         stock cost just pennies a share and announced plans to 
         build a self- improvement Web site, Dreamlife.com. The 
         site still isn't operational, but investors don't seem to 
         mind. Last week its stock stood at $16 a share, 
         putting Robbins's stake at more than $300 million."
  
     Well Robbins site was slick and "did everything right" -- from 
     personalized membership to an online interactive tutorial which 
     identified the parts of life that needed improvement, complete 
     with Tony Robbins voice and picture to guide you. I joined the 
     site and was bombarded with Newsletters on a daily basis. 
  
     Now in one of the business plans I wrote, before the Internet 
     became so fashionable -- I suggested that Mind Media approach 
     individuals such a Robbins, Deepak Chopra
  
     Stephen Covey. In "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and 
     John Gray, the former Hindu monk from right here in Mind Media 
     Country, Santa Cruz, California -- who wrote "Men Are From Mars, 
     Women Are From Venus," with the idea of Mind Media using its 
     expertise to give them a web presence. So when the VC money flowed 
     like wine and all of the big guys jumped aboard, little Mind Media 
     remained pretty much a slowly evolving web organism as it always 
     had been.
  
     Well  in  mid-2001, a year after its launch, Dreamlife.com was 
     dead. And Mind  Media is still here.. Back in 1990, one of the 
     software publishers I featured on in the Mindware Catalog, Bert 
     Shaw, sent me this quotation which still hands on my bulletin 
     board.
  
         "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. 
         Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful 
         men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is 
         almost a proconservation alone will not; the world is full 
         of educated derelicts."
  
     The saying had nobody it was attributed to, so I decided to look 
     it up on the web as I was wring this, I found out it was said by 
     good old "Silent" Calvin Coolidge himself, so I thought about 
     taking it down since he doesn't have much of a reputation] as he 
     had articulated an idea missed by many in the trendy self-
     improvement arena. 
  
     So this special issue is dedicated to the future of what I called 
     Mindware back in 1988. Its come a long way. In this issue, I'll 
     start with three free programs we give away on our site. Then I'm 
     going to take sections of two previous issues to introduce you to 
     five great downloads on the Web (not on our site) and five of the 
     best of the online applications And finally I'll put in a plug for 
     five of my favorite Mind Media Products.
  
     So I'm still carrying the torch Mindware. My dream is to make 
     our West into a portal dedicated to the use of computers 
     as mind appliances -- for individual success and personal development
     and the enhancement of the diverse aspects of human intelligence. 
     How is that for perseverance?

     THREE FREE SOFTWARE DOWNLOADS YOU THAT MAY CHANGE YOUR LIFE
     Here are three free software give-always from mind media They 
     all can be found on our "Specials Page" 
     http://www.mindmedia.com/specials.html.
  
     1) The first is the ever-popular Mindviewer -- a very close 
     follow up to the original Mind Prober which was published in the 
     mid-1980's:
     
     MINDVIEWER  GIVES YOU X-RAY VISION INTO ANYONE'S HIDDEN 
     PERSONALITY AND PRIVATE FANTASIES
  
     "Gain the advantage in personal and business relationships Reveals 
     the secrets of winning people's trust Developed by an eminent team 
     of psychologists "I was impressed by the reports it produced. In 
     fact, I thought it pegged me pretty darn close to how I perceive 
     myself. After showing the reports to a couple of close (and I mean 
     close) friends, they agreed with Mindviewer's analysis completely. 
     Of course I clipped out the section "Top Secret Sex Fantasies." --
     Ron Albright, Computer Shopper
  
     Uncover anyone's hidden personality with the best-selling self-
     improvement program of all time. After using Mindviewer, you will 
     feel like you have x- ray vision into parts of people that 
     normally they can keep hidden.
  
     People hide behind masks. With Mindviewer, you gain accurate 
     insight into the true nature of your friends, family, employees, 
     associates. Find out what makes them tick, what gets them angry--
     even how to shape their behavior. 
  
     Developed by Drs. James and Kathy Johnson, a renowned husband/wife 
     psychologist team, the program is both entertaining and 
     enlightening. And its analysis hits home in a big way.
  
     Using the program is simple, yet the complex psychometric 
     equations taken from personality psychology make the program 
     uncannily accurate. Mindviewer asks you a series of multiple-
     choice questions about yourself or someone you wish to know 
     better. Then you get a detailed profile of your subject, which can 
     be viewed on the screen or printed as a detailed 3-5 page report 
     custom-generated from the results. Run Mindviewer on your best 
     friends and see if you get some new angle on them. Run Mindviewer 
     on your boss for advice on important matters like how to get that 
     raise or next promotion. Or try the program on your spouse or 
     lover to reveal some hidden fantasies that just might warm up your 
     relationship.

     2) Another of our featured downloads is called Brainworks and it 
     helps you determine which hemisphere of the brain you use --left 
     or right or perhaps a bit of both.
  
     WHAT BRAIN HEMISPHERE DO YOU PREFER? ARE YOU MORE VISUAL OR 
     AUDITORY? DISCOVER YOUR PERSONALITY STYLE
  
     Do you know whether you prefer your left hemisphere or your right 
     hemisphere? When you think, do you think visually or in sounds? 
     The answer to these two key questions can unlock important secrets 
     to your personality. Secrets, which can give help you to become 
     more successful and effective in everything that you do.
  
     Mind Media Life Enhancement Network is pleased to give you, for a

     screen or print, how your unique preferences for right or left 
     hemisphere and for visual or auditory thinking styles make up your 
     unique personality style. But more important, you'll get guidance 
     and important tips on how you can be more effective in your 
     learning, in relating to others and in achieving your goals with 
     maximum success.

     The last is called IQ Smarts and it gives you four IQ scores 
     instead of one and helps you build your IQ by several points -- up 
     to 15 says the publishers.
  
     TURBOCHARGE YOUR BRAIN WITH IQ SMARTS MEASURE YOUR IQ - THEN RAISE 
     IT DRAMATICALLY RAISE YOUR IQ BY 15 POINTS OR MORE 
  
     Discover your hidden strengths At last, here is a computer program

     changing exercises are available with IQ SMARTS. IQ SMARTS begins

     FIVE SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD WEB SITES WORTH HAVING ON YOUR HARD DRIVE
  
     If you're at all like me, you love to download and try new 
     software. However as you might have discovered, you only really 
     find a few programs that you continue using and want to keep on 
     your hard drive. Today, I'm going to show some of the programs 
     that I kept on my computer.
  
     In addition to being winners, I have tried to choose programs from 
     a variety of different sub-categories of the genre that I call 
     "mindware." They are all worth a download.
  
     1. http://www.goalpro.com/index.cfm?ID=50571 The people who 
     publish GoalPro 5.0 calls it "The most effective success-
     management application available" and the funny thing is -- they 
     may be right! I've been working on a special feature article 
     covering my personal search trying to find the perfect program or 
     combination of programs to accomplish the increasingly difficult 
     task of managing my personal information. And GoalPro software in 
     tandem with Microsoft Outlook is the combo that I use. 
  
     But you don't have to use GoalPro on a PC. The people at GoalPro 
     have kept up with the state-of-the-art and are offering GoalPro 
     with most of its features intact as an on-line application. So 
     Macintosh and Linux users as well as anyone who has access to the 
     web can begin using GoalPro right now.
  
     What does the program do? Well it's hard to describe all of what 
     it does briefly and so next month this publication will have a 
     feature length review of GoalPro. In summary, it guides you 
     through the process of listing and clarifying your most important 
     life objectives.  You a set of concrete goals to reach each of 
     these objectives and also create short term tasks for reaching the 
     objectives and goals. 
  
     The program not only helps you create your "success tree" of 
     objectives, goals and tasks, it sets up a regular daily and 
     separate weekend routine where you visit these lists and determine 
     how you are doing. This is called Success Coach and it's pretty 
     darn useful. There's even a past-due management system where 
     people who set too many tasks or procrastinate -- - people such as 
     myself -- can evaluate and reschedule missed deadlines. Download a 
     free thirty-day trial -- you might want to keep using it.
  
     2. http://www.store-mindjet.com/affiliate.cfm?aff=PEZEVOBFQNFJ A 
     mind map is a visual representation of the relationship between 
     related ideas. The typical map starts with a central idea, word or 
     concept. Then, around the central word you draw five to ten main 
     ideas that relate to that word. You then take each of those child 
     words and again draw the five to ten main ideas that relate to 
     each of those words until you have an excellent visual model of 
     the idea you are trying to understand or express.
  
     MindManager 3.7 is perhaps the best tool for creating mind-maps 
     that has yet been devised, Whether you're trying to solve a 
     problem, prioritize your daily activities, organize multiple 
     projects or make a simple to-do list, MindManager will help. 
  
     Here's some of the wide range of uses for the program: you can 
     prepare speeches and presentations quickly and easily, plan and 
     track complex tasks and projects, share project information with 
     others, via MindManager's unique Internet conferencing, create web 
     sites and/or site maps using the web site export features, track 
     progress on projects visually, to quickly see how far along you 
     are, organize multiple projects at once, take notes efficiently 
     and easily reorganize them and more.
  
     Download a free full-featured demo -- or a smaller version which 
     downloads quicker and try it for 21 days.
  
     There are a wealth of resources on-line to help you learn the 
     skill of mapping your mind. So if you want the big picture, he's a 
     place to start drawing it. 
  
     3.http://www.brain.com Josh Reynolds's 
     Brain.com focuses on mental performance enhancement with its 
     premier thinkFast software. Now thinkFast is an on-line 
     application and brain.com has become an on-line brain-enhancement 
     community.
  
     In 1995,the Global Idea Bank listed my idea of the "mini- mind 
     gym" http://www.globalideasbank.org/BOV/BV-488.HTML. The principle 
     is that by using your brain, you can increase your mental fitness. 
     Mind Media's IQ Builder and thinkFast software featured on 
     brain.com work along these principles. They both give you a 
     variety of mental tests which focus on a spectrum of mental 
     abilities. By increasing the difficulty over trials, you "build 
     mental muscle."
  
     Now thinkFast has become an on-line application and added features 
     which take the idea of mental fitness workouts further.
  
     thinkFast is the perfect mind-mini gym and allows you to measure 
     and save your improvements on-line. It "works you out" on a wide 
     variety of mental skills. The program even includes your own 
     Personal Tutor who coaches you to greater mental heights. 
  
     4. http://www.acal.com  Stressmaster by Acel Self-Growth Software 
     is about more than just stress. Modules contained within this 
     ambitious Windows program include: Define Goals, Design Life, 
     Overcome Additions, Change My State of Mind, Calm Anger, Cope with 
     Daily Stress and several more.
  
     Some of the modules take you through interactive exercises that 
     help you deal with various problem areas. Each of the modules 
     written output is recorded in a master Self Discovery Journal. 
     This is one of the best of the growing number of programs aimed 
     toward self-therapy, StressMaster is available for a 30-day free 
     trial.
  
     5. http://brainstorming.org/ablemind/index.html  ThinkWorld's 
     Ablemind Streaming Idea Generator is the latest in the genre of 
     brainstorming software and works in conjunction with the company's 
     Brainstorming 101 seminar. You can download a demo version of the 
     program, which contains a subset of the program's 87 million idea 
     cards.
  
     The idea cards, which the program generates upon demand, consist 
     of three words - a verb adjective and a noun. For example here are 
     a few of the cards I drew: bevel postmodern shirts, lighten 
     leather cans, vibrate instant televisions,
  
     These phrases might seem a bit meaningless but they are there to 
     make you think. The company gives a few examples. Pump basketball 
     shoes, they say, would have made people laugh twenty years ago. 
     Now, after tens of millions of basketball shoes sold, people would 
     think the idea pure genius.  A few more examples among the 
     millions possible from Able's software: project Celluloid images, 
     navigate electronic documents. 
  
     Well the arguments pretty convincing that this software can make 
     me money. I'm going to file my patent for a
     vibrating instant television tomorrow.

      FIVE MINDWARE ONLINE APPLICATIONS YOU CAN VISIT TODAY
      by Bruce Eisner
  
     The Internet is always issuing new and trendy buzzwords and so you 
     have probably started hearing that the next wave on the Web is 
     online applications. In fact, online applications have arrived and 
     will revolutionize the way that you will use the interactive self-
     improvement and personal-development tools which is the essence of 
     the meaning of this new genre of Mindware tools.
  
     Since the beginning of personal computing, there have always been 
     a number of competing operating systems which you can chose from 
     to run your PC. In the past twenty years CPM, OS/2, the BeOS, the 
     Macintosh, many flavors of UNIX along with several flavors of 
     Windows. It has been a situation akin to the Biblical tower of 
     Babel and so computer users for the most part chose Windows along 
     those "who think different" picking the Mac. And the third most 
     popular desktop operating system, Linux.
  
     Many people have chose Windows as an operating system because 
     there are hundreds of times as many applications made for it than 
     for the Mac or Linux or the others. Most computer users have 
     dreamed of a day when it didn't matter what operating system you 
     ran, you could use whatever application you wanted on any 
     computer. Online applications are rapidly making this dream a 
     reality. 
  
     Online applications are built to work within a computer browser so 
     that the application runs on the web server and any web-enabled 
     computer can use them. In addition to their universality of use, 
     these applications can also be upgraded by system administrator of 
     the web server, virtually eliminating the need to constantly buy 
     and install upgrades to every one of your software applications.
  
     Confined at first to a small group of mainstream software 
     applications such as accounting software, utilities, online 
     greeting card generators and the like, online applications are now 
     becoming available for the kind of software that I like to write 
     about.
  
     So here are five web online applications worth a visit. I've 
     written about some of them before and their here again because 
     they help broaden the range of possible scope of what you can look 
     at today. 
  
     Five Self-Improvement Online Applications worth a Visit 
     
     1.http://www.living-software.com The first personal 
     development online application I'm going to review is by an 
     Israeli team headed by C.E.O Doron Zzur. The link above is to a 
     beta of the most sophisticated self-therapy tool created for the 
     computer and it runs on any machine you care to try it on!
  
     After registering, the program prompts you with the question, "How 
     Do You Feel Today." You answer by writing down what psychologists 
     are fond of calling "your issues" and then you are introduced to 
     four helpers in cartoon form. You can choose any of them and they 
     will converse with you and help you clarify your problem and think 
     about it in different terms. 
  
     Each of the helpers is a different kind of personality and can 
     give advices, which might even contradict the other very different 
     personality. By then noting changes as they occur, you involve 
     yourself in an ongoing process. This process can lead to 
     improvements in attitude and mood as the brainstorming helps you 
     become familiar with your "issue." And with familiarity comes 
     relief by looking at something you here-to-fore avoided.
  
     This is a beta and has some rough edges but the good part is that 
     it is free. Also information collected will help to make this site 
     even better. Eventually Mr. Dzur hopes to turn this into a paid 
     service. He was inspired to go into this line of work by a very 
     significant personal crisis in his life, which occurred after his 
     wife passed away with cancer several years ago. He founded this 
     company to make available to the public ways of quickly responding 
     to stressful life crises. His company has board of consulting 
     psychologists and the site is worth a visit or several.
  
     2. http://app.brain.com/member/join.cfm Josh Reynolds's 
     Brain.com focuses on mental performance enhancement with its 
     premier thinkFast software. Now thinkFast is an online application 
     and brain.com has become an online brain-enhancement community.
  
     In 1995,the Global Idea Bank listed my idea of the "mini- mind 
     gym" http://www.globalideasbank.org/BOV/BV-488.html was listed 
     for voting.The basic principle is that by using your brain, 
     you can increase your mental fitness by exersing it, just as you
     do physical muscles.
     
     Mind Media's IQ Builder and thinkFast software featured on 
     brain.com work along these principles. They both give you a 
     variety of mental tests, which focus on a spectrum of mental 
     abilities. By increasing the difficulty over trials, you "build 
     mental muscle."
  
     Now thinkFast has become an online application and added features, 
     which take the idea of mental fitness workouts further.
  
     ThinkFast is the perfect mind-mini gym and allows you to measure 
     and save your improvements online. It "works you out" on a wide 
     variety of mental skills. The program even includes your own 
     Personal Tutor who coaches you to greater mental heights. 
  
     3.http://www.goalpro.com/index.cfm?ID=50571 I've written a lot in 
     June and July about GoalPro - which I consider one of the most 
     helpful software programs I've used to help me organize for 
     success.  I'm featuring it here again because you've got to look 
     around the site to find that in addition to the software version, 
     there's an online version of GoalPro you can purchase as a 
     subscription which allows anyone including Mac and Linux users to 
     use this significant program. Here's what I wrote in June:
  
     The people who publish GoalPro 5.0 calls it "The most effective 
     success management application available" and the funny thing is -
     - they may be right! GoalPro software in tandem with Microsoft 
     Outlook is the combo that I use. But you don't have to use GoalPro 
     on a PC. The people at GoalPro have kept up with the state-of-the-
     art and are offering GoalPro with most     of its features intact 
     as an online application. So Macintosh and Linux users as well as 
     anyone who has access to the web can begin using GoalPro right 
     now.
  
     What does the program do? Well it's hard to describe all of what 
     it does briefly and so next month this publication will have a 
     feature length review of GoalPro. In short, it guides you through 
     the process of listing and clarifying your most important life 
     objectives.  You list a set of concrete goals to reach each of 
     these objectives and also create short term tasks for reaching the 
     objectives and goals. 
  
     The program not only helps you create your "success tree" of 
     objectives, goals and tasks, it sets up a regular daily and 
     separate weekend routine where you visit these lists and determine 
     how you are doing. This is called Success Coach and it's pretty 
     darn useful. There's even a past-due management system where 
     people who set too many tasks or procrastinate can evaluate and 
     reschedule missed deadlines. Download a free thirty-day trial - -
     you might want to keep using it -- I did.
  
     4. http://www.timecontrol.cc Panella Strategies: Success-Centered 
     Time Management Power and Power Marketing Principles is not an 
     exactly an online application but I put it here because it relies 
     on the multimedia capabilities of the web to deliver an extensive 
     library of time management principles developed by Vince Panella. 
     During the past 18 years, his profit and time-building programs 
     have influenced thousands of companies and tens of thousands of 
     people in 25 countries around the world. The application- like 
     section is called the Time Control Room and it has series of 
     modules which take several days to learn (Panella finds that most 
     people who take other time management courses don't learn anything 
     because they are presented two quickly so they are forgotten just 
     as quickly. Real Audio lectures by Vince Panella are supplemented 
     by written materials available for download and the program 
     together works very well.  The cost is $20 per month but readers 
     of this column can email mailto:psi@accelernet.net  and get yearlong
 
     subscription for only $49.95 if you mention that Robert Galpren, 
     Editor-In-Cheif from the Mind Media review sent you. 
  
     5.http://www.ansir.com -- Ashir.com is more than a web site, it is 
     one premier example of Mindware online app. Ashir.com starts with 
     a personality test which uses a unique system called the Ansir 
     Style of Relating. You take the test after registering and are 
     rated on 14 different personality attributes. Here is what they 
     say about their test. "Discover your Self- truth and potential! 
     It's free, challenging, and enlightening! But be warned, this 
     serious test has 2,744 possible combinations and is ranked-by 
     participants and Members alike-among the toughest and most 
     accurate on the Web. Self-honesty is key. Read Profile Briefs 
     first, then learn much, much more with Profiles In Depth 
     absolutely free! Once you take the test, you are presented with a 
     unique perspective on yourself and also become part of the 
     Asir community. It is fun, fascinating and most of all - worth a
 visit.
