Installed by the MSI installer, without source.

CGI programs are compiled C++ using MS VC6, SP5.  Source has been compiled and is running on linux / solaris systems without problems.
>Description:
CGI programs (C++, has work successfully in pervious versions of apache and other web protocols and across different platforms) have stopped being able to read the cin correctly.  Cout works, and (reputedly) cerr doesn't go to an error log.

cin.read(data, CONTENT_LENGTH) fails, although CONTENT_LENGTH is set correctly.

Others have posted this problem to the usenet groups (unix incidently) without answer.
>How-To-Repeat:
The code I am having difficulty with is the 'XCC homepage' (http://xcc.tiberian.com/, http://sourceforge.net/projects/xccu) which is a forum script in C++.  You can get a binary version from xcc.tiberian.com/downloads/, and the source from sourceforge.  But it is not the source that seems to be the problem.
>Fix:
I am guessing that the stdin, stdout and stderr (cin, cout etc for this code) need to be piped properly.  Would have thought something like that would be OS-specific (I haven't studied the apache source), but this seems to have affected unix users too.

Simply, is there a previous version of apache where this functionality is working which I can install to get things going quickly?

PS: thnks for all your hard work!

Comment-Added:
About your read error, no, the content length is wrong,
since it counted CR/LF pairs as 2 bytes, but you are
likely reading them as single LF's (that little MS majic),
I'd suggest you ensure cin is treated as a binary stream.

As for the printing to stderr, we will investigate further.
Thanks for your report and interest in the apache httpd
project!
