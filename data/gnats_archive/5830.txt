>Description:
I may not be including a necessary module (I've looked around for what I'm missing but haven't seen anything).

Here's the errors I'm getting:

Syntax error on line 670 of c:/program files/apache group/apache/conf/httpd.conf
:
Invalid command 'MetaDir', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not includ
ed in the server configuration

Syntax error on line 676 of c:/program files/apache group/apache/conf/httpd.conf
:
Invalid command 'MetaSuffix', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not inc
luded in the server configuration

Syntax error on line 187 of c:/program files/apache group/apache/conf/httpd.conf
:
Invalid command 'ExtendedStatus', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not
 included in the server configuration
>How-To-Repeat:
I installed the win32 version, took the comment (#) in front of these commands out (individually), and tried to start the service with
apache -n "my_service_name"
If I add the -k start to it, it still gives an error, but it doesn't say what the error is.  I can run the service fine if I just comment these lines out (which is what I'm doing right now).

State-Changed-Why:

These conf options all require the appropriate module to
already be loaded.  You will find a list of the distributed
loadable modules (such as status_module for the directive
ExtendedStatus) all listed in the LoadModules section, all
commented out until you choose to uncomment and use them.
