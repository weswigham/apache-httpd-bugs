>Unformatted:
This problem has been solved. As predicted, it was either going to be something really trivial, or something really obscure. It was trivial:

Despite many hours careful checking of everything, the shebang line to the Perl executable, which should have read

#!C:\PERL\5.00502\bin\MSWin32-x86-object\perl.exe

in fact read

#!C:\PERL\5.005002\bin\MSWin32-x86-object\perl.exe

That's all.  Everything now appears to run OK, and I look forwards to happy programming on a great, free, system.
