>Description:
In my installation the follow is found in apxs after make install:

y $CFG_TARGET        = q(httpsd);            # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_CC            = q(gcc);                # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_CFLAGS        = q( -DLINUX=2 -DTARGET="httpsd" -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I../lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED -DAPACHE_SSL `../apaci`);
        # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = q();      # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = q();          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q(); # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LIBS_SHLIB    = q();        # substituted via Makefile.tmpl

This means the following variables were not set when configure got there... 
CFLAGS_SHLIB  LD_SHLIB LDFLAGS_MOD_SHLIB LIBS_SHLIB
my $CFG_PREFIX        = q(/usr/local/apache-1.3.14);            # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_SBINDIR       = q(/usr/local/apache-1.3.14/bin);           # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_INCLUDEDIR    = q(/usr/local/apache-1.3.14/include);        # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = q(/usr/local/apache-1.3.14/libexec);        # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_SYSCONFDIR    = q(/usr/local/apache-1.3.14/conf);        # substituted via APACI install
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know if you can repeat it by I suspect so.  

I down loaded Ben Laurie's tarball - apache_1.3.14+openssl_1.42 adn built it against openssl_0.9.6
>Fix:
I can try to go through the autoconf and configuration if and fix this if someone who is more familiar can give me some idea where to start.

Also - I can place the tarballs in the anon ftp server.

Finally - if someone can give me an idea what these variables should be set to I'll just fix my copy for now.  This won't set me back for long.
