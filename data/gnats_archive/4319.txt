>Description:
While compiling PHP3 following failure-msg is presented:

In file included from functions/adabasd.h:65,
                 from internal_functions.c:79:
/opt/adabas/incl/WINDOWS.H:110: conflicting types for `BOOL'
../apache_1.3.6//src/include/httpd.h:70: previous declaration of `BOOL'
make: *** [internal_functions.o] Error 1

In Apache 1.3.4+SSL there is no "BOOL" in the httpd.h
>How-To-Repeat:
Get Apache 1.3.6+SSL (newest version), PHP 3.0.7, ADABAS D 6.1.15.51 and compile
PHP3 like this:
./configure --with-apache=../apache_1.3.6/ --with-adabas=/opt/adabas --enable-track-vars --with-mysql --disable-unified-odbc
After typing "make" the error message appears.
I will also send a mail into the PHP3 Mailinglist.
>Fix:
No..Sorry..

State-Changed-Why:

Why your configuration is including a Windows header file
on Linux (/opt/adabas/incl/WINDOWS.H) seems pretty
mysterious.  Regardless, the symbol BOOL is not defined
by any Apache files, so it must be coming from some system
header file or something in the Apache-SSL patches.  There's
nothing we can do about this, sorry.
