>Environment:
RedHat 6.0, JDK 1.1.6v5, Oracle 8.1.5
>Description:
I got JServ working, then I tried a servlet using JDBC. When it executes 
    // Load the Oracle JDBC driver
    DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());
I get a CLASS NOT FOUND in jserv.log. It is the same when I set the classpath in jserv.properties
or copy the classes111.zip-file (jdbc classes) to e.g. /usr/local/jdk116/lib/

Do you have any hint or idea?

Knut
