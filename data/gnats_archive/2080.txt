>Environment:
SunOS tucows.turboline.be 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
gcc version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Given the following excerpt of a httpd.conf file

  <VirtualHost w.z.x.y>  
  DocumentRoot /document/root
  DirectoryIndex index.html  index.htm default.html default.htm /cgi-bin/index.pl
  ServerName www.somedomain.be
  ErrorLog logs/wtl_error_log
  TransferLog logs/wtl_access_log
  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /shared/www/cgi-bin

  <Location ~ "^/$">
  order deny,allow
  allow  from all
  </Location>

  <Location ~ "^/.+">
  order allow,deny
  allow from a.b.c
  </Location>

  </VirtualHost>

The idea is to let everyone access "http://www.somedomain.com/" (by executing the
/cgi-bin/index.pl script) and let only people with IP adresses a.b.c access the
rest of the site. Configured like this (with virtualhost) it doesn't work.
When configured without virtualhost this works as expected
>How-To-Repeat:
If needed I can set up a test site with a few simple pages
