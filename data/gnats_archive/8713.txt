>Description:
I have installed Apache1.3.19 with JServ and Tomcat.

"Include /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-apache.conf" 
First i have started Tomcat.It has started.
When i say "./apachectl start" to start Apache
I get the Error as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must specify a secret key, or disable this feature.

To disable, add "ApJServSecretKey DISABLED" to your Apache configuration file.

To use, add "ApJServSecretKey {filename}" where filename is document

with more or less random contents, and perhaps a few kb in length.

The Apache JServ documentation explains this in more detail.

/opt/apache1/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to resolve this problem?
Can you give me detail solution for it?
Its very urgent for my project.
