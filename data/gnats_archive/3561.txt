>Unformatted:
When I try to load Proxy module into server this message appears:

Syntax error on line 30 of /apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /apache/modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll into server


When I try to load any other module (which is also individual DLL)
I have no problem - everything is OK. But Proxy..

I found this is known as PR#1462 problem in Nov 1997.  Is there
any solution of this problem, is there any fix? Do I some mistake
in conf files?

If You can, please help me...   Thanks.
