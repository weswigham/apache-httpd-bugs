>Description:
Is it possible to put several require Lines into a LIMIT environment like:

<directory /blabla>
<limit get post>
require user ajung
require group mygroup
</limit>
</directoy>

I tried this however Apache logged when I used my account name "ajung"
that I'm not member of the right group. The documentations does not say
that there may be only one require statement.

State-Changed-Why:
No, that is not possible.  As the docs for the satisfy directive
say, it controls if hostname/IP authentication is needed
in addition to user authentication or if just one is needed.

a require user and require group statement mean both are
needed.

 Right now, as far as I can think, you can't.  Yes, it is a shortcoming.
