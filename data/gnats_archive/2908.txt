>Description:
I'm trying to see if an url is a broken link. But when I access an Apache Server I get a 403 Forbidden Error from the server.
If I open the url with a browser, I could get well the url.

Via telnet:
telnet 2000kva.com 80
...
GET / HTTP/1.0
[Server Response]
...
403 Forbidden
...

Must I put anything else in the request??

I get the same response in many Apache Servers (vs. 1.2.4 and 1.2.5)

Another url that I get the same result is : www.gasconysons.com

Any suggests???

Thanks in advance

State-Changed-Why:
This really isn't the most appropriate place to ask this; it
would be appreciated if you could follow the directions about trying other
places (eg. Usenet) first.

The reason is that you aren't sending a Host: header
(eg. Host: 2000kva.com) with your request and the sites in
question are using name-based virtual hosting.

On Netscape: the response is well!!
