Server:
Microsoft Windows 2000 (5.00.2195)
Oracle iAS 9i
Apache HTTP Server 1.3 (bundled with iAS 9i)
Apache JServ (bundled with iAS 9i)

Client:

Netscape 6
>Description:
When a request is made for a JSP from Netscape 6 (error occurs only when the client is Netscape 6) over HTTPS the response times out and on the server a window pops up with the following message:

Apache.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows.
You will need to restart the program.
An error log is being created.
