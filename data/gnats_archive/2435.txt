>Environment:
I filed this under 'os-other' because I can get it to fail on multiple UNIX OSs:

Sun: SunOS sparc 4.1C 4.1.3 sun4
NCR SysV: UNIX_SV si699 4.0 3.0 4850 386/486/MC
>Description:
Trying to create shadow trees on SunOS and NCR SysV, the GNUTRIPLE always 
came out null. I traced it to 'sed's inability to cope with the single line
input (the non-newline terminated result from awk) on the sed substitute 
command. I'd blame it on the OS if it weren't for the fact that this was 2 
unrelated systems.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following fails on both systems:

$ src/helpers/GuessOS|nawk '{printf("%s",$1);}' | sed -ne '1p'
$ src/helpers/GuessOS|nawk '{printf("%s\n",$1);}' | sed -ne '1p'
sun4-sun-sunos4
$
>Fix:
I just removed the sed command from the GNUTRIPLE call, but that may not work 
for other GuessOS results. A better fix may be to swap the order of the sed 
and the awk/nawk:

$ src/helpers/GuessOS| sed -ne '1p'|nawk '{printf("%s",$1);}'

Thanks for the report. I've now swaped awk and sed
in the command as you suggested for Apache 1.3.1.

Adding info from PR#2740:

From: Bill Houle <bhoule@sparc.sandiegoca.ncr.com>

The 1.3.0 bugfix I supplied was only applied to one instance of
configure's GuessOS|sed|awk, though there are 2 instances within 
the --shadow section. The other line in the 1.3.1 release needs 
to be fixed also.

State-Changed-By: rse
State-Changed-When: Sun Aug  2 04:22:16 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Both entries in configure are now fixed for Apache 1.3.2.
At both positions inside the script SED and AWK are
not swapped.
