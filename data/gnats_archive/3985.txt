Now I want the count.cgi produce a counter for the number of visits.
Report.cgi produces a report on the incoming visit.
Both cgi output goes directly into the current webpage.

However, nothing appear on the webpage at that cgi execution place.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Is there any alternative for such approach? In other words, how can a
user execute a short cgi script to produce server filtered output.

 Docs without points to make have been read. Do not see any indication about what 
 to put there. What would you put there then?
