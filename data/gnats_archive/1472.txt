Solaris 2.5.1, gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
This is a problem that I've encountered also with netscape proxy so it may NOT
be a bug but is certainly undesired behaviour.  I have a firewall that uses TIS
Gauntlet httpd proxy on an "outside" machine and an Apache proxy server on
the "inside."  The inside is set up to ProxyRemote to the gauntlet server.  The
problem occurs on POST methods.  From IP snoops, the data coming back from the
TIS httpd is complete (with HTTP/1.0 200 OK header and all others) yet, it
appears as though apache inserts _another_ HTTP/1.0 200 OK in front of the data
sent to the client, which results in the rest of the headers being displayed as
part of the page.
>How-To-Repeat:
Dual proxy configuration with POST's _should_ reproduce it.
>Fix:
Looking at the source right now to determine why this is occurring

it's been a couple months now... did you determine what was

haven't seen any other reports of this.

 Sorry, I should have closed this out.  Strangely, it could have been partly
 apache's fault (although I could find no indication in the source) but
 it was an interaction with TIS Gauntlet 4.0's http proxy.  
 
 Cheers,
