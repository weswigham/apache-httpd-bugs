Hi, sorry if this is not the correct location for this observation, 
but I thought you should know that I got here by trying to see if the Vatican had a web site; yes:  
Http://www.vatican.com dropped me almost instantaneously on what appears to be your dist.site for V1.3
Running Netscape Comminicator 4.51, Win 95 OEMSR2.1, AMD K6-2-300 and 64 meg 
dimm, Matrox MGA-200(16meg) and 10gig Seagate Medallist Pro(7200rpm); 
Tyan m/b s1590 Trinity AT, 100mhz front-end bus and bus-mastering 
HD controller.
 
>Description:

>How-To-Repeat:
see above for web address to enter
>Fix:
