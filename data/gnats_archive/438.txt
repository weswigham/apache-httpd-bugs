AIX 4.2
gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
To my primary IP-address 1.2.3.2 I defined 3 alias-addresses with ifconfig
command showing below too:
ifconfig en0 1.2.3.3 netmask 255.255.255.224 alias
ifconfig en0 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.224 alias
ifconfig en0 1.2.3.5 netmask 255.255.255.224 alias

1.2b7:
I want that apache should listen to 1.2.3.3:80, 1.2.3.4:80 and 1.2.3.5:8000
and not to any other port else!

Therefore I tried the config
Listen	1.2.3.3:80
Listen	1.2.3.4:80
Listen	1.2.3.5:8000

A call of httpd gives "httpd: could not bind to address 1.2.3.5 port 8000"
A different sequence of Listen-directives alway be replied with ip-address
and port number of the last Listen directive.

Listen	80
Listen	8000

works but does not do what I want.

An upgrade to 1.2b8 gives that you can start httpd with the first Listen-
directives sequence. but httpd dies silently after approx. 2 hours.

State-Changed-Why:
Andreas, when you say dies silently do you mean the process
actually exits, or it just stops responding?

If it stops responding could you try adding
-DUSE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to your EXTRA_CFLAGS and
rebuilding.  Actually you should try this anyhow, there
is a bug with multiple Listens which we are adding to the
known_bugs page shortly.

Thanks

Haven't heard back in a while, assuming the serialised accept
defines fixed the problem.
