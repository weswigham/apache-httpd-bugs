>Description:
I've got 2 ordinary VirtualHosts (name based test1.network.net test2.network.net (192.168.1.10))
and in both webhotels i got a index.html


         <HTML>
         <HEAD>
         <TITLE> A Simple Program </TITLE>
         </HEAD>
         <BODY>

         Here is the output of my program:
         <APPLET CODE="test1.class" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=25>
         </APPLET>
         </BODY>
         </HTML>
(on test2.network.nets index.html i have done a s/test1.class/test2.class/g)
if i go to test1.network.net it works just fine 
if i then go to test2.network.net (withour closing my browser or etc) my netscape and IE
says that it cant find test2.class file 
and in test1.network.net accesslog i see that http process was looking for test2.class in test1.network.nets homedirectory


It works just fine if I clear my cache before i go to test2.network.net or if test1.network.net and test2.network.net have 
seperate ip numbers
