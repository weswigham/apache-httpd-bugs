>Description:
Hi, Just trying to build apache 1.3.22 from source, so I can add mod_ssl to it. Retrieved the current zip file from the apache.org site. Unzip it will no errors. The "configure" file does not have the execute bit set. So I set it (or run it via "sh"):

linux/apache_1.3.22 # sh configure
: command not found
: command not found
: command not found
'onfigure: line 102: syntax error near unexpected token `in
'onfigure: line 102: `case "$*" in

Sorry if this is something obvious, but I couldn't find it. Is it a problem with the contents of the zip file?
