State-Changed-Why:
Your report gives no details of the actual bug, if any,
in apache... and version 1.2.4 is quite old indeed.  If
you can tell us the exact exploit we can probably tell you
we've fixed it.

Thanks
Dean

Hello,

I found a security bug in the Apache 1.2.4 ( ntx enhanced server - 
referer/agent 1.0d6 ). This may lead to root compromise if the right
files are in place.

This is the mail that I sent to NTX.net who adapted the Apache 1.2.4
architecture to their system:


Hi,

As a security analyst, I've been studying your Apache NTX Enhanced
WebServer System. In doing this, I was trying to find holes in your 
security. I just wanted to let you know that I did find one.

It seems that anyone can have read access to the remote server's cgi-bin 
directory. This can lead to compromise of the remote machine if certain 
cgi's are found on the system. 

I found this hole by doing a security check on one of the sites you 
host. The site in question is www.estock.com. By utilizing NetCraft's 
(www.netcraft.com) WebServer Check I noticed that www.estock.com is 
running Apache/1.2.4 ( ntx enhanced server - referer/agent 1.0d6 ).

This means that this server is vulnerable to breaches in security. 
Properly exploited, these breaches on the cgi-level of security could 
lead to a root compromise of your entire system.

I would be happy to discuss this and/or other matters of security with 
you. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best regards,
