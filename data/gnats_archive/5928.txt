>Description:
Note - this is related to bug reports 3658 and 4087 - space processing in ftp
file names.

If you access a site with a file directory which looks like Directory of ftp://205.227.44.220/apps/outgoing/12788631.600/
     _________________________________________________________________

total 454
drwxr-xr-x   2 10              96 Mar 20 15:49 .
drwxrwxrwx  7591 21          197632 Mar 25 15:29 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 0            26480 Mar 20 15:49 451786.1070t.Z

default apache displays the directory entry as:

Directory of ftp://205.227.44.220/apps/outgoing/12788631.600/            
     _________________________________________________________________

total 454
drwxr-xr-x   2 10              96 Mar 20 15:49 .
drwxrwxrwx  7591 21          197632 Mar 25 15:29 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 0            26480 Mar 20 15:49 4 1786.1070t.Z
     _________________________________________________________________

Note the corruption in the file name.

THis problems is caused by the file name space processing located in send_dir
around line 368.  The code as written incorrectly identifies the starting location of the file name area because the previous line's directory size forced
a reformat (shifting) of the file name (..).

Temporary fixe - simply remove the space processing code (which break that part).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Improved parsing of the line is required to properly identify the start of the file.  This requires the code to be aware of all ftp servers NLST command processing.  If one can assume that they are all of the form

mode (directory, link, file), permissions, # links, group, size, file name
this could be parsed off directly - front to back - and then properly identify the file name.
