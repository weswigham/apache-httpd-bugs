httpsd complained about its inability to serialize access to the ports.  
So I read PORTING, and did the following small change.  In the 
src/include/ap_config.h I added 
#define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
in #elif defined(ULTRIX) ... #endif bracket.  No complains, 
httpsd starts and works OK.
(Checked with Ben Laurie about "s" part - I use apache-ssl - and 
he confirmed that it is apache problem, not apache-ssl problem).
