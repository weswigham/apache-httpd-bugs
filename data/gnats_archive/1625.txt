>Environment:
DEC Unix 3.2g native compiler
>Description:
I've got several virtual server based on names (not IP)
My first server www.web-data.fr has got a srm.conf with alias (eg. /announce/)
but all the others virtual servers may access to this (ex www.supramed.fr)

There is no command to unalias theses global aliases
>How-To-Repeat:
original URL http://www.web-data.fr/announce/
virtual server http://www.supramed.fr/announce/
I try to make specific srm.conf for each server but it didn't change anything
>Fix:
Add an unalias command to the mod_alias module for the virtual server

State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Sat Jan 10 04:25:23 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:

Most main server settings are inherited by the
virtual hosts... that is the way Apache is designed
to work.

If you don't like or need this behaviour you can 
strip down the configuration of your main server to
a minimum and create a <VirtualHost> section for  
your 'default' server.
Please see the vhost-documentation for details.
