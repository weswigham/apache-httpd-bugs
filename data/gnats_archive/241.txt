>Description:
The HTTP specs provide for parameters for the Content-Type header:

       media-type     = type "/" subtype *( ";" parameter )

e.g.

       text/html; charset=ISO8859-2

With Apache, only the first blank delimited token is accepted in the AddType directive,
any additional paramters are ignored (actually taken as - rather unlikely - extensions).
Omitting the blank before the parameters breaks some existing browsers.

None of the workarounds - asis documents and Action handlers - is nice as some of the
server's functionality is lost when serving documents that way (such as, SSI, If-Modified-Since).

>How-To-Repeat:
AddType text/html; charset=ISO8859-2  html
>Fix:
As it is very unlikely people have configured extensions like charset=ISO8859-2, a change to
interpret anything with an equals sign as parameter would improve the functionality while
at the same time maintain compatibility pretty well.%0

State-Changed-Why:
It is too late to get this into Apache 1.2, so I am suspending
this report so it can be considered for inclusion in the
next release.  Thank you for the report.

State-Changed-Why:
With Apache 1.2, you can use the following and it
should have the desired effect:

  AddType "text/html; charset=ISO8859-2" html

Please try that and let me know if it does/doesn't
solve your problem.  (You'll need to upgrade to
Apache 1.2.)

Thanks for using Apache!

State-Changed-Why:
Media types can be enclosed in double-quoted strings,
so can include spaces if necessary. This answers
the original bug report.
