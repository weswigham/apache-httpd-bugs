>Description:
The apache is running on cluster of Solaris servers, load to the individual machines is distributed by switches. The apache works fine when RewriteLogLevel for Virtualhost is set to 0. When I increase logging level, the pages are downloaded very slow (I mean _real_ very slow). Standard case is that test page with html code is downloaded ok, but pictures are very slow.
>How-To-Repeat:
Right now hte logging is off, sot the problem cannot be repeated, but I can prepare a site for test.
