>Environment:
Windows 95, binary distribution, not running as service (of course)
>Description:
When I try to do something like this :
cd \www\_apache
Apache.exe -s -f windows\conf\httpd.conf

or the same with full paths, I get the following error :

[Wed May 27 18:31:23 1998] file .\os\win32\util_win32.c, line 120, assertion "sz
Path[1] == ':' || szPath[1] == '/'" failed

When I run Apache without this switch, everything works. This worked in Apache 1.3b3...
>How-To-Repeat:
I hope, that just adding -d or -f switch would do.
>Fix:
no

State-Changed-Why:
Try using forward slashes, such as

  Apache.exe -s -f windows/conf/httpd.conf
or
  Apache.exe -s -d windows

and see whether it's any happier.
