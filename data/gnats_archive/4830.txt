>Description:
It would be nice if the time that mod_jserv allows the servlet engine to finish
shutting down on a shutdown request was user configurable.  I have a servlet 
that spends up to three minutes serializing data to a file when it is destroyed 
- if I shutdown, the servlet engine is killed before it has a chance to finish.  
I'd like to be able to tell mod_jserv to allow 3 minutes before it kills the 
servlet engine.  Thanks.
