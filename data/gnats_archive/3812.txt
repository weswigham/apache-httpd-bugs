BSD/OS 3.1

External JavaScript Files are still being displayed as text instead of being parsed into the
3.x browsers. The mime.types file has been edited to reflect this. Since this version has a 
FrontPage extension loaded has this brought about other files to edit??

 Problem Synopsis:
 
 External JavaScript files still do not load properly in older browsers. They
 actually display the code as text. This occurs even after the mime.types
 file is properly edited and the web server restarted.
 
 The server Env Variable reads Apache/1.2.4 FrontPage/3.0.3
 
 No further information has been discovered. My only hypothesis is that
 Apache w/Front Page Extensions might also have some config files that affect
 the .js suffix.
 
 Since I don't administer an Apache server myself on a Unix/Linux machine
 yet, I really have no clue what type of files are included with the Front
 Page Extensions. Apache for Windows doesn't have a set of Front Page
 Extensions yet, therefore no support from Microsoft.
 
 I realize this is not entirely within Apache's realm. I was hoping similar
 experiences/problems may have shed some light on possible explanations.

State-Changed-Why:

If newer browsers are treating the server-sent files
correctly and older ones aren't, it's clearly not an
Apache problem.  You might try asking on USENET, such as
in the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
