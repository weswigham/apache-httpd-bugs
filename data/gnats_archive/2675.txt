>Description:
The apachectl script provided with Apache 1.3.1 uses the 'kill -0' method to 
test if the httpd process is active.

This fact, at least on my HPUX 9.05 system, produces at least two problems:
1) 'apachectl start', run as root, produces a 
 'kill: xxxxx: no such process'
 because it always try to signal the process indicated by the PID file, even if
 the httpd daemon was stopped and the value of the PID file is invalid
2) if 'apachectl' is run by a normal user, a 
 'kill: xxxxx: permission denied'
 message is issued, because the httpd process is not owned by the user and 
 cannot be signaled to check for existence.

In any case, the message is actually just a warning, because the script 
work finely even if the process cannot be signaled.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Either the old method using 'ps' should be used, or the 
'kill -0 $PID' command should be wrapped in a variable to check for possible
error or messages during the command execution.

State-Changed-Why:

This has been addressed in 1.3.2 by having the server
unlink the PID file on a successful shutdown.  One of the
problems with ps is the wildly differing syntax from
platform to platform.

Please try upgrading to 1.3.2.
