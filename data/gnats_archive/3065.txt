>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0, SP3
Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 11.00.7022 for 80x86
>Description:
The following syntax makes problems:
Alias /fcgiUNC/   //AICHTAL-AICH/FCGISHARE/      
<Location /fcgi >
After the last / in the Alias statement must be a space or a blank line must follow this statement. There must not be only a LF/CR directly after the last slash. In this case the statement is "concatenated" with the following line ( in the example "Location ...") and this creates an invalid Alias statement. This is why the blank line as next line is a work around for this minor problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
white space after last "/"
