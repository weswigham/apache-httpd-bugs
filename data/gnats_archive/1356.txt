>Description:
I have an apache server running.  I have added some types via the
AddType directive in the config file.  I have a .htaccess file which
specifies that a script is to be run when a file of this type
is requested.  However, the script is not run.  If I create a link to
a file of a mime-types known type (and change the .htaccess accordningly),
the script runs.
>How-To-Repeat:
I could send some .conf files if that would be useful

State-Changed-Why:

Are you sure the .htaccess file is parsed (eg. 
AllowOverride All or FileInfo is given) and that
mod_action is compiled in and you are using the
correct Syntax on the Action directive?
This looks like a config problem to me...
