Solaris and Linux
>Description:
If there is a %2F (escaped '/') anwhere within a URL and it's redirected with
mod_rewrite, Apache will return an error instead of redirecting it.  This causes
problems when we try to redirect a GET form submission and one of the form
variables contains a pathname.

This is probably because mod_rewrite calls unescape_url(), which deliberately
croaks for %2F.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add this to a config file:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/foo http://www.apache.org/ [R]

Try this URL:
http://localhost/foo%2F
>Fix:
Provide an alternative to unescape_url() that doesn't do anything special for
%2F.
