RedHat 6.0 
>Description:
I am using RedHat 6.0 and Apache-1.3.6-7. I have added the following to
my srm.conf:
	AddHandler eperl-parsed .ehtml
	Action eperl-parsed /cgi-bin/eperl

When I access a .ehtml file from my browser eperl parses the page
partially, but not completely. If I run it from the command line I can
see that it creates an html page without errors, but my error_log
contains the message:
	handler "eperl-parsed" not found for [file-name]

It seems that a very simple .ehtml file will process correctly, but the
message still appears in the error_log. A complex .ehtml will not
display everything it is supposed to.

State-Changed-Why:

The spurious warning message will be fixed in the next release.
A patch can be found in PR 4807.

The other problem sounds like an error in eperl's buffering,
but you will have to ask the eperl author, or identify the
problem in such a way that we can reproduce it locally.
Ralf can probably find it given the script and enough info.
