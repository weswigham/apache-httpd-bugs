>Description:
Welp, here's what happens.  Apache seems to recursively parse SSI's.  I.E.
If I #include file B in file A, and file B #includes file C, Apache will parse
A,B and C.

Now, if I #include file A inside of file A, Apache gets stuck in a loop.
>How-To-Repeat:
make an html file, let's call it index.html, and include this line...
<!--#include file="index.html"> save it, turn on SSIs and set .html to be
server-parsed html, and try to request it.
>Fix:
Just a simple check of the list of filenames already included.  If the same name
occurs on the list, don't include it, or cause an error message.  It would make more sense
to generate a visible error, so that folks know there is a problem

State-Changed-Why:
I can not replicate this.  Please send a sample file
along with a copy of your config and where the file was
located on the server.  There is code to check for this, 
but there could be some path translations going on that
are confusing it.
