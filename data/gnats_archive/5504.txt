>Description:
Currently, the call to Cookie.setDomain() is commented out to address
bug #2593 -- when the browser requests a page by IP address.  (It probably
also fix the case where the hostname is not a FQDN, i.e. http://localhost/.)
However, this breaks when I want to have multiple Apache servers on
different hosts load balancing against the same Servlet Zone.  For
example, http://www.foo.com/ and https://secure.foo.com/ both hit the
same Servlet Zone and want to use the same sessions, but can't.
>How-To-Repeat:
Have to two Apache hosts, http://www.foo.com/ and https://secure.foo.com/
use the same Servlet Zone.  Or even have one host listening on two different
ports do the same.  Sessions are created for each host (or port).
>Fix:
I suggest putting an optional property in zone.properties.  Perhaps like this:
session.cookie.domain=.foo.com

 Why not just make it https://www.foo.com?

 For now, I'm just stuck with a certificate signed for secure.foo.com.
 
 But consider this...  If I have a pool of Apache servers load balancing,
 some of the servers may be special.  For example, some may be more
 powerful and run extra services, such as a chat server.  In which
 case, I'd like to point browsers to http://chat.foo.com/, but the main
 application logic and session management should still be shareable
 (and live in the same Servlet Zone).
 
 It would also be possible that secure.foo.com is a dedicated machine,
 and SSL wouldn't be available on www.foo.com (which could be a pool
 of servers).
