>Description:
the function find_path_info in util_script.c runs off the beginning of a string
if the two arguments are the same path. 

static int find_path_info (char *uri, char *path_info)
{
    int lu = strlen(uri);
    int lp = strlen(path_info);

    while (lu-- && lp-- && uri[lu] == path_info[lp]);

 --- NOTE ---
 if  the strings are the same, then lu goes to zero, and falls out but it still
  gets post decremented to -1. 

Therefore we can add a fix like this:
    if (lu==-1) lu=0;


--- otherwise we will try to access uri[-1] which is a really bad thing to do! --

    while (uri[lu] != '\0' && uri[lu] != '/')
    lu++;

    return lu;
}

If you have any questions, please drop me a note: alans@cs.stanford.edu

Thanks!
Alan

>Fix:
Fixed code:

static int find_path_info (char *uri, char *path_info)
{
    int lu = strlen(uri);
    int lp = strlen(path_info);

    while (lu-- && lp-- && uri[lu] == path_info[lp]);
    if (lu==-1) lu=0;
    while (uri[lu] != '\0' && uri[lu] != '/')
    lu++;

    return lu;

Fixed last week in revision 1.44 of util_script.c which
will be available with the next beta when released.  The
fix used was exactly the same as the one suggested here.
Thanks for the report.
