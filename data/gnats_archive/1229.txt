Doesn't matter
>Description:
In the Downloadfiles apache_1.2.4.tar.gz and apache_1.3a1.tar.gz there is no
file mod_setenvif.c as mentioned in the Description about Module mod_setenvif
(I found it as I looked for BrowserMatch).
Therefor the SetEnvIf-Directive doesn't work. (Perhaps it only misses or comes 
in the new release)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Insert mod_setenvif.c in the packages and makefiles

State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 15 07:38:29 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
As I already posted in response to your news query, it
is available starting in 1.3.  1.3 as in 1.3 no beta
no alpha.  Not 1.2, not 1.3a1, but 1.3.  Right now
that means it is not in any currently released version,
it comes in _AFTER_ 1.3a1.  It will be in 1.3 when it
is released, so it is said to be in 1.3.
