>Environment:
Windows XP
>Description:
On Windows XP Apache 1.3.22 displayed only partial content of images. I have the same problem with HTML pages in Apache 1.3.20 where PHP is build as module. When PHP is as CGI script HTML content is fine, but images displays partial. This problem is not for all images, only for biggest. May be this is problem with WINDOWS, I am not sure.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run Apache on Windows XP :-)
>Fix:
I can't suggest the way.
