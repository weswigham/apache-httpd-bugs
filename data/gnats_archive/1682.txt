How much would be _very_ much?

I checked a tape and it is in none of our 1.0 logs.

If this is not an error it should not log an error.  This shoud be a
configurable log message. Also the message probly could be changed to
better indicate the source of the problem/message.  Our customers didn't
appreciate it at first.

Is it possible to turn logging of this particular message OFF?  This is
akin to the logging of lame server delegation messages in named; at least
to me it is since i cant do anything about it.

>But how many of those messages do you see and how many hits
>get your server? 

Since you didn't specify an interval i hope this will do:
two one hour samples 

   113163  successfull hits 
   3096   total errs
   1288   Broken pipe errors 41.6% of all errs, 1.1% of all hits
 
   97773  successfull hits 
   2627   total errs
   1077   Broken pipe errors 41.0% of all errs, 1.1% of all hits

So i guest this "send body lost connection: site: broken pipe message is
not significant.  

On a similiar note some time ago i was taken aback by the large number of
collisions on our ethernet port some time ago but it turns out that it was
less than .01% of the total ethernet traffic.  Moral of the story is:
numbers dont always indicate the maginitude of the situation or problem.
