>Description:
i'm not sure i'd call this a bug, it's more a missing file.

i'm compiling php and mod_auth_mysql into apache 1.3.14. i've configured and made the
activate-module successfully, apache itself configures fine. but when i compile 
apache with modules the make files on alloc.h because it doesn't exist. compiling
apache without modules is successful.

The file has been renamed ap_alloc.h to
avoid conflicts with c++ headers.
