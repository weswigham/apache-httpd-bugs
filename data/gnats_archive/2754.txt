Linux 2.0.35
>Description:
I have mod_speling compiled into httpd.

I have a directory /stats

I (had) a <Location /status>   that had a SetHandler server-status

Prior to turning on CheckSpelling, I could use the URL:

www.server.com/status   to get the Apache server status.

After turning on CheckSpelling...this URL would be "fixed"

to /stats

Just a naive question....shouldn't mod_speling check locations as
well as directories before making its spelling correction?

(I tried to turn off spelling in the Location, but that gives an error).
>How-To-Repeat:
See above
>Fix:
Maybe it doesn't need fixing (i.e., I expect this is all consistent with
the Apache semantics), but perhaps it is worth a mention in the 
mod_speling documentation that Locations are NOT handled, or at least
some clarification of that point.
