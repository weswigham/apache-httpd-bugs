 PO2 Visage and Contour Oxygen Rejuvenating creams
 
 
 
 pO2 VISAGE - for the face
 pO2 CONTOUR -for the body and areas of cellulite
 
 What it does
 Puts oxygen back into the skin (together with vitamins A and E) 
 
 How it works
 Patented stabilisation of oxygen within a cream - absorbed into the skin,
 releasing oxygen. Oxygen is the life force of every cell. Skin after the
 age of 25 becomes progressively starved of oxygen. 
 
 How to use it
 Apply sparingly to clean dry skin with a smoothing action, avoiding any
 rubbing (nb this rubs the oxygen out into the air!). Leave on skin to
 absorb for 5-10 mins. After this time, dab off any excess and apply usual
 moisturisers and cosmetics - Nourella 24 hour cream and body lotion are
 especially recommended. 
 
 The results
 Reoxygenates skin cells, encourages natural rejuvenation. Look for:
 smoother, clearer, firmer, more elastic skin within a week or two.
 pO2 CONTOUR - also specially good for areas of cellulite. 
 
 Suitable for
 For all skin types and age groups. For use with all good quality cosmetics
 and toiletries. 
 
 Developed by
 Prof Paul Herzog and manufactured by Laboratoires Paul et Karin Herzog,
 Switzerland.
