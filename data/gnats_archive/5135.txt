>Description:
The file descriptors in the BUFF API are dead and do not work when opened into a FILE * variable using fdopen().
Example, I tried that in mod_cgi:
starting of the func ... FILE *myfile;

if ( ( myfile = fdopen ( script_in -> fd , "r" ) ) == NULL )
{
  puts ( "error opening handle" );
  return OK;
}

I also tried script_in -> fd_in ... as I was on Windows, it prited the error back on the console screen. I also tried script_out -> fd and fd_in, and resulted in assuming that you have problem with your BUFF api...

All I am trying to do is convert a BUFF into FILE *
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Don't destroy the fd and fd_in handles if you destroy them....

State-Changed-Why:
You can't just muck with internal fields of a structure
and expect them to magically do what you want.  There is
no API for getting a file descriptor out of a BUFF.

If you want to know exactly why fdopen is failing, you
should print the value of the descriptor you are trying
to fdopen and the errno when it fails.  But regardless
of why it fails, BUFFs are _not_ just some way of hiding
a file descriptor.  You can't just think "hey, they use a
file descriptor so I can just yank it out.".
