>Description:
Small problem in Makefile.nt
Text: "installr: release" should be "installr: apacher" and
Text: "installd: debug" should be "installr: apached". that's all. It's
simple, but I would like to let you know
>How-To-Repeat:
nmake /f Makefile.nt installr
>Fix:
Replace following two lines like this:

"installr: release" -> "installr: apacher" 
"installd: debug"   -> "installr: apached%2

State-Changed-Why:
This was fixed slightly before the 1.3a1 release. However,
the fix only made it into apache_1.3a1.zip; the .tar.gz
and .tar.Z files do not have it. Windows users should 
download the zipfile anyway, since it has Windows line
breaks, wheras the others have Unix line breaks.
