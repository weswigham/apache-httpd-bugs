>Environment:
Ultrix V4.3 w/gcc v2.7.2.1
>Description:
buff.c does not compile, on the above platform.  Here is the error:
gcc -c -Iregex  -O2 -DULTRIX -DSTATUS   buff.c
In file included from buff.c:61:
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mips-dec-ultrix4.3/2.7.2.1/include/sys/uio.h:43: parse error before `caddr_t'
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mips-dec-ultrix4.3/2.7.2.1/include/sys/uio.h:43: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mips-dec-ultrix4.3/2.7.2.1/include/sys/uio.h:45: parse error before `}'
buff.c: In function `bcwrite':
buff.c:645: storage size of `vec' isn't known
gmake: *** [buff.o] Error 1

This is because uio.h uses the type caddr_t, which is defined
in sys/types.h on Ultrix, but sys/types.h is not included
in buff.c.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I worked around it by adding #include <sys/types.h> to buff.c.
You may have another solution.
