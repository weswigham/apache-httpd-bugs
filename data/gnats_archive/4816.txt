Hi,

Before I dive into Apache source for some re-wiring, I thought it would be nice to ask you if you guyz have any reports on this (search didn't get me any results).

Is there an easy way to parse a CGI output for SSI directives?

If no - then is there an easy way to for mod_cgi to communicate with mod_include?

Thanx guyz.

Will Apache 2.0 allow stuff like this?

State-Changed-Why:
There is currently no way to parse cgi output for SSI tags.
This feature has been requested many times in the past, and
it is in plan for some time during the 2.X release.  I would
expect to see this in 2.0, but hopefully 2.1 or 2.2.  I am
putting this in suspended state until it is implemented.

State-Changed-Why:
This feature has been added to Apache 2.0, and will be
available in the next alpha release.  Mod_include was
broken in the last alpha, or it would have been available
in a7.

Thank you for using Apache
