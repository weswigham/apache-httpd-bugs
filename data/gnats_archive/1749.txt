>Description:
Ok I reboot the server works fine all three VIRTUAL IP based hosts work FINE. 
20 minutes later the apache forgets the other virtualip servers and only 
answers to the last one in the httpd.conf. Why? I have read the virtual ip 
information on the site and applied several different variations all to no 
avail 20 minutes later.
Here is my httpd.conf

>How-To-Repeat:
Well I don't know how to reproduce it other than to reboot and wait 20 minutes
? you can go to any of those url's in the conf and probably see the error I get
after 20 minutes No file or service exists matching "/". 
BTW this problem also exists with 1.2.5 please help

State-Changed-Why:
The two servers you complain about not working are currently
not being served by a box running Apache.  The box claims it is running:
  Worldgroup/2.00 MajorTCP/IP [2.21-1] nbTCP: 255/32 86760321

It seems like you have some other box on your network
configured to use the same IPs.  Probably works at boot
because of how the ARP interactions happen.

 Yes your correct that bbs.gaianet.net is a worldgroup bbs system that runs
 httpd as www.gaianet.net.  Why would it be interfereing with
 earth.gaianet.net and the other 2?

 I have no idea.  You need to look at how it is configured because it _IS_
 stealing the IP address.  Try telnetting to the IP addresses that you
 think should go to vhosts on the box running Apache and you will see this. 
 
 There is nothing Apache can do about that.
