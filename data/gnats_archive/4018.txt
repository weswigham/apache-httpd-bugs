>Description:
I'm trying to run the example/test program provided with Apache-JServ-1.0b3.

Everything compiled just fine, a few errors, but I was able to fix them easily
with some CLASSPATH modifications.

I've installed the mod_jserv package and Apache starts fine (if I do httpd -l I see it in the list, too).

But the problem is that each time I attempt to invoke the example servlet (localhost:80/example/Hello), I see these errors:

[08/03/1999 00:55:45:606] (EMERGENCY) ajp11: cannot scan servlet headers
[08/03/1999 00:55:45:606] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "ajpv11"

In the meantime, the browser just waits and waits, but the servlet doesn't respond.
