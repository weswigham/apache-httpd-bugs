Expiration format

In 
   "EEEE, dd-MMM-yy kk:mm:ss zz" 

hours could range up to 24, years only to 99.  (Won't support Y2K.)

   So from the Netscape cookie spec, I changed it in my copy to:

   "EEE, dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss 'GMT'"

This should improve reliability a bit.

The new format is working fine so far on our development site.
>How-To-Repeat:
Telnet to the HTTP port and request any page that sets a cookie
with an expiration date.
>Fix:
See description.

 cris, please check out the latest cvs source of the 0.9.x tree...i believe
 this issue was already fixed. could you confirm it?
 
 instructions are at:
 
 <http://java.apache.org/main/cvs.html>
 
 module name is:
 
 jserv_0_9
 
 thanks,

 Hi Jon,
 
 It's very nice to hear back so quickly!
 
 About the expiration dates.  The code now casts to long at the needed
 spot, so dates should no longer wrap around, but the date formatting is
 the same as before.
 
 The "kk" format for hours goes from 1 to 24 instead of 0-23, and the
 "yy" year format only prints a 2-digit year, which is not so cool.  My
 proposed "EEE" rather than "EEEE" will print a 3-letter day of week,
 which is probably not necessary but appears to conform to RFC822.
 
 So you still may want to change the date format to use some of the
 elements suggested in my bug report.

 Note that there is no y2k problem with only using a 2 digit year, since
 there are well defined semantics for it.  People have been using cookies
 with two-digit expiriation dates after y2k for quite a while now.
 
 You also have to be careful generating cookies to be sure that you don't
 generate ones that conform to specs but aren't accepted by
 implementations.

 Hi Marc,
 
 Point taken on the importance of real compatibility compared with
 specs.  Top priority is that the code should work properly with other
 software, in other words with browsers.
 
 I did get motivated to look at what Perl does, since Perl is heavily
 used for CGI scripting and its source code is available.  Here is the
 subroutine from the current CGI.pm (2.46) for Perl 5.
 
 # This internal routine creates date strings suitable for use in
 # cookies and HTTP headers.  (They differ, unfortunately.)
 # Thanks to Fisher Mark for this.
 'expires' => <<'END_OF_FUNC',
 sub expires {
     my($time,$format) = @_;
     $format ||= 'http';
 
     my(@MON)=qw/Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec/;
     my(@WDAY) = qw/Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat/;
 
     # pass through preformatted dates for the sake of expire_calc()
     $time = expire_calc($time);
     return $time unless $time =~ /^\d+$/;
 
     # make HTTP/cookie date string from GMT'ed time
     # (cookies use '-' as date separator, HTTP uses ' ')
     my($sc) = ' ';
     $sc = '-' if $format eq "cookie";
     my($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday) = gmtime($time);
     $year += 1900;
     return sprintf("%s, %02d$sc%s$sc%04d %02d:%02d:%02d GMT",
                    $WDAY[$wday],$mday,$MON[$mon],$year,$hour,$min,$sec);
 
 }
 
 Looks like the 4-digit year is OK.
 
 Regards,
