>Description:
Proxy conf on machine 'ise.ise.fhg.de' (gateway):
	ProxyRequests On
	ProxyRemote * http://fhg-freiburg-cache.ise.fhg.de:8080
	NoProxy .ise.fhg.de

rewriting defined in .htaccess for virtual host pab-opto.de on above machine:
	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteRule ^q$ http://tos76.ise.fhg.de:6544 [P]

(tos76 in on the intranet)

access to 'http://www.pab-opto.de/rw/q' triggers proxy request to 
'http://fhg-freiburg-cache.ise.fhg.de' , but should be served directly
from gateway to intranet. The cache machine is 'outside'. Same holds true
for remotes proxies outside the ise.fhg.de domain. 
Otherwise (non rewrite context) the NoProxy line seems to work ok.

 What are you expecting the above config to do?  
 
 Why do you think that http://www.pab-opto.de/rw/q should be excluded from
 using the ProxyRemote setting?  It doesn't match the NoProxy and it
 doesn't match the RewriteRule.

 The .htaccess is the 'rw' subdirectory, and thereby does match the
 rewrite rule. That part works fine.
 The 'http://tos76.ise.fhg.de:6544' address matches the NoProxy
 directive (IMHO), but triggers the ProxyRemote command.
