>Environment:
OpenBSD marvin 2.0 MARVIN#2 i386
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
in error_logs : "httpd: caught SIGTERM, shutting down"
At most busy times, the server stops, we have to restart it
>How-To-Repeat:
Now we starded an older version, patched by an other person who is not here now, 
that seems to work better.
So it is impossible to try our server from outside.
>Fix:
no, sorry

State-Changed-Why:
Are you absolutely sure that there is nothing sending
a signal to the httpd process?  Something running from a 
cron job or log rotation script?  I have not heard of
this problem before, and that section should only be
reached if the parent gets a SIGTERM.

Does the older version work fine?  What version is it? 
What patches were applied to it?

State-Changed-Why:
Apache doesn't send sigterm to itself so this must be a local
problem.
