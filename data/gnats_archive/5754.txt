>Release:        1.3.11
>Organization:
>Environment:
Downloaded binary version. Windows 98. ActivePerl build 516, with CGI.pm version 2.46
>Description:
When executing Perl CGI scripts (I tested this on a number of different CGI scripts with similar results), the DOS box that runs the Apache daemon renames itself to 'perl' instead of "APACHE". No interpreter trace remains in memory though.
>How-To-Repeat:
Matts script archive sample scripts give this problem when run on the server. This problem is unique to 1.3.11, previous versions (ie:1.3.9) work ok.
>Fix:
restarting the server daemon (not just apache -k restart, but a straight apache -k shutdown, and then apache -k start) fixes the problem. Sorry, I don't have any expertise in assessing the severity of this problem. To me, its just an inconvenience....

 > State-Changed-Why:
 
 Problem is reproduced with Apache 1.3.12 on Win32
 All external scripting tools (tested with Python, Perl
 and PHP scripts as well as compiled executable CGI)
 cause the Apache DOS-box to rename itself to the name
 of the scripting tool.
 
 ie: running a Perl script on the server causes the DOS
 box to rename itself to perl.exe
 running a Python script causes a rename to python.exe
 running a PHP script causes a rename to php.exe
 running an external EXE (test.exe) caused a rename to
 test.exe
 
 shutting down or restarting the httpd makes the
 problem correct itself.
