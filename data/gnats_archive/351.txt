>Description:
access.conf contains :

<Location /info>
SetHandler server-info
</Location>

Any time I access to any URLs begin from /info (for example '/informix') I see Apache's server info.
Doesn't matter exists or not the directory for /informix.  

If it exits then the permitions of directory plays a role for server access 
and access.log contains (Indexes is disabled and /informix/index.html exists):


wildcat.tomcat.ru - - [10/Apr/1997:15:16:36 +0300] "GET /informix HTTP/1.0" 302-
wildcat.tomcat.ru - - [10/Apr/1997:15:16:37 +0300] "GET /informix/ HTTP/1.0" 200 22387


If it doesn't exit then access.log contains :

wildcat.tomcat.ru - - [10/Apr/1997:15:15:56 +0300] "GET /informix HTTP/1.0" 200 22387


I didn't found this problem in 1.2b8

As you stated, this problem is fixed in current betas.
We don`t have the resources to even think about trying
to release versions of 1.1.x with all bugfixes in.
