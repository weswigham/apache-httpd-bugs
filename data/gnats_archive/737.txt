>Description:
 I believe I have found a bug in the Apache server.  The server is not prompting for user authentication for my Perl CGI programs that are under a protected directory.  I am using a .htaccess file as shown below:

      AuthUserFile /local/www/conf/.htpasswd
      AuthGroupFile /dev/null
      AuthName Security Protected Pages
      AuthType Basic

      <Limit GET POST PUT>
       require user pottersc
      require user smithja
       </Limit>

The .htaccess file correctly protects static HTML documents which are in the same directory as my CGI programs, however the CGI programs can be called without involking user authentication.  I am also interested in getting access to the REMOTE_USER environment variable from within my CGI program, but this is not set since the server does not recognize the CGI programs as being protected documents.  I have tried this using both GET and POST Action Methods, and the result is the same in both cases.  I have submitted a request for help to the users group but have not gotten a response in 3 days.  I have tried everything I know and have come up with nothing.  Is this an Apache bug or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

It is inside the corporate firewall, so outside access is not easily possible.

State-Changed-Why:
Are your CGIs in the same directory or are they in /cgi-bin ?
Also please try upgrading to 1.2.1 and see if the problem persists.
