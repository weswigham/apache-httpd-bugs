>Environment:
Windows 95 (400.950 B)
>Description:
According to the instructions in http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html (under
Signalling Apache When Running) one should stop Apache by signalling

apache -k shutdown

When I do this, I'm told that the -k isn't a valid option, i.e:

Error in argument 1, char 2: option not found k
Usage: C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE\APACHE.EXE [-d directory] [-f file]
                                              [-C "directive"] [-c "directive"]
                                              [-v] [-V] [-h] [-l] [-S] [-t]
Options:
  -D name          : define a name for use in <IfDefine name> directives
  -d directory     : specify an alternate initial ServerRoot
  -f file          : specify an alternate ServerConfigFile
  -C "directive"   : process directive before reading config files
  -c "directive"   : process directive after  reading config files
  -v               : show version number
  -V               : show compile settings
  -h               : list available configuration directives
  -l               : list compiled-in modules
  -S               : show parsed settings (currently only vhost settings)
  -t               : run syntax test for configuration files only
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, don't know...
>Fix:
Upgrade to 1.3.3? (only that 1.3.3 caused an error and refused to start at all,
stating that my system didn't allow it)
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 20 08:18:48 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

The "-k" options are only available as of Apache 1.3.3.
Sorry, the documentation doesn't make this clear; I'm
fixing that.
