Running apache 1.3.12 on an Apple PowerMac running OS X Server 1.1
>Description:
Have built apache 1.3.12 with mod_put linked in. Have configured Apache to allow PUT requests for / and for /cgi-bin/. PUT requests within / but not within /cgi-bin/ function properly.

PUT requests to URIs within /cgi-bin/ result in apache issuing a response as tho an HTTP GET request had been sent. I have verified that indeep a PUT request IS being sent. If the cgi is present the cgi is executed and apache returns the result of the cgi. If the file does not exist apahie returns an error 404.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache leaves a lot of the correct handling of different
HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT) to CGIs. I.e. your CGI is
not handling the PUT correctly. If you are trying to use
PUTs to publish CGI scripts then it sounds like mod_put
isn't going to solve your problem.

 I'm not convinced that this is the case. It looks to me like the PUT request
 is not being passed to mod_put at all and that Apache is handling the PUT
 request as a GET. 
 
 In fact, consider a web server which does not have mod_put installed at all. Tests performed with server at <http://www.barebones.com>
 
 A PUT to /test.html (which does not exist) returns
 
 HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
 
 A PUT to /index.html (which does exist) returns
 
 HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
 
 
 However:
 
 A PUT to /cgi-bin/test.html (which does not exist) returns
 
 HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
 
 A PUT to /cgi-bin/faq/faq.pl (which does exist) returns
 
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 
 followed by the output of executing the cgi at this URL.
 
 
 Now, the server at this address is running Tenon's iTools but you'll get the
 same behaviour with the server at <http://www.apache.org>.
 
 This is an Apache bug, not a mod_put bug. I don't know if mod_put can handle
 a PUT to a file in the /cgi-bin/ tree (I suspect it can) but it is never
 getting the chance to try because Apache has a bug.

 That doesn't compute. What about the case where one tries tp PUT to a URI
 which doesn't point to an exiting file. The server returns an error 404. You
 can not possible tell me that the CGI is handling the PUT as a GET because
 the CGI does not exist.

 Perhaps "deliberate mis-feature". Seems to me the RFC is pretty clear on
 what is supposed to happen when a PUT command is received and it is pretty
 clear that Apache is NOT doing the right thing and is therefor NOT compliant
 with RFC 2068.
 
 Further more, RFC 2068 says
 
 > The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
 > supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing

 Under this definition the current behaviour for an existing file and a file
 which does not exist are both broken. You simply can not justify the current
 behaviour as a feature as it violates RFC 2068.
 
 Please fix.

 Of course. Putting un-audited code on your web server is dangerous,
 especially server code (CGIs) that doesn't uderstand HTTP to the
 extent that is required.

 Write a CGI to handle 404 errors which knows what to do with a PUT.

 Probably :-)
