Yeah, I know, it's nice to know how many Apache servers are out there in the world, and what their revisions are.

However, as a corporate security directive for my last contract, I had to hack out the C code that generated the Server: header entirely.  The ServerTokens option has no way to actually turn the Server: header OFF, and the mod_header Header directive can't "unset" it.

There are legitimate security reasons for disabling this response header, and Apache already offers differing degrees of the response, so why not "no response"?
>How-To-Repeat:
See documentation for ServerTokens and try "unset"ting the Server header using mod_headers.
>Fix:
Offer a "NONE" option which will suppress the Server: header entirely.

(Note that this could also be combined with BrowserMatch and metadata to produce flexible Server: header responses for working around broken browsers.)
