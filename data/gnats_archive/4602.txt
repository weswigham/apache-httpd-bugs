Subject:
             Deny Directive Not Working!

Hi,

I'm implementing the Deny directive like so:

    Order deny,allow
    Deny from .whatever.com 207.171.231.230
    Allow from all

in my httpd.conf, yet access is NOT denied to the specified domain or ip. I
tested this by putting in my own ip and testing from my box via Netscape and
telnet.

I put the Deny in a Directory container and in a Directory container inside a
VirtualHost - still neither  works. This seems like it should be REALLY
SIMPLE... what am I missing here?!

Deny is an Access Handler, I don't reference any other Access Handlers so
nothing should be short-circuiting the call to mod_access.

Any insight GREATLY appreciated (it's always the 'simple' things that kill me).

thanks,
    -tm

>How-To-Repeat:
Create Deny directives in httpd.conf and restart the server.
Request the denied content from the denied host/ip.
I have repeated on this Linux 5.2 using apache 1.3.4 and 1.3.6.

State-Changed-Why:
I have worked to verify this PR. The first quoted part (from
Brian) should work as specified (and in fact does work correctly
for me on version 1.3.7-dev). The second part (from Tammy, the
PR's submitter) should behave excactly as it does. 

Beacuse the Order is specified as "deny,allow" the allow clause
is processed last. The text in the Deny clause will do nothing
since the last thing evaluated is "Allow from All". To fix this
you should change the Order to "allow,deny".

So, in summary, Tammy should change the Order to "allow,deny"
and Brian should try again with a more recent version.

Please reply if these are fixed.
