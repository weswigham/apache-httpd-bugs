>Environment:
RedHat Linux 5.1, jdk 1.1.6v4 from www.blackdown.org
>Description:
in conf/Apache-1.3.1 directory in the jserv.properties file the example for
  security.MaxConnections = 50;
                            ^^^^^
the semicolon at the end will raise a java exception and prevent jserv from 
running properly - logs will give you: Virtual Machine died....
I know it's a simple thing, but it took me a while to track down :-)
This error is NOT in the conf/jserv.properties file though.

One other thing you may want to put in your documentation is that the
trace log file must be world readable (or set to the group or owner of whatever
your Apache server runs as) or you will get errors when Apache tries
to run JServ with trace=yes.  
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
the JServ initialization reads the jserv.properties and zone.properties files
(I'm guessing), you could catch the Conversion Exception and use the default
for that property so that if the value side of the name = value pair raises
and exception it will use the default for that name.  It will make the
initialization more robust.

You guys are doing a great job!
I've just got JServ up and running it looks great!
