when consulting the iana registered mime types list
(ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types)
i found a bunch of vendor tree (vnd) subtypes that are pretty common
but that aren't in the standard mime.types file that ships with
apache 1.3.0.  

for example, there's no listing at all for m$ excel (which should be
application/vnd.ms-excel) and the listing for m$ powerpoint is listed as
application/powerpoint instead of the iana standard
application/vnd.ms-powerpoint type.

unless i'm totally misunderstanding something here, it seems the
mime.types file is a little out of date.

thanks for your time.  say hi to brian and cliff for me.

 That is a listing of MIME types.  What the mime.types file is is a mapping
 between filename extensions and MIME types.  It really does little good to
 add zillions of types to it without having any extensions to use for them.
 
 We are perfectly willing to add more types (as long as the extension is
 clearly for that type, but the IANA list isn't of much help.
 
 It is worth considering changing ms-powerpoint to vnd.ms-powerpoint I
 guess, even if no one uses that.

 yes, i totally realize that.  what i was suggesting was that someone
 periodically check the IANA list to make sure the mime.types file uses
 the latest strings.
 
 btw, the mime.types file *does* contain a handful of entries that don't
 have any extensions listed.  does apache do anything with them or are
 they just placeholders?

 actually, it's a good start.  i've noticed that netscape communicator
 has a very through list of mime type to extension mappings and have been
 referencing that too.  perhaps you could use that as a source?

 on extranet sites, very few do, but on intranet sites, a lot do.  same
 with excel.  it'd be great to see those supported out of the box.
 
 thanks for your quick response,
