>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP 3
>Description:
This problem was reported against JServ 0.9.11/Apache 1.3.0 but is still a
problem in Apache 1.3.6, JServ 1.0b5, JServ 1.0, see PR #2591 for details.

Briefly the problem is that since headers are sent as soon as the first
byte is written to the output stream, it's impossible to set any headers
from a servlet invoked through a SERVLET tag (since JServSSI has already
sent some bytes).
>How-To-Repeat:
See PR #2591
>Fix:
The problem can either be corrected in JServOutputStream as described in
PR #2591, or by buffering the output in JServSSI.
