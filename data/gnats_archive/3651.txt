>Environment:
Win 98, JDK1.2, JSDK2.0
>Description:
C:\usr\local\Apache>apache
Syntax error on line 793 of C:\USR\LOCAL\APACHE/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load c:/usr/local/apache/modules/ApacheModuleJServ.dll into server:
>How-To-Repeat:
Chances are if you install The same win32 Apache and then try to add the same
win32 JServ, you will see the problem even on Win95
>Fix:
Find out what options 1.3.4 win32 was compiled with and compare this to
the options for JServ. Chances are there is an incompatibility introduced
by 1.3.4

P.S. Please fix the bug submission page at
http://java.apache.org/jserv/sendbug.html
so that it no longer complains about a blank category

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 15 08:29:35 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This problem is due to the fact that
jserv is complied for 1.3.3, not 1.3.4.  It has to be recompiled
for 1.3.4 due to shortcomings in the way DLLs work.
