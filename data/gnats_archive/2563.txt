>Description:
I am attempting to monitor the activity of the parent httpd process in Apache so that if it dies it can be restarted on another machine.  However, I am having a wierd problem, when I start the httpd daemon like this:

./httpd &
[1234]
It prints a process number in brackets, but when I do a "ps -ef" that process ID no longer exists.  Since my monitoring software has to launch the httpd daemon and keep track of the first one it keeps trying to restart it because it thinks it has died...  I have used that switch (forget which one it is from the command line, I think -D, where it only runs one daemon for debugging) and then everything works fine, however obviously I don't want to do that in a production environment... Any suggestions or ideas regarding this?...

State-Changed-Why:
That is expected and normal, and is the way that nearly
all daemons behave on Unix and is, in fact, part of
the meaning of daemon.

There is no way to prevent that in Apache, however you could
just read the pid of the parent from the pid file
(ie. httpd.pid) and us ethat.

 Marc,
 
 I apprecaite your quick reply...   I guess this just won't work then, 
 because my monitoring software can't just monitor a pid, it's a wrapper 
 that sits around whatever daemon it is suppose to be monitoring......  If 
 you've got any suggestions in this regard I'd love to hear them, 
 essentially our HA software needs to be able to start/stop and control 
 the service that is running because when it goes down it attempts to 
 restart it X number of times and if it is unsueccessful it physically 
 reconfigures the interface on another machine and decommissions it from 
 the failed server and attempts to restart it there...
