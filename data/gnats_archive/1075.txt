Apache 2.0 running on AIX
>Description:
We have Unix version of Apache 2 installed on AIX. After the release of MSIE 4.0 Preview 2, we have received user reports that they cannot get into our web server. We've also do the test on our site and find that this is the case. MSIE 4.0 Preview 2 can get into our other web servers based on NT-IIS, but cannot get thru to Apache. There is no error message on both MSIE 4.0 Preview 2 or on Apache's error_log. It just keep waiting till time out. Is there any problem on the Apache area? We are in need of the solution as a number of our users have been switched to MSIE 4.0.

Thank you for your attention.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.ipoline.com from MSIE 4.0 Preview 2

Other web servers based on NT that works, http://admin.ipoline.com and http://home.ipoline.com

State-Changed-Why:
MSIE is broken.  Broken.  I have no idea what version
of Apache you are running (it claims to be 1.2.1), but
it isn't 2.0 since 2.0 doesn't exist.

This is a bug in MSIE.  It should be corrected in the
next release.  See the patch at http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/apply_to_1.2.1/
for a fix or upgrade to 1.2.4 and use the same directives
listed in the patch.

 FYI (now that I have it handy), to be exact, the line you need to add to
 your config file in 1.2.4 is: 
 
         BrowserMatch "MSIE 4\.0b2;" nokeepalive force-response-1.0 downgrade-1.0
