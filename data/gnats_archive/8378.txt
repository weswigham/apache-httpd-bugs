>Description:
when trying to start Apache twice using the same configuration i get the
following error message in error_log:

[crit] (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to port 5555

however, apache terminates with exit status 0. shouldn't the error condition
be reported by using an error exit status?

the same applies to trying to start Apache on a port with insufficient
privileges:

(13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to port 55
