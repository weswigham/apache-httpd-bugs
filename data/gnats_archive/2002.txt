To restart our httpd, we use

kill -HUP `cat /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/httpd.pid`

Most of the time, this successfully restarts the web server, allowing us
to rotate our logs.  But sometimes the server shuts down leaving a few
httpd processes that are unkillable.  (they refuse to respond to "kill -9").
The only recourse at that point is a reboot.

We have also seen similar behavior when stopping the web server, using:

kill `cat /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/httpd.pid`

Some of the processes hang inexplicably.  The server root is on an
NFS-mounted volume, if that is of any help.

 Did you try adding a "LockFile /tmp/accept.lock" or something along those
 lines to your Configuration file?  You must not have it on a NFS mounted
 disk.

   I didn't realize I was supposed to respond to anything.  The issue
   has not been resolved.  We've had to hack together a solution where
   we try to start the server every minute for 15 minutes after we
   restart the server just in case it doesn't restart properly.

 There was no response recorded in the bug database, and since you said
 your serverroot was on an NFS volume this was almost certainly the
 problem.  Did you get his message?  Was that the problem?

   Our documents are on an NFS volume, but the ServerRoot is on a local
   disk.

 Hmm, okay, that's usually been the cause of unkillable processes that we've
 seen.  To be fair, there /should/ be nothing that Apache can do to cause
 unkillable processes; that's clearly an operating system bug.  The best we
 can hope to do is avoid some legitimate sequence of events which leads to
 that situation; so to help you any further we'd need some better
 information as to what conditions cause these sporadic unkillable processes
 occur.
 
 Not to sound like I'm avoiding the issue, but isn't Irix up to 6.4 now, or
 at least 6.3?
 
 If you can't kill a process you probably can't ktrace it.  Can you see what
 state it was last in?  I'm not familiar with Irix's process debugging and
 management tools.
 
 	Brian

 I am really tempted to say that this is an IRIX problem related to NFS.
 
 I regularily see unkillable processes (blocked in uninterruptable NFS
 things) on several versions of IRIX when NFS is involved; not just Apache,
 but tons of things.  I really doubt this is Apache's fault; the only thing
 I can suggest is that you try upgrading and downgrading IRIX and adding
 and removing patches.

   It could be -- since we run little else on the machine other than
   our httpd, we haven't seen such behavior manifested elsewhere.

   Thanks for the advice.  I inherited these SGI boxes from my predecessor.
   If I had my druthers, we'd be running all Linux (even if it would take
   two or three times the number of machines to match the horsepower of
   the Challenges).

 An easy way to test it, depending on your available resources, would be to
 have a local non-NFS'd copy of your document tree.  If you do that and
 don't have errors, well 
 there's your answer.
