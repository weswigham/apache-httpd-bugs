>Description:
It appears that a DoS -- or at least a log flooding -- is possible if apache is
configured to display an local, custom error document in response to say, error
404.  The custom error document must contain a <link> tag that in turn contains
a relative href attribute, ie, <link rel=stylesheet href=foo/bar.css>.  If a
request is made for a *directory* that does not exist, an an attempt to access
non-existant-dir/foo/bar.css, which in turn does not exist.  We then wind up with
a request for non-existant-dir/foo/foo/bar.css, which doesn't exist, then
non-existant-dir/foo/foo/foo/bar.css, etc etc until something blows up.

From my access log:

192.168.1.212 - - [27/Nov/2000:15:12:40 -0500] "GET /foo/images/styles.css HTTP/1.0" 404 859

(sorry for any wrapping)

I was using Netscape 4.76 under Linux when I found this problem.  This appears
to in fact be a Netscape flaw (or a combination of Netscape+apache) because
this does not happen with IE 5.0+ wunder windows 2000 (but it does happen with
Netscape under windows 2000).
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Configure apache to display a custom error 404 message:
ErrorDocument 404 /error404.html
2) Construct /error404.html such that it contains a <link> tag with a href
attribute that is relative.  To see the staircase effect described above, be
sure the href contains at least one directory component.
3) From netscape, request a directory that does not exist on the web
server.
>Fix:
The simplest way is not to use <link> in a custom error document.  Otherwise,
the admin should ensure that all hrefs in a custom error document are absolute.
The apache manual should mention somthing to this effect; it should explain to
the user that a faulty custom error document could get apache caught in a loop.

You can probably also work around this problem by turning off
MultiViews.

State-Changed-Why:

This is not an Apache flaw.  It is a combination of two
problems:

1. You should never use relative references in 
ErrorDocument's.  There is no way to know what
base directory the client thinks it is originating from,
so relative references will always be dangerous.

2. Netscape has a bad habit of serving the 
ErrorDocument when it can't locate a CSS page.
It should be just ignoring the CSS page in
this case and serving the original document.
This is a client bug.

In any case, this is not a real denial-of-service
attack.  It is just a client going nuts.  You
can avoid it, as you mentioned, by not
using relative references in ErrorDocuments.

Thanks for using Apache.
