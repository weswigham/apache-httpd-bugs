I do not like to copy-paste as a general programming principle.

When configuring apache, I often have to copy-paste some parts.
In order to avoid this I needed the ability to define and use macros
in runtime configuration files. 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Sure. I wrote a module which handles this and which could be integrated in
core apache, if approved. Benefit: everybody would have the feature. Moreover
the whole world could maintain it instead of me alone. That would be cool;-)
The module is available at:

   http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~coelho/mod_macro/

I can make changes if required and then give the code away to the apache group.
