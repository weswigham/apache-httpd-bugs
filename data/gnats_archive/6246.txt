>Environment:
Redhat Linux 6.2 2.2.14-5.0 #1 
standard gcc from Redhat 6.2
>Description:
Starting the server fails on the following lines from httpd.conf, with this
sort of message:

Syntax error on line 131 in file httpd.conf: API module structure 'perl_module'
in file ...modules/libperl.so is garbled - perhaps this is not an Apache 
module DSO?

The lines that cause this (and a similar error for php) are:
LoadModule php_module modules/mod_php.so
LoadModule php3_module modules/libphp3.so
LoadModule perl_module modules/libperl.so
AddModule mod_php.c
AddModule mod_php3.c
AddModule mod_perl.c

These lines have not been changed (well,except commented out for now) from the
orignal config.   Further, I just did a clean reinstall just for kicks and it 
responds the same way.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install apache3.12 with --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=most
--enable-shared=max
