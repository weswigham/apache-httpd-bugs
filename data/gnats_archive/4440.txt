Apache does not follow symbolic links (although asked to) across file systems.

When you have for instance 3 file systems linked as show by the following df output :
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda1             297792   69929   227863     23%   /
/dev/hda3              49863   11921    37942     24%   /var
/dev/hda4            6777378  683893  6093485     10%   /home             

and in / is a symbolic link called usr wich points to the directory /home/usr

and you put an alias direct in the configuration files of apache like the following :
Alias /error/ /usr/error/          (wich is actually /home/usr/error)

then when trying to access http://servername.foo.com/error/document.html
you get a Forbidden (403 ?) answer from the server ...
