State-Changed-Why:
I'm sorry, I don't see where the problem is.  Are you
saying that nlr.html is longer than what is showing up?
The end of nlr.html as it shows up when looking at that
file is the same as the end when it is included in
rondzend.html.

What is getting truncated?

 I took a look at the document with Netscape 4.04 and the 
 problem occurs, but when I use lynx, the problem doesn't occur. I'm 
 sorry to have bothered you, but this seems to be a client problem.
