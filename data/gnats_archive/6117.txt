Hi

I've setup a restricted zone on my server using 

<Directory /path/directory >
 order deny, allow
 deny from all
 allow from domain.com
</directory>

and a .htaccess file (absed on your documentation)

All works fine except that I must enter my login name and my passwd 2 times.

Is this a problem from my part or from yours ?
How can I fix this ?

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug in Apache and there are already numerous such "bug" reports in the
database.  You are requesting a URL without a trailing "/", so Apache has
to send a redirect to correct it.  The hostname you are using and the hostname
configured into Apache (see ServerName and UseCanonicalName directives) are different, so your browser things it is a different site.
