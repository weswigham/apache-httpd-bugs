nmake /f Makefile.win installr
...
        if not exist "\Apache2.0\conf\httpd.conf"  copy "\Apache2.0\conf\httpd.default.con
f" "\Apache2.0\conf\httpd.conf"
The system cannot find the file specified.
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'if' : return code '0x1'
Stop.
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"c:\program files\devstudio\vc\bin\NMAKE.EXE"' : return code '
0x2'
Stop.
>How-To-Repeat:
nmake /f Makefile.win installr
>Fix:
No. But whatever is supposed to copy/create httpd.default.conf to the install
directory is not working.

Comment-Added:

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/win_compiling.html, we
haven't moved the awk.exe requirement to the 2.0 docs yet.

I'll be sure this happens when the 2.0 docs are rewritten
(there are many changes that remain undocumented.)

State-Changed-Why:

Beaten two ways, both politely failing and copying a raw
(worthless) httpd.default.conf template, and documented
these in win_compiling.html, to be distributed with 2.0.22.

Thanks for your report and interest in the Apache httpd
project!
