(should be irrelevant)	
>Description:
ab sends basic authorization line as:
Authorization: basic uuuencoodeddde==
instead of the proper(?):
Authorization: Basic uuuencoodeddde==
(note the capitalization)

This causes ab with authorization to fail with any web server that 
requires strict case sensitive Authorization line. (Microsoft IIS)	
>How-To-Repeat:
Try ab on a server that requires basic authentication.  (May only fail with
Microsoft servers, others untested.)
>Fix:
Change 'basic' to 'Basic' in ab.c

 This isn't an Apache bug; rfc2617 clearly states that the auth scheme is
 case-insensitive;
 
 1.2 Access Authentication Framework
 
    HTTP provides a simple challenge-response authentication mechanism
    that MAY be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a
    client to provide authentication information. It uses an extensible,
    case-insensitive token to identify the authentication scheme,
    followed by a comma-separated list of attribute-value pairs which
    carry the parameters necessary for achieving authentication via that
    scheme.
 
       auth-scheme    = token
       auth-param     = token "=" ( token | quoted-string )
 
 
 Cheers,
