>Environment:
Linux 2.0.0, gcc 2.7.2 but I don't think it matters
>Description:
In `Configuration', I put
EXTRA_LFLAGS= -L/data/mysql/lib
EXTRA_LIBS= -lmysqlclient

Then the sanity checker failed, saying `most likely your C compiler is not ANSI'. 
Actually it was because the command line constructed by TestCompile 
included the -lmysqlclient option without also the -L/data/mysql/lib option,
so the compilation was failing with `Cannotopen -lmysqlclient: No such file or directory` .
I added a line
EXTRA_LDFLAGS= $(EXTRA_LFLAGS) 
into Configuration, and the configure ran successfully.
