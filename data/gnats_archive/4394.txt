>Description:
I have just installed 1.3.6 on NT4 but SSI does not seem to work all other cgi is fine.
I notice from the known_bugs that the problem was in release 1.3.0 has it been
solved yet?

If not have you any idea when it will be fixed?

Many thanks

Paul

State-Changed-Why:
Can you please be more specific? SSI works last time I 
checked. Are you specifying 'Options includes' in your
configuration? Are you including the appropriate AddType 
and AddHandler directives in your config?

State-Changed-Why:
SSI's have been working on Win32 for several releases now. 
I suspect this is a config problem.
