fresh installation (without any IIS) after it didn't work on my first isntallation
>Description:
Parts of this Problem has already been mentioned in the bug report no "8284".
After Upgrading from Win2000 to Win XP (same apache conf-file) some sites only work locally while running apache (with IIS, or omni-httpd everything works fine). It doesn't matter which IP I use: from my LAN I can view all the sites correctly, but if I connect to the server over the Internet some sites (especially long tables and sites inclunding many ssi or php) are not shown correctly.
The remote client gets a "Site can not be displayed" error-message in the MSIE (in older MSIE-Versions (e.g. 4.0) "Error in the Microsoft Server-Extensions"); other browsers like netscape or opera under different OS timeout too.
Sometimes only some lines from the middle of the document are cut off by apache and the site is displayed but looks weird.
In the apache logfile "......./cmd.exe not found" occurs often.
I've even heard of other apache users in some newsgroups, but nobody was able to solve the prob.
Hope you to be able to use apache with winXP soon...

Thanks...
