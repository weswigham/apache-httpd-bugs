>Organization:
>Environment:
SunOS 5.7 gcc3.0.2 Apache 2.0.28 PHP4.1.1
>Description:
After some debugging, I found that the problem is clearly in Apache. There is a segmentation violation inside procedure cleanup_pool_for_exec from file apr_pools.c. I suspect field sub_pools from struct apr_pool_t beeing corrupted. This procedure is called just before an execve in apr_proc_create in apr/threadproc/unix/proc.c.
the siginfo is 
12114:	    Incurred fault #6, FLTBOUNDS  %pc = 0x00000000
12114:	      siginfo: SIGSEGV SEGV_MAPERR addr=0x00000000
12114:	    Received signal #11, SIGSEGV [caught]
12114:	      siginfo: SIGSEGV SEGV_MAPERR addr=0x00000000
>How-To-Repeat:
Just put LoadModule in http.conf
>Fix:
please read my description.
>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Mon Mar 25 23:00:25 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
php likely misregistered it's objects or cleanups, which
is why you would see this behavior.

However, 2.0.32 has a number of improvements, the forthcoming
2.0.34 introduces many more.  PHP4.0.12 should work well with
2.0.34 when that version is released.
