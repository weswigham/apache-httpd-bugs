>Description:
When a transmission via an intranet apache proxy (which forwards via 
ProxyRemote * http://firewall) receives a "short" file
(i.e., transmission stops before Content-Length bytes have arrived),
the short file is put into the cache nonetheless.

IMHO, this is the easiest situation to decide that the file should be invalidated (removed),
instead of happily re-serving the truncated file on a reload (if the reload
sends no no-cache header, as Mosaic does by default).
>How-To-Repeat:
Hmmm... can you force a truncated transmission? Should be possible via a
nph-Script with a Content-Length that is too big.
>Fix:
Remove temp file instead of putting it in cache hierarchy if it is too short
