I am proxying another server as
  ProxyPass /mirror/dcertp http://w3.dcertp.raleigh.ibm.com

When I click on a link to go to an html file that is hrefed as "news.html" from
http://wolf/mirror/dcertp, I would expect to get the file
http://wolf/mirror/dcertp/news.html. Instead I get http://wolf/mirror/news.html,
which fails. If I manually place the "dcertp" back into the URL, I get the
desired page.

 You are saying that requests for the file /mirror/dcertp should be
 satisfied from http://w3.dcertp.raleigh.ibm.com.  Apache has no reason to
 assume dcertp is a directory, because it could just as easily be a "file". 
 If you want /mirror/dcertp/ (ie. a directory) to refer to
 http://w3.dcertp.raleigh.ibm.com, you need to use /mirror/dcertp/ instead.
 
 Note that this means that you need to add an explicit redirect from dcertp
 to dcertp/ if you want people to be able to access
 http://wolf/mirror/dcertp and not just http://wolf/mirror/dcertp/.

State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Thu Apr 16 13:26:43 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

This is normal behaviour. The remote server sends
a redirect response and the browsers requests the
new location which was given in the response.

Apache 1.3b6 has a new directive called ProxyPassReverse
to work around this problem.

 Erm... no, that has nothing to do with it in this case because no redirect
 is sent for the root URL.  ProxyPassReverse does not fix this case.
