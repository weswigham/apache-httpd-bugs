>Environment:
WinNT 4
>Description:
When running apache as a service on NT options do not seem 
to be able to be passed to apache.  This includes the -f
option.  Without this support a person can not change the 
directory in which apache is assumed to be installed.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have some code that looks in the registry for the apache service and
then for a key that contains the path to the root dir.  This code
works but needs a little more work.  I can give you want I have
if desired.

The next beta (probably 1.3b6) will get the server root
location from the registry. Full details of the key
location and how to set it will also be available
when it is released.
