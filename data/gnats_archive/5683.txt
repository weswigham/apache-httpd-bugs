gcc 2.8.1 + 2.95.2, mipspro c 7.2.1  
>Description:
as already stated in #5239, #3766, #3506
on irix compiling with gcc results with 255.255.255.255 on $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'}
with 2.8.1 and 2.95.2 ! (so no improvements inbetween)
>How-To-Repeat:
now a cc apache 1.3.11

a gcc 2.8.1 apache 1.3.9
https://www.movabit.de:443/cgi-bin/test-cgi
>Fix:
use a mipspro compiler on IRIX/SGI saves you A LOT of trouble !
