>Description:
[Tried posting this to new-httpd, maybe that's not open to non-subscribers]
(Regarding PR#3910, PR#3806, PR#3575)

Can't get 100 continue handling in the error case working.
PR#3806 says it's fixed by the patch in #3910 - I don't think it is
(the patch fixes the NON-ERROR case.) Problem is the same with and
without the patch.

The problem is as described in PR#3806, but applies to ALL methods
not just POST.
>How-To-Repeat:
With, e.g. NO put handler installed:

PUT /foobar HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 1
Expect: 100-continue

<<<httpd waits for body, breaking draft-06
>Fix:
Ahhh... use IIS. Or you could try this change to ap_discard_request_body
(which works for me):

I have committed a similar, though more complete, change

>>>client sends body
<<<httpd returns the error
HTTP/1.1 405 blah blah

That's the error with no PUT handler. The same works when e.g., you DO have a PUT
handler, and authentication is turned on, then the server returns 401 after
waiting for the body, etc etc.
