>Description:
When cgis are called as SSI (exec cgi), or when ENVs are accessed via SSI (echo), QUERY_STRING and QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED have %xx converted to their respective characters.



As a side note, include virtual loses QUERY_STRING entirely, although it does have QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.hoboes.com/jerry/test.shtml?God=Excitable%20Boy&Bob=John%20Wesley

   will show all the ways that SSIs have the % characters parsed

http://www.hoboes.com/cgi-bin/Test.cgi?God=Excitable%20Boy&Bob=John%20Wesley

   will show the same cgi directly, with % characters not parsed, which I assume is the way it is supposed to be.
