Linux 2.2.14-2.2.16, egcs-2.91.66, Red Hat, Stronghold 2.4.2
>Description:
I am rewritting certain directories of our website to always be HTTPS, no matter what the HTML author put as the link or the submit. Trouble is, when non-HTTPS pages POST something to a script in these directories, the script does not get the POST data. If I change the form to a GET, it works fine. Also, if I change the URL to point to the script as an absolute HTTPS link, it works.

State-Changed-Why:

To the best of my knowledge, this is a browser issue.
All Apache can do is issue the redirect.  From there
the browser chooses whether or not to repost the
form data at the new location.
Thanks for using Apache.
