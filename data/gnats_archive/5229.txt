>Description:
Using RewiteCond -U I always get a 200 status code for any URL tested.
In the example below I try to test if /kkkkkk URL exists (it doesn't) 
and as shown by the attached logs it thinks the URL is OK.

And no, there is not another Alias or rewrite rule or anything that 
makes /kkkkkk a valid URL. It isn't, and should report 404, not 200.

It is possible that the problem is in ap_sub_req_method_uri.


RewriteLogLevel 9
RewriteCond /kkkkkk !-U
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !10.0.0.3
(...)
RewriteRule ^/med/.* /servlet/session [PT,NS]

10.0.0.4 - - [01/Nov/1999:20:10:46 +0100] [salud.hin/sid#806ce6c][rid#80b9034/subreq] (2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /kkkkkk
