>Description:
The REMOTE_USER variable is not set when a cgi script is executed
from a form created by another cgi script.
Both script are contained in a sub-directory of the cgi-bin directory and
the sub-directory contains a .htaccess file.
When the first script is executed, the proper authentication process takes
place and the REMOTE_USER variable is set.
When the second script is executed, the REMOTE_USER variable is not set and,
therefore, the script is unable to accertain if the user executing it passed
the authentication process.
A non authorized user could write a script which launces the second script
so bypassing all security checks.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. you should create a sub-directory of the cgi-bin directory.
2. you should put a .htaccess file in it.
3. you should create a script like this one:
     <form action="/cgi-bin/sub-dir/second-script" method="post">
     <select name="DirectoryCor">
     <option> any
     </select>
     <input type="submit" value="any">
     </form>
4. you should create a second script which echoes back the REMOTE_USER
   variable.
5. you should execute the first script, authenticate, then click on the
   submit button.
>Fix:
None.

State-Changed-Why:
I am quite sure that authentication is being required
wherever it is configured to be required.  If REMOTE_USER
isn't showing up, then it is because you don't have
authentication required for that request.  The fact that
it is a CGI executed from a form created by another
CGI has nothing to do with it.

Either your .htaccess file isn't working at all (eg. because
you have AllowOverride none or something similar set
for your cgi-bin directory) or you have some "Limit GET"
in there which, as it says, only limits GET requests.
