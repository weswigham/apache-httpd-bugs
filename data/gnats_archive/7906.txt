 Dear expect,
 
 My problem is:
 
 I can not access the successful page of Apache throught typing the following
 address:
 Eg. my localhost ip address is 192.0.0.123
 http://192.0.0.123/    and
 http://localhost/
 
 But I can access this page throught http://127.0.0.1/
 
 I had set the ServeName to 192.0.0.123 inside the httpd.conf file.
 
 Why I can access it? Please help me. Thank you.

This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
