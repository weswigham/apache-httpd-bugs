apache
>Environment:
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Mandrake Linux 8.1 2.96-0.62mdk)
Linux newgate.home.helplets.com 2.4.13-ac5 #1 Wed Oct 31 19:52:18 CET 2001 i586 unknown
glibc-2.2.4-6mdk
>Description:
glibc-2.2.4-6mdk has /usr/include/fnmatch.h which overrides the apache_1.3.22/src/include/fnmatch.h include file.

This causes ap_fnmatch.c to include a wrong file and fail with undeclared constants (FNM_CASE_BLIND)
>How-To-Repeat:
Download Apache 1.3.22 and try to compile it on Mandrake 8.1 (with glibc-devel installed).
>Fix:
Rename the file and update the includes.
