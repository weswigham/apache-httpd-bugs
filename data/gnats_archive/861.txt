>Description:
NCSA's <VirtualHost> directive allows for a feature I suggested to Brandon Long
a few years ago where one can specify the severity of a failure in parsing
the <VirtualHost> section.  This is the optional "Optional" designator:

<VirtualHost address Optional>

If provided, any error during parsing is totally ignored and the server
starts up normally.  If Optional is omitted, any error causes the server to
fail startup and doesn't run at all.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
This feature gives the admin the ability to control startup errors on
a host-by-host basis.  Since we run our servers with vhosts all configured
as Optional (and that behavior is Apache's default) we could omit the
Optional designator from our configs.  But if a site needs control over
both behaviors they're out of luck

 Have you read the dns-caveats.html page in the docs?  It goes over how to
 ensure things will work.  Before 1.2 it would fail if any of the dns
 lookups failed, and we had many complaints about that, hence we downgraded
 it to just a warning.  The NCSA syntax would mean we'd get those
 complaints all over again since few users bother reading any
 documentation.  And the syntax is incompatible with apache because we
 allow multiple names/ips on the <VirtualHost> line. 
 
 A site concerned that things are really working right would also need a
 monitoring setup to monitor their httpd ... and that would make the need
 for this feature kinda questionable.
