>Description:
I am trying to have host two virtual web site using name NOT ip.  The sites are 
behaving properly until I put the ServerAlias in.  The index.html of the server 
alias (min-com.inadco.net) is not the right one.  I displays the index.html of 
(www.inadco.net) instead of displaying the index.html of (www.min-com.html), but 
any other file then the index.html has not problems.  I try clearing cache, 
reloading my browser, tryed netscape 4.05 and explorer 4.01.


Relevant part of httpd.conf

NameVirtualHost 24.112.98.69

<VirtualHost 24.112.98.69>

>How-To-Repeat:


The following urls are working and give the right web page
http://min-com.inadco.net/index.html
http://www.min-com.inadco.net/
http://www.min-com.inadco.net/index.html

http://min-com.inadco.net/ should return the same index.html but instead it 
returns the index.html for http://www.inadco.net/

BUT
http://www.min-com.inadco.net/homes/homes_for_sale.html
http://min-com.inadco.net/homes/homes_for_sale.html
and most files I have tested work.

 It works fine for me.
 
 Are you sure you aren't using a proxy server that isn't reloading?  Did
 you try a shift-reload in your client?  Did you try doing it from a
 different system?

 I tryed with various browsers on various machine here, with the same 
 result, but as you mentioned, we are all behind a Netscape Proxy Server 
 version 1.0 here so that might be the problem.  
 
 I will check from another location within one hour and let you know

 I tryed again behind a squid proxy and a newer version of Netscape 
 Proxy, and the problem disapeared.  I guess I found a new bug in 
 Netscape Proxy Server 1.0.  Please close this bug report.
 
 
 Thanks for your time and effort.
