Comment-Added:
APR's configure script did not find a pthreads library on your
system.  Since you are using the mpmt_pthread MPM, you need
to have some sort of thread locks.

The configure script should have died when you tried to configure
a threaded MPM without a pthreads library.

Please run the following commands from your apache-2.0/src directory:

cd lib/apr
./buildconf
./configure --enable-threads > output

and send the output file to us.  If your platform does not have
a pthreads library, you will need one before Apache 2.0 will
compile with any MPM other than prefork.

To compile with a different MPM, in the apache-2.0/src
directory run ./configure --with-mpm=foo, where foo is the
name of the MPM.

 Checking for Threads...
 
 checking for threads... yes
 checking for pthreads_cflags... -pthread
 checking for pthreads_lib...
 checking for pthread.h... yes

 checking whether pthread_attr_getdetachstate takes one argument... no
 checking for pthread_key_delete... yes
 APR will use threads
 checking for readdir in -lc_r... yes
 checking for poll... yes
 
 The system supports pthreads...but looks like configure can't find the 
 library.
 
 Here is a list of the libraries on my system:
 /usr/shlib/libpthread.so
 /usr/shlib/libpthreaddebug.so
 /usr/shlib/libpthreads.so
 /usr/ccs/lib/lint/llib-lpthread.c
 /usr/ccs/lib/llib-lpthread.ln
 /usr/ccs/lib/libpthread.a
 /usr/ccs/lib/libpthreads.a
 /usr/lib/libpthread.a
 /usr/lib/libpthreads.a
 
 Although check this out from the pthread man page..it looks like cc may not 
 require you to specify the library if you use the -pthread library:
 
   For users of the Compaq C and C++ compilers, compile a multithreaded 
 appli-
   cation as follows:
 
    cc -c myprog.c -pthread
 
   For users of the Compaq C and C++ compilers, when linking your mul-
   tithreaded application that use DECthreads, include only the -pthread
   switch in the linker command line.  Note that this switch also directs the
   linker to search for thread-reentrant variants (named with the "_r" 
 suffix)
   of any libraries it searches.
 
  For users of other language environments or C and C++ compilers that do not
   support the -pthread linker switch, include these switches at the end of
   the linker command line:
 
    ld -o myprog myprog.o -lpthread -lexc -lc crt0.o
 
   or
 
    gcc -o myprog myprog.o -lpthread -lexc
 
  In this case, the -lpthread and -lexc switches direct the linker explicitly
   to use the DECthreads run-time and exception-handling libraries.  These
   switches must immediately precede the -lc switch (if specified), which
   directs the linker to use the libc run-time library.  If your application
   also requires specific thread-reentrant variants of libraries (such as the
   C run-time libraries), your linker command line must explicitly identify
   them or a search path for them.

State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 17 16:29:47 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
The issue.  We have found pthreads and we know how to compile properly.  Our autoconf script is able to determine that just using -pthreads will work on your system, and as soon as we know that, we also know that we don't need to use -lpthreads.  This is why it looks like we didn't find the library.  We could have found it, but we discovered we didn't need to.

So, after we discover that you have pthreads, we need to find a way to serialize between threads.  Unfortunately, this is done using a standard autoconf command AC_CHECK_FUNC.  AC_CHECK_FUNC uses the LIBS variable when it looks for pthread_mutex_init later in the config process.  If we found -pthread, then -lpthread is not in LIBS, and ld can't link a program with pthread_mnutex_init.

Would you please apply this patch to the configure.in script in src/lib/apr and let us know if this solves the problem?

This should force autoconf to look for pthread_mutex_init a second time with -lpthread in the LIBS variable.

 But the patch did get us further, correct?  I need to know so I can commit
 the change.  Once we get past this issue, I will start to tackle the next
 one.

 Do me a favor, and re-run ./buildconf from the apache-2.0/src
 directory.  It looks like something is really messed up with your
 autoconf.  AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS should be defining ac_config_sub.
