 I was wrong with the standard conf-file. php-module was installed. It
 contained the following added entries:
 
 LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll
 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
 
 PHP-Version: 4.04 win32

 After commenting out php module Standby behaves correctly. This is the same
 with 3.1.14 and 3.1.17. I sent a problem report to php as well.

State-Changed-Why:

User reports this behavior is an interaction with php and
Windows 9x/ME, and a bug report is filed with the php folks.
Cannot reproduce when php is not loaded.
