NT Workstation 4 Service Pack 3

>Description:
Cannot run a CGI executable in 1.3b7, which works in 1.3b6, due to the
CGI executable starting up with Current Working Directory
being C:\WINNT\system32.  In 1.3b6 the Current Working Directory was the
cgi-bin directory where the CGI executable is located.

The CGI executable does an fopen() with relative path to open a
needed configuration file, which is no longer found due to CWD
being different.

if (! (cfile = fopen("mimiweb.cnf", "r"))) {
   char currentpath[128], errormsg[512];
   getcwd(currentpath, 128);
   sprintf
    (errormsg, "Could not open configuration file: getcwd()=\"%s\"", currentpath);
   errorh(cgiOut, errormsg);
   return 0;
}
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile a simple CGI executable which just prints out the CWD and
exits, and note the difference in results between 1.3b6 and 1.3b7.

I haven't tried this in Perl (since I don't have that in NT),
but maybe this is the simplest way to repeat the problem.
>Fix:
Use a Win32 thread-safe way of setting current working directory
to where the CGI executable is loaded.
