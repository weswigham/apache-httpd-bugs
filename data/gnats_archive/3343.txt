>Environment:
Red Hat Linux with kernel version 2.0.35.  It has been patched to glibc2.0.7.
I am using gcc2.7.2.3, but the 1.2.6 server we were using
came with Red Hat Linux.

>Description:
There is no core dump.  The server-status report from the 1.2.6 apache server would
show processes marked as running although they no longer existed.  Once it reached the
maximum number of requests for a child, it would kill the child, but it would still
appear as running in the server-status report.  It would then start a new process, since it can't use the dead
ones.  After several hours it would reach the maximum number of processes and stop
answering requests.

The 1.3.3 version does not exibit the same behavior in the server status report, but
it still dies.

>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know what is causing it, so I can't repeat it.
You can access the server-status report at the following URL:

http://www.v6fbody.com/server-status/

The username and password are:
username: apache
password: group

The website address is http://www.v6fbody.com/
>Fix:
We started a cron job to restart the server on a periodic basis.

 Hi,
     Thanks for the quick reply.  Here are the settings you asked for:
 
 MaxRequestsPerChild is set to 64.  It was set to 30, but I increased
 it.  This seemed to make the server take longer to die.
 
 MaxClients is set to 150
 
 MinSpareServers is 5
 
 MaxSpareServers is 10
 
 BTW, we are running a custom transfer log, but we weren't when the
 problem started.  I noticed another message in the database regarding
 custom logs, but this shouldn't be the cause of the problem.
 
 There were no unusual messages in the error log file.  I also checked
 the syslog messages file, and I did notice several messages about
 possible SYN floods, but the times don't appear to correspond with the
 unresponsiveness of httpd.
 
 Thanks

 No.  NFS is disabled, and we did not compile any 3rd party modules into
 the server.  The only extra module that I enabled was the status
 module.  The server ran fine for about 6 months before this started.  Is
 there anything in the OS itself that may have changed to cause this
 problem?

 Did you upgrade your kernel version or any libraries, especially libc
 around when it started happening?

 No, we did not make any such changes to the machine since the end of Septemper.
 This problem started well afterwards.  It is a friend's machine, and he did tell
 me one thing that is interesting about this problem: it seems to be happening
 consistently between 6:30am and 8:30am CST.  We checked for cron jobs running at
 this time, and we didn't find any.  Are there any new attacks against the server
 that you know of that could cause this behavior?

 Hi,
     The server still dies, but we did find something that may be
 contributing to it.  We just are not sure why.  He runs a mailbag script
 that mails the traffic of his bulletin board to its subscribers every
 hour.  If he disables this script, the web server doesn't die.  We
 haven't found anything in this script that we believe would kill the web
 server, but if you would like to see it, I can forward it to you.
 
 Mark

When the problem happens, do a "netstat -nt" -- that should

I suspect something is just holding connections open.

If that doesn't help, use "strace" on a few of the children
to see what they're doing:

strace -p pid_of_child

Hey are you still having this problem?  You indicated that
it happens when some mailing list cron job runs.  Do you
use sendmail or qmail?

When the problem happens, could you use "strace -p pid_of_parent"
to find out what the parent is doing and mail me the output?

Thanks

 Also, please be aware of the fact that the problem seemed to have
 changed when we upgraded to the Redhat 5.2rpm version of Apache......
 now, instead of crashing every 20-24 hours, it is not expiring all
 requests, and eventually will lock up all available processes... I'll
 try and include a copy or you can view it yourself at
 http://www.v6fbody.com/server-status Login:apache Password:group
 
 Thank you.
