Using Windows 98 I start the apache server as delivered with one configuration
modification and that is to set listen=3000.  After starting Apache it will
terminate by itself after a minute or so with the following errors:
[Fri Nov 12 17:47:39 1999] [crit] (10045)(FormatMessage failed with code 317): Parent: WSADuplicateSocket failed for socket 184.

 According to MicroSoft a 10045 error is:
 
 WSAEOPNOTSUPP (10045)
 
    Operation not supported.
 
    The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced. Usually this occurs when a socket descriptor
    to a socket that cannot support this operation, for example, trying to accept a connection on a datagram socket.
 
 I still do not know what is causing the problem however since I originally reported the problem I thought that I would mention
 that I am using apache 1.3.9 with no modifications.  This "no modifications" statement means that I have not even modified
 the conf file.

 I have a fix which involves another product installed in my W98 machine.  I have Aventail Connect running in my machine and I
 had to include apache.exe in its application exclusion/inclusion list.  The text below was taken from the readme file of Aventail Connect.
 
 . Known Issues
 ----------------
 
 * Microsoft Internet Information Server/Microsoft Peer Web Server
 
 Microsoft webserver products include inetinfo.exe, which conflicts with Aventail Connect 3.01. To eliminate this
 conflict, add inetinfo.exe to the Application Exclusion/Inclusion List in the Config Tool. You may need to run
 Aventail Connect as a service. For more information, refer to the Aventail Connect Administrator's Guide

State-Changed-Why:
Never seen this one before... My guess is that we are
calling WSAStartup with the wrong winsock version. I have 
changes this in Apache 1.3.10, due out later this month.
Try it and post results back here. Thanks.
