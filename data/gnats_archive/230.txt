>Description:
I noticed (with dbx) that the processing of "HEAD / HTTP/1.0" => "/index.html"
looses the header_only for the sub request. This caused me problems since I
have local changes so that httpd does not demand authentication for HEAD
requests when local_addr == remote_addr (i.e. I want to be able to ask the
server something from a CGI C program about objects inside an authentication
zone.)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Set set_sub_req_protocol() would seem an appropriate place to inherit this.
(dbx) where
=>[1] set_sub_req_protocol(rnew = 0xcfb98, r = 0xcbb78), line 780 in "http_protocol.c"
  [2] sub_req_lookup_uri(new_file = 0xb7ad0 "index.html", r = 0xcbb78), line 617 in "http_request.c"
  [3] handle_dir(r = 0xcbb78), line 806 in "mod_dir.c"
  [4] invoke_handler(r = 0xcbb78), line 328 in "http_config.c"

  [6] process_request(r = 0xcbb78), line 986 in "http_request.c"
  [7] child_main(child_num_arg = 0), line 1771 in "http_main.c"
  [8] make_child(server_conf = 0xb4898, child_num = 0), line 1824 in "http_main.c"

  [10] main(argc = 4, argv = 0xeffff564), line 2227 in "http_main.c"

I changed this and it seems to fix the problem

A lot of issues concerning subrequest inheritance were
fixed in beta 1.2b8.  Would you please upgrade to that
version and let us know if the problem persists?
