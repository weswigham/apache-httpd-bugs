>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
OS is Debian with custom kernel (Linux yelm 2.0.34 #3 Tue Jun 9 22:05:47 PDT 1998 i586 unknown).
Compiler is egcs-1.0.3 prerelease.
>Description:
If proxy_ftp.c(ap_proxy_ftp_handler) gets a SIZE response, the newline in
the response is not stripped.  This results in a spurious newline being
inserted after the Content-Length HTTP header.  This in turn causes
subsequent headers to be interpreted as data instead of headers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Problem occurs when caching the any FTP response with a size header.
I first noticed the problem when fetching URLs like
    ftp://ftp.fuller.edu/debian/dists/unstable/contrib/binary-i386/Packages.gz
>Fix:
In ap_proxy_ftp_handler, add the following lines

--- /tmp/apache_1.3.0/src/modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c     Wed May 27 15:56:05 1998
+++ ./proxy_ftp.c       Thu Jun 11 05:35:39 1998

            if (i == 550) {     /* Not a regular file */
========================================================================
These lines were inserted here so that the new line is stripped
before possibly being printed by the Explain2 statement.
Otherwise, it would make more sense to move the lines down to
join the lines in the other "Size command ok" section about
thirty lines later.

 Also, the bug is not present in version 1.3b5.
 
 This bug is the same one reported in bug number mod_proxy/2367.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the hint and patch. I've taken your
fix idea but implemented it a little bit different
in proxy_ftp.c (other place and more strict digit parsing).
It is now comited for 1.3.1. Thanks for your report.
