>Description:
I am running a 2GB proxy partition.  I have given 777 priveleges to file and 
nobody.nobody owns the /proxy mount point for the partition. 
The server was working fine until I changed the partitions around, I changed 
the fstab file to point to the new mount partitiosn.
When the proxy cache gets to 43% disk usage of the drive it produces this error.
If I disable the cache( rem out CacheRoot) the problem goes away.
The error displays on the console of the FreeBSD machine.  
>How-To-Repeat:
The proxy cache is 2Gb.  The error occurs on 43% of proxy usage.
>Fix:
No.  I have no idea what an inode is.  Any suggestions greatly accepted.

State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 18 20:01:47 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Look at the manual page for newfs(8), in particular the -i
option. You probably want -i 1024 which will allow four
times as many files on the system.
Thanks for using Apache!
