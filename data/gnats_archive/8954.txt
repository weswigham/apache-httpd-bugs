>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 server w/SP2
IBM http server version
Dell 2500 dual 1.3 gHz, 2gig. of SDRAM
SCSI 
>Description:
Intermittantly the cpu utilization will increase to 50% then shortly after that to 100%. Stopping and restarting Apache temporarily fixes the problem.
I have the process priority set @normal.
>How-To-Repeat:
No one else in my group can do it on their Netfinitys (IBM), I'm the only one on Dell. 
>Fix:
I realize that your program (which works flawlessly for me under Linux)may not be the root of the problem, but have you ever heard of this before?
