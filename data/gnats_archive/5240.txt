NT 4.0 Server with SP5
>Description:
I have executed a program written in php3 on Linux and NT (on IIS and Apache).
The program is using SCRIPT_NAME, it works on NT/IIS and Linux/Apache, but not on NT/Apache.

SCRIPT_NAME, SCRIPT_FILENAME values are as follows:

1. NT/IIS

   SCRIPT_NAME = /script/debug.php3
   SCRIPT_FILENAME = 

2. Linux/Apache (using mod_php3 module)

   SCRIPT_NAME = /script/debug.php3
   SCRIPT_FILENAME = /home/httpd/ibbs/script/debug.php3

3. NT/Apache

   SCRIPT_NAME = /php3/php.exe
   SCRIPT_FILENAME = c:/program files/php3/php.exe

As you can see, it's the php executables not a script file name.
My program should run on multiple platforms.

Just print out environment variables.

State-Changed-Why:
From Rasmus (PHP God) Lerdorf:
Looks like an IIS bug to me.  Apache is doing the right
thing.  When PHP is running as a CGI script, which is the
only way to run it under NT as of PHP3, the PHP executable
is correctly identified as being the script being
run by mod_cgi.  When PHP is run as an Apache module, 
there is no cgi going on and the PHP script itself is the
script.  People looking to write PHP code that is portable
across the module and cgi versions should be using
$PHP_SELF to determine the current PHP script filename 
being executed.
