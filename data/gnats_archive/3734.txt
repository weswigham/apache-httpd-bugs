>Description:
    Hallo,
      I installed Apache 1.3.4 on Linux and on a PC WIN95, on both
      Systems (standart installation) I don't get the 
      Environment-variable      REMOTE_HOST

      with Version 1.3.1 (my last version) I get this Variable.
      What can I do. My CGI's need this Variable.
      
       The Variable REMOTE_ADDR is there.

ENV:
     DOCUMENT_ROOT=/httpd/htdocs
     HTTP_ACCEPT=image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*
     HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET=iso-8859-1,*,utf-8

State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 21 09:05:44 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This is entirely depending on your HostNameLookups setting.
As the CHANGES file clearly states, the REMOTE_HOST variable
is no longer set unless there is a hostname.
