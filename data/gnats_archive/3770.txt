>Environment:
The failure occurred on Apache 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 on Linux and OS/2 compiles.
The distribution binaries from www.apache.org website were used for the OS/2
test. The source distribution was used for the Linux test; gcc version 2.7.2.3.
>Description:
Using IndexOptions None for very simple directory indices shows extraneous
(garbage) data following the </A> in the file links.  The bad data usually
looks like data from the access_log file, but could be anything.
PLEASE NOTE: It doesn't appear to occur in the Parent Directory link, or in
any of the Directory links, but rather only after the file links themselves.
It appears that when IndexOptions None the variable "pad" is used without being
initialized and/or allocated, thereby pointing to random data.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the httpd.conf file, set IndexOptions None
Browse around some directories and you will see garbage data following the
file links after jumping around a random number of directories(3-5).
>Fix:
Of course!!! :)  This patch is for Apache 1.3.4 source distribution:
Apply this patch to mod_autoindex.c (patchname mod_autoindex.c.diff)
1244c1244
<                     "</A>", pad, NULL);

>                     "</A>", NULL);
