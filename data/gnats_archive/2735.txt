HP-UX 10.20
>Description:
We use htaccess files to restrict access to certain perl scripts within the
cgi-bin directories.
Previously (Apache 1.2.5) that worked fine (and also the use of htaccess
files within regular [non cgi-bin] directories still works) but since 1.3
it looks as if the htaccess files within our cgi-bin directories are simply
ignored.

State-Changed-Why:
Your AllowOverride directive is not set properly
for your cgi-bin directory.  If you wish to allow overrides
via htaccess files, you have to set it to something other than
AllowOverride None.

 That was indeed the problem.
 I overlooked that when going to 1.3 which had the explicit
 'AllowOverride none' specification for Directory / proposed
 in the httpd.conf.
 Thanks very much.
