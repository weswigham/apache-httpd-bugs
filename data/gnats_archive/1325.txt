>Description:
With 

RewriteEngine On
RewriteLog /logs/rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 0

at "top-level" in httpd.conf, I added a virtualhost section which included
some rewriting rules, the overall intention being to return an error for any 
access to that virtual host (wrong hostname used...) via a CGI script. The 
rewriting rules were an afterthought, and hence overlap the effect of the 
Directory section in the virtual host definition, which reads:

<VirtualHost cygnus.csx.cam.ac.uk>
TransferLog /logs/cygnus-access_log
ErrorLog /logs/cygnus-error_log
ErrorDocument 403 /cgi-bin/WrongServer
ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/WrongServer
<Directory /WrongServerData>
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
</Directory>
# Use rewrite rules to allow access to the WrongServer script but to
# treat all other paths as forbidden.
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/cgi-bin/WrongServer$ - [L]
RewriteRule . - [F]
DocumentRoot /WrongServerData
</VirtualHost>

That all seems to work, *except* that in spite of the RewriteLogLevel 0 
definition, rewrite_log still receives one log entry for each access, 
corresponding to the first ([L]) rule, e.g.

131.111.8.45 - - [28/Oct/1997:12:04:24 +0000] [cygnus.csx.cam.ac.uk/
sid#7d040][rid#930f0/initial/redir#1] (1) pass through /cgi-bin/WrongServer

(all on one line). 

[Additionally, I was slightly surprised to find that even with rewrite
log level increased to 9 (and with the <Directory> section commented out in case
that was taking precedence, nothing was being logged in rewrite_log for the
second RewriteRule, the one yielding "forbidden" and thus triggering the 
error document.]

Thus, even with rewrite logging nominally disabled, some entries are written
to the log, which is presumably a bug. It may also be a bug that 
the second rule does not result in a log entry when logging is enabled (even
at the highest level), but there may be some valid reason for that (e.g. 
as a side-effect of it triggering an ErrorDocument).

I first noticed this with Apache 1.2.3, but subsequently confirmed that
the behaviour of 1.3b2 is similar.

State-Changed-Why:
I'll try this out in the next days.
But although I'm using virtual hosts on all my
servers (even on those where only one website resists)
I never encountered this case. And there are websites
which really have rewrite log disabled. Hmmm...
I'll investigate...

State-Changed-When: Thu Feb 26 03:08:06 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Both problems should be now fixed in 1.3b6-dev.
The problem with the RewriteLoglevel 0 was just a bug.
The default was set to 1 instead of 0 on init.
The second problem with the mysterious inheritance
of directives should be fixed also because the merging
of config directives between main and virtual servers
was totally bogus. This was now cleaned up for 1.3b6-dev,too.
