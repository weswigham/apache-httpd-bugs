Hi Oliver,

www.bpmarine.com has since been moved to a new box, the web server only
serves the pages for old DNS data hanging around. Since sending the
Email to Dean it's been cleaned out of the config files.

www.shatz.com is comming over to our servers, and so the data is set up
so that using bind on the local machine it resoves to 193.243.233.97 so
that when the DNS changes propagate the web server will be on-line and
waiting.

The problem occurs with www.guernseyci.com, which appears to become the
default server (i.e. if people type in http://193.243.233.97/), as well
as the server for www.sbc.org.uk.
