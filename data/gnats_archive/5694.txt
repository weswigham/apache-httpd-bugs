>Description:
In src/main/http_main.c setup_listeners() there is a call to make_sock().
The return value is unchecked.  make_sock can return -1 in certain circumstances.
Have seen this if FD_SETSIZE is too small.

Result: apache complains about FD_SETSIZE (elsewhere), but continues in its
attempt to startup.  Keeps fork()ing and these children keep failing, because
they attempt to perform socket operations on fd -1.
>How-To-Repeat:
Perhaps by setting FD_SETSIZE to a small value in 'apaci' and compiling?
>Fix:
My amendment was to change part of setup_listeners() so that it checks the
return value of make_sock().  I can accept that the exit value is a little
arbitrary:
            fd = make_sock(p, &lr->local_addr);
            if (fd == -1) { /* [ this was my work mail address ] */
                ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_EMERG, NULL,
                        "Failed to create the socket to listen on, "
                        "(attempt was for port %d)", ntohs(lr->local_addr.sin_po
rt));
                exit(42);
            }
