 I have narrowed this down a little.  It actually doesn't seem to have muc=
 h to
 do with the original subject (--enable-shared=3Dmax).  I have actually
 reproduced the bug without that option.  It simply seems to be a DL probl=
 em. =
 
 I haven't, however, found any particular configurations that cause the
 problem.  It seems to be random.  Looking in the /server-info directory, =
 I see
 that the module has loaded, but the "init" function never seems to be cal=
 led. =
 
 If I load all the modules of interest statically, there is no problem at =
 all.

 Sorry, but then the Frontpage module is broken.  At least I cannot image why
 this is Apaches fault.  The --enable-shared=max just enables DSO for the
 module. When it later fails to load it has some symbol references which fail
 to resolve it it's broken in another way.  Contact the author of the Frontpage
 module, please.
