>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows NT, JDK1.2, JSDK2.0, ajpv12.
>Description:
when shutting down Apache server by running "Apache -k shutdown", 
Apache suppose to send Jserv a shutdown signal to do any cleanup.
However, somehow Jserv doesn't get the shutdown signal. Hence, it
doesn't call servlets' destroy methods. 
This works fine with Apache1.3.6 and Jserv1.0.5b, which use ajpv11.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a simple servlet that create/write some file in the destroy() method.
Invoke this servlet. Shutdown Apache server. The file is not created - this
mean the destroy() method is not invoked.
Repeat the same with Apache1.3.6 and Jserv1.0.5b, the file is created -- this
mean the destroy() method was invoked. 
>Fix:
I exam the Java code in Jserv. It seems to be ok. I Suspect that the C code
in mod_jserv mishadle the protocol. Unfortuately, I don't have a C devlopment
enviroment setup.

 We don't support old versions of the software.
 
 upgrade to Apache JServ 1.1 release and Apache 1.3.9 or higher.
