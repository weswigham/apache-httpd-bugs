>Description:
I am trying to use mod_setenvif to protect a directory from being access
unless the referer is my own web site.  This seems to work with regular
.html documents, but no matter what it won't allow me to access <APPLET>
code:

Here's excerpts from my access.conf

   SetEnvIf Referer www\.laromance\.com laromance

   Alias /java/  /var/apache/laromance/java/

   <Directory /var/apache/laromance/java>
   AllowOverride None
   Options None
   order deny,allow
   deny from all
   allow from env=laromance
   </Directory>

Here's output from my access_log/error_log files:

   207.155.46.22 - - [14/Jul/1998:16:09:58 -0700] "GET /java/HelloWeb.class HTTP/1.1" 200 891

   207.155.46.22 - - [14/Jul/1998:16:09:58 -0700] "GET /java/HelloWeb.class HTTP/1.1" 200 891

Here's my Apache version

   Apache/1.3.0 (Unix) mod_perl/1.12

Here's my HTML code:

<APPLET CODEBASE="/java/" CODE="HelloWeb.class" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200>
<PARAM NAME="user" VALUE="%u">
[HelloWeb applet]
</APPLET>

>How-To-Repeat:

If you would like access to our server in way, please let me know and I can make it available to you.

 Erm... just what do you expect to be denied?
 
 If someone accesses a page on your site that loads /java/HelloWeb.class
 then of course the refer will be from your site.
 
 The only time you would expect differently is if you had the above HTML on
 a different server and changed the URL to point to your server.

 That's what we want to block; other servers from accessing our Java code.
 We are going to have a membership-based site and want to make sure
 that the world can only access our site and java applets through
 pre-determined channels.
 
 We only want Apache to allow access to /java/ if it's coming from our
 server.
 
 This is working as far as references to .html documents in the directory.
 If the referer is "www.laromance.com" it sends the document.  If it's not
 from us, it rejects it.  The server is ALWAYS rejecting the <APPLET>
 tag, regardless of whether it came from our server or not.
 
 I don't know if this is a bug, or a feature.  The documentation does not
 make it clear to me.  From my understanding of the modules, this is good
 way to protect our java applets and should work.
 
 Thank you for the quick response.
 
 We've been using Apache as a basic web server for several years.  Only
 recently have I discovered the true power of it.  Apache is magic.

 One other thing that might help, the GET request produced from
 
    <APPLET CODEBASE="/java/" CODE="HelloWeb.class" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200>
 
 shows up in "access_log" but not "referer_log".

 Oh.  That isn't what the logs you showed me showed.  They showed a 200
 response, ie. not any sort of access denied.

 This is almost certainly not Apache's fault.  It doesn't know or care
 about class files.  What I'm guessing that you are running into is some
 clients not sending a referer header when they load applets.  Not much
 Apache can do about that; if it doesn't send the header, it doesn't send
 it.

State-Changed-Why:
Many clients don't send referers for servlet requests; it
is arguable if they should or shouldn't.

Either way, if Apache doesn't get a referer it can't filter
on it...

 Bingo.. that must be it.  Looks like we'll have to look at having the
 client handle the verification and leave Apache out of it.  Would have
 been sweet to have Apache deal with it.
 
 Thank you for taking the time to look at this.
