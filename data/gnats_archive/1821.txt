>Environment:
Windows 95, 4.00.950 B
CGI C library: CGIC 1.05 by Thoams Boutell
Precompiled Apache for Windows executable
>Description:
We are using CGI programs written in C/C++ on Win95. After the second
execution of such a CGI program Apache hangs. The same programs work fine
under Linux. The problem does not always occur. Smaller programs
do not always cause the problem.
We tried different compilers (GCC and Borland) but this did not
make any difference.

Sorry, we can't give our source code away.

No idea

State-Changed-When: Wed May 20 03:26:33 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The current CVS tree now uses the Win32 CreateProcess call
to spawn CGI (and other) processes.  This should address
the CGI hang problem.  1.3b7 will be released at the end of
this week and should address this; if you want to test it
before then, you can grab a snapshot from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/
though you'll have to compile it yourself.

Let us know whether or not that fixes your problem.

 We finally found a workaround for our problem: we switched off any
 debug statements writing to stderr in our CGI C programs.
 We haven"t yet tested the 1.3b7 release.
 
 Thanks for your reply.
