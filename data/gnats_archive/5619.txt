>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
IRIX64 info4u 6.5 04151556 IP27
Compiler: gcc
>Description:
If a request contains an URL that in turn contains the escape '%2E' followed
by a C-language floating-point format specifier, and if the requested file
does not exist the httpd will hang.  At least on SGI systems.

>Fix:
The bug is in src/main/http_core.c.  The lines:
        char *emsg;

        emsg = "File does not exist: ";
        if (r->path_info == NULL) {
            emsg = ap_pstrcat(r->pool, emsg, r->filename, NULL);
        }
        else {
            emsg = ap_pstrcat(r->pool, emsg, r->filename, r->path_info, NULL);
        }
        ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR|APLOG_NOERRNO, r, emsg);
are wrong, because "emsg" is used as format and can contain a percent
sign when it is also in the URL.  Note that the error is apparently fixed in
the 2.0 CVS tree.
This bug is important enough to also fix in the latest release.
