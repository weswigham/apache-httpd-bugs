RedHat 6.0, kernel 2.2.5-15smp on i686
>Description:
I'm not sure whether this is related to the old AOL bug, but I have reports of
clients using AOL version 3 on MacOS8.5 not being able to view any of our Apache sites.

They are reporting a hang - the timer cursor appears and the page never displays
(the browser doesn't actually 'hang' ie. crash).
>How-To-Repeat:
Well, www.bluecheese.co.uk from an AOL version 3 dialup? Looking through the logs,
there are AOL 5.0 users who don't seem to have a problem (they are viewing more
than one page). There is ONE AOL 3.0i Mac user who also didn't appear to 
experience any problems. Alright - I don't know.
