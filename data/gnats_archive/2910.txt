Win NT 4.0, sp3, VC++, Apache 1.3.1
>Description:

Before a CGI finishes sending output (using cout or printf), if user
clicks on the STOP botton on the browser (breaks the connection), the
CGI will turn into a zombie.

My guess is that when the pipe is broken, the CGI is blocked on calls
like cout, printf or fprintf(stdout, ...).
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a simple CGI than print out 50,000 lines. Before it finishes, 
click STOP button on browser. Use Task Manager to look for the zombie.

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for the recreate description.
The problem was indeed that the server side pipe
handles were being inherited by the CGI when
they should not have been.
The fix has been committed to CVS for file alloc.c.
You should be able to get the fix in the next release
of Apache or the latest CVS tree.

Thanks for using Apache.
