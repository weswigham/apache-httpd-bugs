>Description:
Since Hiway Technologies installed 1.2b, our SSI invoked CGIs have failed. Before, exec cmd= was supported. Now it doesn't work at all. exec cmd= does work, but does't support parameter passing (or if it does, the ? gives and error).

I am not the only one experiencing this problem. There are others on Hiway's machines that are. Hiway asked me to contact you. If you need more information, please contact stevem@hway.net

Works fine here.  Try invoking one in the same directory or using "include
virtual" instead of exec cgi.  

This is something that really needs to be taken up with the person
maintaining the web server since we have no way to know what they have
done.  

If they have installed suEXEC (program to run CGIs as the user) that could
change things, but it is simply wild guessing to try to say anything
without knowing the server setup.
