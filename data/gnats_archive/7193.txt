>Description:
Hello,

I did not test this alot
but i managed to reproduce it on the above envoirnments

Basically
my cgi-bin's are all in:

/www/CGI-BIN

For this directory if i use:

<Directory /www/CGI-BIN/>
Options MultiViews
</Directory>

Restart apache and then run a cgi script
lets say

http://search.apache.org/index.cgi

The script runs - no problems
but if i do:

http://search.apache.org/index

I get the source code of the cgi
(NOTE i am using search.apache.org as an EXAMPLE - it does NOT work here)

If i removed MultiViews from the options this fixes the problem.

I tried this with the CGI-BIN inside and outside the webroot - both displayed the cgi source code when MultiViews was enabled.


Can you tell me what's going on here?
is this a known bug?
>How-To-Repeat:

# mkdir -p /www/WWW/your-host.com

Put the following in your config file:
<Directory "/www/WWW/">
Options MultiViews
</Directory>

<VirtualHost Your-host.com>
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/www/WWW/cgi-bin/"
 DocumentRoot /www/WWW/your-host.com/
 ServerName your-host.com
</VirtualHost>

put a cgi script in the cgi-bin for your-host.com

check to see if it runs
if it does
then access the cgi script WITHOUT its extension.
