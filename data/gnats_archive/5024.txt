>Environment:
Linux linuxmafia 2.2.12 #8 Sat Sep 11 21:10:52 CDT 1999 i686 unknown
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
glib-2.1.2
Using Unix98 PTY's
Apache built with shared=max running mod_frontpage, mod_perl, php4, mod_roaming.
>Description:
This may be due to the unix PTY's or some other setting on the box but I have no way of
trying to see what it could be.  A strace on htpasswd reveals this:

open("/dev/tty", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3
ioctl(3, TTY_MAGIC, {B38400 opost isig icanon echo ...}) = 0
ioctl(3, TCSETSF, {B38400 opost -isig icanon -echo ...}) = 0
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_ISGID|0400, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x40014000
ioctl(3, TTY_MAGIC, {B38400 opost -isig icanon -echo ...}) = 0
write(3, "Re-type new password: ", 22Re-type new password: )  = 22
read(3, "test\n", 4096)                 = 5
write(3, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
ioctl(3, TCSETSF, {B38400 opost isig icanon echo ...}) = 0
close(3)                                = 0
munmap(0x40014000, 4096)                = 0
time(NULL)                              = 937525822
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
I do not know how to trace when a child dies the server remains running when this happens
when calling the FP module which I know is not your worries but it may be related at least 
I think it may.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run UNIX98 ptys and possible it may be glibc related as well not sure.
>Fix:
None what so ever, I would like to know if it is a bug or not if you have time to 
reply so I can look at something else.  If you need access to the machine let me know as well
Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
If these problems do not occur when you are using only the
base Apache modules, then we cannot help you.  None of the
modules you named are part of the package we support.  If
you can reproduce the problem when they are not included in
your configuration, we can look at it -- otherwise we need
to refer you to the support paths for those modules, since
the problem would seem to lie with one (or more) of them.
