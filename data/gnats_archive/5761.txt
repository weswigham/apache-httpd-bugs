>Environment:
I'm running Apache 1.3.9 shipped with SuSE Linux 6.3 with only a few
modifications in the configuration file.
>Description:
I'm not sure whether it is a bug or not, but I can't get it from the
documentation: I've written a (smart?) CGI script in Perl (say X.pl).
The script uses `path_info()' so that it can be called like `X.pl',
`X.pl/a', `X.pl/c/d' and `X.pl/b/d'. I had in mind to use the first "directory"
after the script name as "function", and to assign a different
AuthName (and other) for each Location (e.g. ``<Location "X.pl/b>'').
It seems Apache either does not request different authorization realms
or the browser (Netscape 4.7) does not prompt for auth info.
>How-To-Repeat:
Example entry: <Location "cgi-bin/X.pl/a">
AuthName "bug report"
AuthType Basic
require user windl </Location> # on next line
>Fix:
Could it be that Netscape does not prompt for user and password for
a new realm if the combination entered last allows access?
