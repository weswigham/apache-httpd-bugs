>Description:
while i was away, apache started sending out empty documents as response to all 
requests to domains on my server.  ran "apachectl stop" to gracefully kill the 
pid then "apachectl start" to bring server back up.  after the start, received 
these messages: 

/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl: line 184: 16904 Segmentation fault   $HTTPD
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

rebooted server (power reset) and everything started fine again.
>How-To-Repeat:
unknown.
