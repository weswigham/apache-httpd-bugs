>Environment:

SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
When we feel the site response speed is slow, we restart Apache server. Sometime
the improvement is very little. It seems that some httpd process instances hung
even though they look like healthy, so that the server restart act would not
help too much. What's the possible causes for this ? Does reboot the server 
help ? Are there any other solutions other than reboot ?

The error log shows something like "Caught SIGTERM, shutting down" and "child
pid xxxxx exit signal segmentation fault"

Prompt responses are highly appreciated.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:

Reboot. But it seems not a good solution, especially in the peek hours.

 You really don't give us much to go on.
 
 Do you have any extra modules compiled into Apache?
 
 What do you mean you "feel" site response speed is slow?  Do you have
 anything to quantify this?  Do you look at what the system is doing at
 that time to see why it is slow?  What does mod_status say?
 
 
 What sort of traffic do you get?
 
 You don't even say what version of Apache you are using!  We can't give
 you answers without you telling us the basics such as the information
 requested in the submission form.
