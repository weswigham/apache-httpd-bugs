>Description:
Tried compiling module using apxs this is what I get:
bash# ./apxs -c /var/apacheinst/mod_auth_pam.c
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 67, next 2 tokens "use strict"
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 74, next 2 tokens "my $CFG_TARGET "
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 99, next 2 tokens "my $opt_n "
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 119, next 2 tokens "my ("
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 192, next 2 tokens "my $rc"
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 195, next 2 tokens "1 and"
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 196, next 2 tokens "not $opt_q "
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 205, next 2 tokens "my ("
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 208, next 2 tokens "my ("
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 210, next 2 tokens "$var and"
./apxs has too many errors.

I have checked to make sure mod_so.so is installed which it is
bash# ./httpd -l
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_so.c <-*****
  mod_setenvif.c
suexec: disabled; invalid wrapper /var/apache/bin/suexec 

>How-To-Repeat:
Use the module out of the /src/module/example and try using apxs to compile it.

bash# ./apxs -c /var/apacheinst/mod_auth_pam.c
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 67, next 2 tokens "use strict"
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 74, next 2 tokens "my $CFG_TARGET "
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 99, next 2 tokens "my $opt_n "
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 119, next 2 tokens "my ("
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 192, next 2 tokens "my $rc"
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 195, next 2 tokens "1 and"
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 196, next 2 tokens "not $opt_q "
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 205, next 2 tokens "my ("
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 208, next 2 tokens "my ("
syntax error in file ./apxs at line 210, next 2 tokens "$var and"
./apxs has too many errors.
