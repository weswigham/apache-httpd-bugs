>Description:
I have a cgi that does two system calls.  One to the date program and one to
the clock program.  If I set the time ahead the cgi dies before printing out
the next screen.  The timeout function in the function http_main.c.

State-Changed-Why:

There is really nothing we can do about this.  By changing
the system time you're causing existing timers within the
interval of the change to expire immediately.  If your
script is just trying to change the time and then display
a confirmation, try doing this in two steps.  Try having
the script emit HTML that includes something like this in
the <HEAD> portion:

 <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT='5; URL="http:..url-of-confirmation-page"'>

and then close the output stream and change the time.  Most
browsers will load the confirmation page after five seconds
have passed, which should be enough for the first script
to have finished its work.

Thanks for using Apache!
