Linux rossg 2.0.33 #11 Sun Mar 22 16:19:48 /etc/localtime 1998 i686 unknown
>Description:
When using MSIE4, and using the Session interface, the browser has a habit of sending lines like the following in the HTTP request header :-

Cookie: MC=ID=12345; JServSessionId=<session_num>

JServUtil.parseCookieHeader(String) incorrectly parses these into name/value pairs such as MC=ID; 12345=JServSessionId; <session_num>=null.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the commonly-found SessionServlet with Internet Explorer 4.
>Fix:
I have applied a patch to JServUtil in CVS, which I have found solves the problem satisfactorily.

State-Changed-Why:
since this is fixed in CVS, I'm going to mark it suspended
until a checkpointed version of 1.0 is released.
