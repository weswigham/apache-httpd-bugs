State-Changed-Why:

If you still have the described problem with
Apache 1.3.3 then please give us some more details
about your system setup: Name and version of Linux
distribution. What libc and compiler versions
are you using? Do you use any custom or third party
Apache modules?

Are you able to reproduce the problem on an other
Linux machine (I was not able to reproduce it)?
