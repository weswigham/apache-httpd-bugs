>Release:        1.2b4
>Environment:
SunOS 5.5, gcc
>Description:
There is no call to setlocale(LC_ALL, "") so there is no locale-support
(e.g. for the time format in mod_include.c).
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a SSI-document with a line like <!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"--> and set 
different locale's e.g. with "setenv LANG XY" (restart server after every try).
The displayed format for full or abbreviated weekdays will NOT change and is
still displayed in english!
>Fix:
Insert a call to "setlocale(LC_ALL, "");" in some central place (http_main.c)
so that the used locale will be set according to the environment variable LANG.
I'm not sure where to place this call, because I'm not very familiar with all
the code. You know better ...%0

State-Changed-Why:
You are correct that some consideration should be given
to this issue.  It has been discussed, and the option of
just putting in a setlocale() call at the start of the 
program is a bad thing because it has some wide ranging
changes, including things like log files which other programs
often expect to be in a certain format.  The idea of just
changing it for things like mod_include has also been
proposed, but that gets complicated and is not appropriate
in all situations.  It really should be configurable somehow
via a config file option, but that won't come until
after 1.2.  I don't think anyone on the Apache team
uses locales much, so we have to be very careful.  If
implemented incorrectly, they cause headaches.
