>Environment:
Linux 2.0.26 - Using PERL 5.003_16 with afio for FCGI module
>Description:
After a set amount of time and usage, my fastCGI applications fail
/stop responding..
When doing a PS -lxaw on the system, I notice the FCGI apps are left in
the kernel state unix_data_wait, when they should (and normally are) in the
unix_accept state..
Restarting the CGI app does NOT fix the problem, so it sounds like it is possibly
located in the server, as a server restart/reload is the only way of fixing
this..
I have tried with both the supplied mod_fastcgi.c and also with the mod_fastcgi.c
that comes from www.fastcgi.com
This happenes with 1.2b1, 1.2b3 and 1.2b4 (I never tried 1.2b2)

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 24 16:43:49 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
mod_fcgi is not maintained by the Apache group and will no
longer be included in the server in future releases.  This
appears to be a problem with the module, so please contact
the authors (http://www.fastcgi.com/) to report this bug.
