I am adding the servertoken line to the httpd.conf file, stopping the server, then restarting, 
--cut httpd.conf--
ServerTokens ProductOnly
--end cut httpd.conf--

however, when I telnet localhost and do a HTTP://1.1 POST, I get the following:
--cut output--
web2: # telnet localhost 80
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
