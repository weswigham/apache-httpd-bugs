State-Changed-Why:
<SCRIPT> is handled by the client, Apache has nothing to
do with it.  Is finesse-big a ScriptAliased cgi directory?
If so, why are you putting a html file in there?  Apache
is obviously trying to run it as a script.  Put the file where
your normal files are and you won't have this problem.
If it isn't a CGI, don't put it in a CGI directory.

 You really need to go through your configuration again.  For whatever
 reason, your Apache is setup so that it thinks test.html is a CGI.
 Otherwise it would not try to run it.  The error log message clearly
 indicates it is trying to execute it as a CGI.  If you remove the contents
 from it and just put a single line of text in test.html, does it still
 have the same problem?

 If I have plain HTML without using the <SCRIPT> </SCRIPT> it works 
 absolutly fine it appears only to this one directive which doesn't work
 
 The error_log seam to suggest the <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"> is more 
 incomplete reather than unacceptable.
