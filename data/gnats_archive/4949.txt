>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT Server/Workstation 4.0 with SP4 and SP5
>Description:
Under NT, content negotiation failed to find a match for files whose names contain uppercase characters.
>How-To-Repeat:
To repeat this problem, set MultiViews on for a directory, such as:

<Directory "c:/Apache/htdocs/">
Options MultiViews
...
</Directory>

Add or uncomment language extensions specifications:

DefaultLanguage en
AddLanguage en .en
AddLanguage fr .fr
LanguagePriority en fr

And then create the following files:

c:\Apache\htdocs\foobar.html.en
c:\Apache\htdocs\foobar.html.fr
c:\Apache\htdocs\FOOFOO.html.en
c:\Apache\htdocs\FOOFOO.html.fr

Restart the server.  Set up your browser to prefer French over English (methods vary by manufacturer/model).  And then point to:

http://<host>:<port>/foobar             [returns: foobar.html.fr correctly]
http://<host>:<port>/FOOFOO             [returns: ERROR 404]
http://<host>:<port>/foobar.html        [returns: foobar.html.fr correctly]
http://<host>:<port>/FOOFOO.html        [returns: ERROR 404]
>Fix:
The log file error.log reports the following: 

File does not exist: c:/apache/htdocs/foofoo

which leads me to believe that the requested filename has been converted to all lowercase characters, which is possibly the cause of the mismatch.  However, access.log reports:

"GET /FOOFOO HTTP/1.1" 404 287

with the right case (uppercase).

 A workaround that I've tested under NT 4.0 and Apache 1.3.6 is to use the type-map handler.
 The only drawback to this approach is that I have to replace my URLs to have the extension
 .var.

State-Changed-Why:

So far as I am aware, FOOFOO.html.en cannot coexist with
the file foofoo.html.en in the ntfs file system.  If I'm
wrong, please correct me.  I'm suspecting you had only
two different files (the .en and .fr) at a given moment.
