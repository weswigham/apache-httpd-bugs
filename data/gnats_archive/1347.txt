Apache 1.2.4 just downloaded from your site.
>Description:
I have some protected pages that are used by sales person's to add new users on-line. The pages need to serve as root.

The pages run a CGI to modify the passwd file and add the new customer, then send an email to me.

I changed User to server, with group #0 and tried #-1 in the httpd.conf

In the passwd file I created server:passwd:0:0:/root:/bin/bash

tried different euid numbers etc.. but it will work everything else except the  secured pages. I don't want to open a Security Hole but would like to get the new release to work. It does not give this error with the release I now have 1.2b7

Received that apache was not designed to serv pages as root. I tried different changes to the passwd config but then the server user does not have permission to access.

Any help would be great.

Thank you
Bob Ross

State-Changed-Why:
What you are doing was a very poor security practice before
and is still a very poor security practice.

You could make your CGI setuid root, make a special group
for your server, and then make it only group (ie. not world)
executable.  That still isn't very smart security practice,
because it means if anyone compromises your http server
they can likely gain root.

If you wish to disable the check for running as uid0,
it is explained clearly how to do so in the error message
generated when you try.  This will leave you with something
just as insecure as your old setup.

We really can't go step by step through the ways you can
accomplish what you want; you could try asking in the
appropriate Usenet newsgroup, but be aware that it takes
a good bit of knowledge about security to do what you want
safely.

 Thanks,
 
 I'll have to re-write the cgi to work in the back ground instead of from a
 form. Would not be to much trouble to set a cron to look for a file and then
 process the information in it.
 
 Thank for your reply.
