>Description:
[Wed Jul 28 12:07:39 1999] [error] [client 209.63.195.8] (2)No such file or directory: could not open dbm auth file: /web/db/userdbs/woodfamily
We've compiled Apache 1.3.6 with gdbm support, but get the following errors when trying to authenticate.

[Wed Jul 28 12:07:39 1999] [error] [client 209.63.195.8] DBM user dale not found: /web/html/stores/woodfamily/inc
[Wed Jul 28 12:07:43 1999] [error] [client 209.63.195.8] (2)No such file or directory: could not open dbm auth file: /web/db/userdbs/woodfamily
[Wed Jul 28 12:07:43 1999] [error] [client 209.63.195.8] DBM user dale not found: /web/html/stores/woodfamily/inc

The contents of the file are below:
admin: byMVkOkdnxV4U
apw: q8vFYoMsCW.Ow
dale: om.UxVnd8WHog

We have no problems authenticating from a text file.  Also, Apache 1.3.4 (which we currently use),
authenticates with no problems using the same gdbm files.
