 When caching HTTP, as a proxy server might do, the Set-cookie response header should never be cached. )

 You are right, somethng is not correct here, looking at rfc261, which
 skimps the issue(though does list a number of prama's we really should
 check for), and rfc2109. 
 
 But as you can see it needs a few more check's for other headers to be
 compliant with rfc2109, which is a standards track document. And I'd
 prefer to go that way. I will look into this tomorrow. I am still looking
 for anything authoritative for http/1.0 but I fear that it does not exist.
 
 In which it makes sense to follow the gist of your suggestion.
 
 Dw.
 
 From 2109:
 
 4.2.3  Controlling Caching
 
    An origin server must be cognizant of the effect of possible caching
    of both the returned resource and the Set-Cookie header.  Caching
    "public" documents is desirable.  For example, if the origin server
    wants to use a public document such as a "front door" page as a
    sentinel to indicate the beginning of a session for which a Set-
    Cookie response header must be generated, the page should be stored
    in caches "pre-expired" so that the origin server will see further
    requests.  "Private documents", for example those that contain
    information strictly private to a session, should not be cached in
    shared caches.
 
    If the cookie is intended for use by a single user, the Set-cookie
    header should not be cached.  A Set-cookie header that is intended to
    be shared by multiple users may be cached.
 
    The origin server should send the following additional HTTP/1.1
    response headers, depending on circumstances:
 
    * To suppress caching of the Set-Cookie header: Cache-control: no-
      cache="set-cookie".
 
    and one of the following:
 
    * To suppress caching of a private document in shared caches: Cache-
      control: private.
 
    * To allow caching of a document and require that it be validated
      before returning it to the client: Cache-control: must-revalidate.
 
    * To allow caching of a document, but to require that proxy caches
      (not user agent caches) validate it before returning it to the
      client: Cache-control: proxy-revalidate.
 
    * To allow caching of a document and request that it be validated
      before returning it to the client (by "pre-expiring" it):
      Cache-control: max-age=0.  Not all caches will revalidate the
      document in every case.
 
    HTTP/1.1 servers must send Expires: old-date (where old-date is a
    date long in the past) on responses containing Set-Cookie response
    headers unless they know for certain (by out of band means) that
    there are no downsteam HTTP/1.0 proxies.  HTTP/1.1 servers may send
    other Cache-Control directives that permit caching by HTTP/1.1
    proxies in addition to the Expires: old-date directive; the Cache-
    Control directive will override the Expires: old-date for HTTP/1.1
    proxies.
