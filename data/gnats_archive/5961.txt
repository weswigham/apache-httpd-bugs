>Description:
The documentation of NameVirtualHost
(see http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#namevirtual) should be revised.
The value of <addr> that follows the directive is not the "address to which 
your name-based virtual host names resolve".  Rather, it is the IP address of
the physical interface that will receive the requests.  This is important
when a web server handling the request is not the machine which owns the
virutal host name.

Consider the following.  A firewall located at 4.3.0.100 port forwards external 
port 80 traffic to internal server located at 192.168.0.100.
The virtual host to set up resolves it's IP address back to the firewall.
The documentation states that the correct form of the directive would be:
	NameVirtualHost 4.3.0.100
When it actually should be:
	NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.100
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The relevant portion of NameVirtualHost should be re-written to look like:
With the NameVirtualHost directive you specify the address to which your 
server is bound to (See the BindAddress directive).
