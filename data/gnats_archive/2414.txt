>Environment:
SunOS lambda 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m
>Description:
apachectl can't detect if apache is running or not, so it fails to restart or stop it.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The problem is that under 4.1.3_U1 the command 'ps' does not require
the switch -p; changing the line
        PS=`ps -p $PID 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep $PID`
to
        PS=`ps $PID 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep $PID`
in apachectl fixed the problem.

State-Changed-Why:
This has already been reported and will be tracked
in PR#2285.  We can not just change the call to ps because
more systems break doing it without a -p than do with a -p,
so we actually have to do something more complex.

Thanks for the report.
