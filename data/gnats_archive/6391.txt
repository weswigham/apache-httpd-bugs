Not important, both FreeBSD and WinNT
>Description:
I'm trying to allow file uploading by using HTTP form with method POST and CGI Perl script on server side. Server, not the script should do size restriction, as system can get out of memory before script gains control.
 
My configuration file:
        LimitRequestBody 300000
        ErrorDocument 413 /413.shtml

When uploaded file exceeds 300000 bytes, server instead of raising an error truncates the request body to limit and does exec corresponding CGI-script. 
Perl script with CGI module halts with "Malformed multipart POST".

When changing the value of limit, results are: 
below 10k - All ok, 413 error arises and is intercepted by ErrorDocument.
     100k - If file size >300 kb all correct, intercepted 413 error.
            If file size is 120 kb, script is called and dies.

Is this normal behavior or bug ?
Is it possible to raise error every time when limit is hit ?
>How-To-Repeat:

LimitRequestBody 100000 for some time.

 Re:
 It's better to use http://195.218.168.72:8080/upload/upload.html.
 Server mclean.rbc.ru may be not resolved by DNS.
