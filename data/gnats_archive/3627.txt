Not relevant
>Description:
The file docs/install/index.html contains a section:

"How do I add and execute my servlets now that Apache JServ is installed?

In that section is a link to the "JavaSoft Java Tutorial".  That link just
gets me to a "Oops, couldn't find your document" page on JavaSoft.  I'd
guess that your link needs updating.  Just thought you'd want to know.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the documentation pages in the distribution.
>Fix:
Fix the link or eliminate it.
