IRIX buit3 6.3 12161207 IP32
>Description:
On my system (Irix 6.3, reasonably current as far as patches go), Apache
doesn't restart when it receives a SIGHUP.  All of the child servers die,
but nothing comes back up.  The main server process continues to run, but
it doesn't respond to any incoming requests, nor does it log any errors
to the error_log.

 Try adding:
 
 EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 
 or 
 
 EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DUSE_USLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 
 to your src/Configuration file and recompiling.  Tell us how it goes,
 thanks.
