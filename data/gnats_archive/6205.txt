Operating System = Solaris ( and probably more )...
Compiler = Gcc 2.95 ( This is really a non factor )
SunOS falcon 5.7 Generic_106541-04 sun4u sparc
>Description:
I realize that Apache 2.04a is an alpha release, but I wanted to help
out just in case no one catches this before the final release.
On Solaris ( and other Unices I am sure ) there is no Bash shell ( by default ).
When you run the buildconf script to build your configure script,
it erroniously assumes that /bin/sh is bash.  Sadly, this is not
the case and the '==' comparison operators which are valid in Bash
are not valid in the Bourne shell.  As a result, the configure script
fails on syntax errors.
>How-To-Repeat:
To recreate the problem just run ./buildconf on Solaris from
the top level source directory, then run ./configure.  Unless
you have replace Solaris' /bin/sh with Bash, it will fail.
>Fix:
Change the '==' comparison operators generated by buildconf to '=',
which is valid syntax in both the Bourne shell and Bash.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: abagchi
State-Changed-When: Tue Jun 20 11:31:44 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
I believe the only occurance of this was removed just after
a4 was released.  If you know of any more instances of == in
the configure script, please report them.

Thank you for your bug report.
