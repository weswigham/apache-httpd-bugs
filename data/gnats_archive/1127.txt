>Description:

When my server starts up my main server's log files are owned by www:www
which is what the server runs as. (according to User and Group directives)

When the virtual servers write their logs they are owned by root:root.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start the server w/ at least one virtual server with an empy log directoy and
do an ls -l
>Fix:
This is only a guess, but it would  seem the logs are created by the server before
the setuid() call. (Or whatever the server does to do an effective su) If this were the case making the setuid call before the logs are created would fix this.

State-Changed-Why:
As I said in the newsgroup, the code creates all logfiles
as the user that Apache starts as.

Please show me the output of a "ls -ld logdir", where logdir
is the diretory your logfiles go in.

What user are you starting Apache as?  Not the one you
run it as, but the one you start it as.

As I said before, they should all be owned by the user
that starts Apache.  The problem is not how the virtual
host logs are being created but how the main server log
is being created.

 I am starting it as root -- since I need to run at port 80

 I have one major concern and a question about all of this ...
 My concern is the incosistency of the UID/GID ownership of 
 log files with some seeming to be root and others not. 
 My concern is the usual what is running as root, what does it do,
 what holes does it allow for. 
 
 The other question I have is how to allow for my customers to truncate
 their log files (if I charge for disk space, they should be able to 
 truncate their files, no?) 
 
 Cheers,
 
 Steve

 The documentation explicitly states that you should not do this.  Anyone
 who has write permission to the directory the logs are in can get
 root.  This has been discussed time and time again in the newsgroups
 and there is a big warning in the docs.
 
 There may be something odd going on with your system making the files
 owned by the owner of the directory.  Try changing to to something
 more sane, like root.wheel and see what user the log files are created
 as then.  Apache isn't doing anything to change who they are created
 as.

 The log files are opened before the process setuid()s.  This is
 by design; in most environments, it is not acceptable for people running 
 CGIs to be able to mess with the log files.

 You should not let them do anything with them directly.  If you
 want, run a script that rotates them out into another location
 every day and changes the permissions so your clients can play with
 them.  Or treat the log files as seperate, and don't bill them for
 them.
 
 If you must let users play with the log files directly, just have
 a cron job or something that changes the permissions on the files
 (_not_ the directory) so they can play with them.  Be warned that
 they will probably mess things up often.
 
 I'm not sure it is wise to have no reliable logs of what accesses their
 are to your client's sites, but that is a local issue.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache 1.2 will create logs with the group of the Group setting,
this is fixed in Apache 1.3 and won't be fixed in Apache 1.2.
A proper umask makes this irrelevant.

But logs are definately created with the user that apache is
invoked as.  So I cannot reproduce the problem, and I see no
code path that could cause this to happen.

Please provide a minimal config that shows the problem if you
are still having problems.
