found on solaris 2.6, but should be found on all UNIXs
>Description:
this is more a suggestion: You should search for perl, before searching for apxs, because if you don't have perl (yes! Some people still don't have perl <g>) configure will report 'could not find apxs' (eventhough you have apxs). That's a little confusing 
>How-To-Repeat:
run configure on a machine with no perl installed
>Fix:
check for perl first, then check for apxs
