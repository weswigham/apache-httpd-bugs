And when I tried to access protected document from client browser, I got an
error message saying "password mismatch".

State-Changed-Why:

When using 'add' the password you're supplying on the
command line is assumed to already be encrypted.  If you
want to supply a plaintext password and have dbmmanage
encrypt it, use 'adduser' instead.

This problem was with a vendor version (IBM HTTP Server)
in any event; please contact the vendor directly for
support.
