Hi
I am using apache 2.0.23.
I used the ./apxs tool to build and load mod_vs.c
I have a directive flag in the module called "VS" that needs to be set to On/Off in the config file. Even without me setting this directive VS in the config file the module-handler is being invoked. This way I am not able to enable/disable the module from the httpd config file.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a logic problem.

Your module needs to set a field in it's config structure
that determines if it is on or off.  Then, in the handler,
you should check that field.

Thank you for using Apache
