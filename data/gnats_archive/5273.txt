>Description:
I've compiled both apache 1.3.6, and Apache 1.3.9, on my machine, to use PHP-4.0B2 with it. Compiles clean, installs clean. When I run 'apachectl start', I get the following:

[Sun Nov 7  21:17:55 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (PHP4.0B2) configured -- resuming normal operations

Apache is exiting!
>How-To-Repeat:
recompile apache, witht he same setup, as above. glibc-2.1.2 as the main library, and recompile apache, using libc-5.4.46. Same error occurs, on both. egcs-1.1.2 or probably even gcc-2.7.2.3. Either, should give the same error.
>Fix:
initgroups() in http_main.c, line 3018, there is:
if (initgroups(name, ap_group_id) == -1) {
            ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ALERT, server_conf,
                        "initgroups: unable to set groups for User %s "
                        "and Group %u", name, (unsigned)ap_group_id);
            clean_child_exit(APEXIT_CHILDFATAL);
        }

initgroups(3) states:
The initgroups() function  initializes  the  group  access
       list  by  reading  the group database /etc/group and using
       all groups of which user  is  a  member.   The  additional
       group group is also added to the list.

The  initgroups()  function returns 0 on success, or -1 if
       an error occurs.

  on most linux boxes, 'nobody' has UID 65534. nogroup, has GID -2. httpd.conf asks to not use any group above 65536. las tI checked, -2 < 65536. So, why should initgroups return -1 in this instance? If true, no linux box, running glibc-2.1.2 will be able to compile and run apache 1.3.6 - 1.3.9. I would suggest checking initgroups() to see what may be happening, for this error to occur.

State-Changed-Why:
Please don't submit repeated PRs on the same thing.  I already
responded to your previous one asking you to set a valid
Group in your config file.  -2 is NOT less than 65536 when
-2 is an unsigned number.
