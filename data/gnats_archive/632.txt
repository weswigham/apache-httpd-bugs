>Description:
I have two scripts written in perl:
-rwxr--r--    1 mim      www        23794 May 15 12:33 filmy.cgi
-rwxr--r--    1 mim      www        18660 Mar 28 08:33 seanse.cgi
When I try the URL http://mim.man.poznan.pl/adm/kina/filmy.cgi
Netscape opens save as (MIME type application/x-httpd-cgi) dialog.
But when I enter URL http://mim.man.poznan.pl/adm/kina/seanse.cgi
everything is OK and the script is executed.
Apache 12b8 works fine with both scripts in the same httpd
configuration (httpd.conf) but the file Configuration may by not
the same.
>How-To-Repeat:
These scripts are password protected.
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
What happens in b11?

Try copying the scripts to a different location and seeing
if you still have the same problems.

Try temporarily replacing one of the scripts with the other;
this will tell you if it is the name of the script causing
the problem or the contents of the script.

Do you have any config directives that apply specifically to
each file?
