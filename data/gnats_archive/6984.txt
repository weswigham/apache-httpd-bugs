>Description:
when the line:
ServerTokens Prod
is in the config the server should just report "Apache" as server software.
but when it produces a err 404 it prints out more information:
Apache/1.3.14 Server at servername Port 80
haven't checked other errors.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Fri Dec 15 13:17:29 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:

ServerTokens is designed to control only the
HTTP response header field.  It would be a mistake
to overload it with more functions.
As you realized, the correct thing to change
is ServerSignature.
Thanks for using Apache!
