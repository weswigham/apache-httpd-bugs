>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.4 2 sun4m
>Description:
'apachectl stop' does not find the process identified in the httpd.run file 
because 'ps -p' does not work on SunOS 4.1.4:
> ps -p
> ps: p: unknown option
> ps: usage: ps [-acCegjklnrStuvwxU] [num] [kernel_name] [c_dump_file] [swap_file]
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
replace the line
        PS=`ps -p $PID 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep $PID`
by the lines
	OS=`uname -sr`
	if [ "$OS" = "SunOS 4.1.4" ]; then
	    PS=`ps $PID 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep $PID`
	else
	    PS=`ps -p $PID 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep $PID`
	fi
Then it will work for SunOS 4.1.4 also; i do not know how to just 
identifying SunOS 4 with sh (and how many non-4.1.4 may be still out there)

State-Changed-Why:
A fix has been committed and will be available in 1.3.1.
We decided to just not use ps at all to avoid all the
hassles, and to do what we have to a different way.

Thanks for the report.
