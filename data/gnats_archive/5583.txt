>Description:
AllowOverride within a <DirectoryMatch> or <Directory ~> directive
does not override any pervious setting made thru another <Directory> directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
<Directory />
  Options None
  AllowOverride None
  order deny,allow
  deny from all
</Directory>

<DirectoryMatch "/opt/.*/htdocs">
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride AuthConfig, Limit
  order allow,deny
  allow from all
</DirectoryMatch>

# If you try to access /opt/mydomain.com/htdocs/index.html
# it works perfect. (The order...allow settings within <Directory>
# gets overriden by those in <DirectoryMatch>).
# But it won't read /opt/mydomain.com/htdocs/.htaccess to see
# if any local settings are there (The AllowOverride in <Directory>
# doesn't get overriden by the one in <DirectoryMatch>).
#
# When the root AllowOverride specify some options, .htaccess gets read
# but it the server behaves like if the <DirectoryMatch>'s AllowOverride
# isn't there.
>Fix:
Workarround:
Use <Directory> when you have to override an AllowOverride. When you don't
have do to that, the others directives seem to work well.
