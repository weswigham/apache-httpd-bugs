        I recently encountered the same bug. You probably have already
        discovered a fix, but here's the one i found.
        When you ./configure, add --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE.
        The documentation trail is obscure, but the ./INSTALL file
        refers to ./htdocs/manual/dso.html, which dicusses to
        --enable-rule, but without identifying applicable platforms.

---
Add following to README.configure, near line 180:
	Some platforms require additional configuration to enable DSO.
	When starting the server, an error message may report:
	"... symbol ap_palloc: referenced sysbol not found ..."
	Reconfigure with "--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE" and rebuild.
	See details in htdocs/manual/dso.html.
