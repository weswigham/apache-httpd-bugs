>Environment:
I am using Apache 2.0.28 beta built on Nov 12 2001 running on Windows NT 4.0.
I download and install a binary apache_2_0_28-beta-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi from apache.org.
>Description:
I have installed Apache 2 on Windows NT 4.0
Then I configure httpd.conf this way

I uncommented the following lines
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/proxy_http.so

Then appended this lines at the end

ProxyPass         /cgi http://localhost/cgi-bin
ProxyPassReverse  /cgi http://localhost/cgi-bin

ProxyPass         /CGI/ http://localhost/cgi-bin/
ProxyPassReverse  /CGI/ http://localhost/cgi-bin/

Then I created this cgi script in perl in .../cgi-bin named Clock.pl

#!E:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -w
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

my $TOUT = 20;
$| = 1;
print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";

print <<"END_HTML";
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Richard's Clock</title>
    <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="$TOUT">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
      <span id='HH'>00</span>:<span id='MM'>00</span>:<span id='SS'>00</span>
    </h1>
    <script>
      document.HH = document.getElementById( 'HH' ).firstChild;
      document.MM = document.getElementById( 'MM' ).firstChild;
      document.SS = document.getElementById( 'SS' ).firstChild;
    </script>
END_HTML

for ( my $i = 0; $i < $TOUT; ++$i ) {
  my ( $SS, $MM, $HH ) = localtime();
  $SS =~ s/^(.)$/0$1/;
  $MM =~ s/^(.)$/0$1/;
  $HH =~ s/^(.)$/0$1/;
  print <<"END_HTML";
    <script>
      document.HH.nodeValue = '$HH';
      document.MM.nodeValue = '$MM';
      document.SS.nodeValue = '$SS';
    </script>
    <span>$SS</span>
END_HTML
  sleep( 1 );
}

print <<"END_HTML";
    <script>
      document.location = document.location;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
END_HTML

exit( 0 );

Then I point my browser to http://localhost/cgi-bin/Clock.pl and it works !!!
But when I point my browser to http://localhost/cgi/Clock.pl it doesn't work, I think that is because its trying to proxy to http://localhost/cgi-binn/Clock.pl instead of http://localhost/cgi-bin/Clock.pl !!!
But if I try pointing to http://localhost/CGI/Clock.pl it seema as it works, but then we discover another bug, because mod_proxy starts introducing garbage in the response to the browser.

The first bug doesn't happened in Apache 1.3.x.

State-Changed-Why:
I cannot recreate this error with the latest CVS. Please retry with 2.0.32 (at least) to see if the error still exists for you. There have been changes in the proxy code since .28.
