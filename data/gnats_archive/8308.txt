Tru64 4.0F patch 5
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
We recently upgraded from Apache/1.3.6 to Apache/1.3.20 and notice that we can 
no longer use the "UseCanonicalName" directive in .htaccess files.  From PR #5970
(as well as the docs) we are aware that "AllowOverride Options" ought to enable the
use of that directive, that doesn't appear to work, as we have "AllowOverride All"
set.

A virtual host entry for a site where we've seen this problem looks like:
**************************************************************
Listen 64.82.21.202:80
<VirtualHost 64.82.21.202>
ServerName      www.dhs-seminars.com
ServerAdmin     webmaster@dhs-seminars.com
DocumentRoot    /web/u263/www35737/www
SetEnv PHP_DOCUMENT_ROOT /web/u263/www35737/www
User www35737
Group users
RLimitCPU 300 600
Alias /stats /stats/263/www35737
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/u263/www35737/cgi-bin/
<Directory /web/u263/www35737>
AllowOverride All
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
************************************************************

and the /web/u263/www35737/www/.htaccess file looks like:

************************************************************
# -FrontPage-
    
IndexIgnore .htaccess */.??* *~ *# */HEADER* */README* */_vti*
        
<Limit GET POST>
order deny,allow

allow from all
</Limit>
<Limit POST PUT DELETE>
order deny,allow

</Limit>
AuthName www.dhs-seminars.com
AuthUserFile  /web/u263/www35737/www/_vti_pvt/service.pwd
AuthGroupFile /web/u263/www35737/www/_vti_pvt/service.grp  
UseCanonicalName On
*************************************************************

And the error message we get looks like:

*************************************************************
[Fri Sep  7 09:23:28 2001] [alert] [client 199.174.117.22] /web/u263/www35737/www/.htaccess: UseCanonicalName not allowed here
*************************************************************

Does UseCanonicalName work in .htaccess files for you?  We're going to investigate 
further, but we wanted to know if it was something peculiar to our setup or a
general problem.

Thanks,

 Aha, found it.  There appears to be an error in http_core.c.  The
 following change fixed it so that it behaves as documented:
 
 diff http_core.c.orig http_core.c 
 3104c3104
 <   RSRC_CONF|ACCESS_CONF, TAKE1,
 ---
 >   OR_OPTIONS, TAKE1,
 
 This may not be the optimal fix, looking at an old post from
 http://www.humanfactor.com/cgi-bin/cgi-delegate/apache-ML/nh/1998/Dec/0286.html
 which describes the change made in apache 1.3.4, it would seem to be
 correct, but there have been several changes to UseCanonicalName
 mentioned in CHANGES_1.3 since then, I don't know really what all they
 were supposed to do.  What I did seems to correctly do what we need
 however.
