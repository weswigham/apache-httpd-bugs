>Description:
Having set up the server following all of the settings for Extremely busy
FreeBSD servers, and compiling with the suggestions on the FIN_WAIT_2 problem,
I am still experiencing CGI scripts failing within SECONDS of restarting the
Web Server, The error is the same, "Internal Misconfiguration, please contact 
webmaster" error that would occur if something was wrong in the script. However,
If I HUP the web server, the scripts will work properly for about 15 Secs, then
the error will reappear.

State-Changed-Why:
Are these Perl scripts?  If so, make sure that they
have disabled buffering on stdout with "$| = 1" somewhere
before the first print statement.  If not, in what
language are they written?

 Have you resolved this yet?
 
 If not, note that the default processes per user limits under FreeBSD are
 probably too small and need to be increased.  If you have lots of virtual
 domains and are logging each to a seperate log file, you could be running
 out of file descriptors.
