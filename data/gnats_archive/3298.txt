>Description:
setting "options debug" in /etc/resolv.conf causes a bad header to be set, 
which in turn causes a 500 error at the end of some CGI scripts, after the script 
has performed its function(s).

this is the error that pops up on screen and in the error log:
malformed header from script. Bad header=;; res_setoptions(" de: /htdocs/interweb/cgi-bin/email


this was checked with both Apache 1.3.1 and 1.3.3
>How-To-Repeat:
using any instance of Matt's FormMail (v1.6) CGI produces this output.  my version is
up at http://beta.iweb.net/apps/form.html and http://beta.iweb.net/cgi-bin/email,
but obviously can't be used since this is on our production server.

>Fix:
since i haven't delved into the code, not yet.

State-Changed-Why:

Why do you think this is an Apache problem?  The error
message clearly states that the bogus information is
being emitted by the script, so it's the script that's
being affected by the resolver option, not the server.
Try running your script from the command line and see what
output it produces.

 Just because it appears one way on the command line doesn't mean it
 appears the same way on the server.  It is pretty clear that, for whatever
 reason, the debug output is getting sent out before the headers are
 complete.  That is not something Apache can or should work around.
 
 What is the exact output of running "scriptname | cat" from the
 commandline?

 thanks for the help,
