Problem occurs with all recent releases of Apache Win32 (1.3.4 onwards)
>Description:
When trying to create an Alias to a NT shared drive...

(e.g.  Net Use f: \\webserver\files")

Alias /files/ "f:/"

...Apache will not allow for access to the Alias area.

Should this be posssible, or is it a bug, or am I doing something wrong?

Any help would be appreciated.

Well, since you do nothing to say exactly what "won't
allow access" means, there isn't too much we can help you
with.

Ensure that, if you are running it as a service, you set it
up to run as a particular user with permission to access
network drives.
