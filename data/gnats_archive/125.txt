>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.1.6R
gcc 2.6.3 "bundled"
gcc 2.7.2.1
NetScape 3 or > and Adobe PDF plugin
>Description:
Netscape users with the "in-line" pdf viewer plugin is installed cannot 
view .pdf files served from my system if their size is > ~20K...the result is 
that they will not see the document (althought the pdf viewer will be spawned) 
and the server will record a "send lost connection to" error message in the log.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.uky.edu/~soward/test/table7.pdf is 67K and will not work
http://www.uky.edu/~soward/test/table4.pdf is 4K and will work just fine.
>Fix:
Not yet....1.2b4 under HPUX 10.2 does not exhibt this problem. I beleive it to 
be a result of some sort of TCP timeout which occurs while Netscape spawns the pdf
viewer...OmniWeb and OmniPDF, for example will work file -- but OmniWeb downloads 
the file to a tmp directory then runs OmniPDF on that file..."saving" the .pdf's 
from Netscape and then viewing works okay..

State-Changed-Why:
The error message you are getting from the server means that
it is getting a SIGPIPE sending data.  This happens when 
it get an error writing to the client.  This appears to be
a problem with the client, however it is odd that it should
happen differently with HPUX and FreeBSD.  I don't have
any Windows clients around here, so I can't do any testing
at the moment.  Please let us know if you find out anything
more.

State-Changed-Why:
Should be fixed in revision 1.98 of http_protocol.c.  It
is a problem with Netscape not supporting the standards.
The patch is available at
"http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/apply_to_1.2b6/",
please let me know if it fixes the problem for you.

State-Changed-Why:
No response from submitter as to if the change in 1.2b7
fixed their problem; assuming it did, since it fixed it 
for others.
