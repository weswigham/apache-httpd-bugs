State-Changed-Why:

You're probably not getting any error messages because
you have your LogLevel set to critical -- which means
only critical OR WORSE errors will be logged.  Try setting
it to 'notice' to see if the authentication process
shows anything meaningful.  Also, try spelling out
the complete path in your AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile
directives, rather than using relative paths.  Let
us know the results.

 That did it.  The log pointed out that my permissions on my group and
 password files were not correct.  The relative paths to the conf/passwd
 and conf/group files work perfectly.
 
 95% of your work must be configuration related.  I try not to be that
 majority.
 
 Amazing response time, thanks.

User confirms LogLevel was set too high, concealing the
permission error message.

 You need to specify the full path for the password files, if I recall
 correctly.
 
 And beware, that, even if things go wrong, you will not see anything in
 the logs as you have set the log level too high. Set it to info or at
 least to warning to see what is cooking.
