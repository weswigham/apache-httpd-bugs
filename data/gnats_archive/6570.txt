>Environment:
Linux ripley 2.2.17 #7 Sun Sep 17 14:24:18 CEST 2000 i686 unknown
>Description:
There is an error in ${DocumentRoot}/index.html.cz
The meta tag with charset must be
<META HTTP-Equiv="Content-Type" Content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-2">

In 1.3.12 distribution is this wrong meta tag:
<META NAME="ContentType" CONTENT="text/html; charset=iso-8859-2">

Codepage decoding tools used in the Czech Republic then work wrong on this page
- they don't recognize the charset and conversion fails
>How-To-Repeat:
No need to repeat - it is just an error in meta tag.
>Fix:
change the line
<META NAME="ContentType" CONTENT="text/html; charset=iso-8859-2">
to the correct one:
<META HTTP-Equiv="Content-Type" Content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-2">
