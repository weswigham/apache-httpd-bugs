Source error: 
=============
 Charset 'iso8859-1' is hardcoded in http_protocol.c (line N 2588)
 in the block which sends HTTP-header to a client in case of redirect.

 Thus - for each redirect - server sends HTTP-header with phrase:
  'Content-type="text/html; charset=iso8859-1"'.
 Server does it independently of 'AddDefaultCharset Off / On / charset' setting
 in the httpd.conf.
 Client's encoding is damaged because of this behaviour.

 Perhaps all will be OK if the second server (to which redirection is
  performed) sends HTTP-header with phrase:
  'Content-type="text/html; charset=...<proper value>"'.
 
 In practice, it isn't allways configured so.
>How-To-Repeat:
Of course you will see this problem only if you have second server with
content's charset not equal to 'iso8859-1'.
1. Configure second server: 'Do not send "charset=..." in HTTP-header'
2. Create HTML-file /xxx.html without meta-tag '...charset=...'
3. Configure Apache1.3.12: place redirect to http://second-server/xxx.html
    into httpd.conf
4. Configure client's browser to view http://second-server/xxx.html properly.
5. Try to view it through redirection.

==> Apache1.3.12 sends charset=iso8859-1 in HTTP-header while redirection
==> Browser sets it's encoding to "iso8859-1"
==> Second server doesn't send any charset-information
==> File http://second-server/xxx.html is viewed unproperly via redirection
==> After it, all other resources from http://second-server/ is viewed unproperly
>Fix:
Yes, and VERY simple way:
 - remove hardcoded charset from http_protocol.c
 For example, line 2588 will be:
  r->content_type = NULL;

After it, server sends phrase 'Content-type: text/plain' or similar
WITHOUT mentioning of 'charset'.
