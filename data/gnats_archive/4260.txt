>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, gcc
>Description:
1. ./configure  --enable-suexec  --suexec-caller=wwwsrvr  --suexec-userdir=public_html 
2. make
gives error:
gcc:  suexec.c: No such file or directory
Lines output before the error show there is a backslash in fron of suexec.c filename:
gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=260 \
                -DHTTPD_USER=\"wwwsrvr\" \
                -DUID_MIN=100 \
                -DGID_MIN=100 \
                -DUSERDIR_SUFFIX=\"public_html\" \
                -DLOG_EXEC=\"/usr/local/apache/logs/suexec_log\" \
                -DDOC_ROOT=\"/usr/local/apache/htdocs\" \
                -DSAFE_PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\" \ suexec.c
                this backslash:------------------------------^
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Yes, join lines in Makefile.tmp (avoid 2 backslashes), config, make again. ok.
