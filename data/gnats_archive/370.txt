 What do you mean "modified path"?  Who is modifying it?  The path should
 be that in effect when the server was started, or some default path if
 there was none.  Generally root's path is reasonably restrictive; if you
 wish to modify it you should be able to use SetEnv or change the path
 before you start httpd.

 That is my problem.. I unset the path with UnSetEnv and redefine
 it with SetEnv, but the $PATH inherited by the server from root (I am
 using /bin/sh5 as its shell) is the one passed to the CGI environment.

State-Changed-Why:
It doesn't look like we will be able to fix this for 1.2.  The
PATH variable is always inherited from the invoking process.
For best results you should start your httpd with something
like this:

/usr/bin/env - \
        LOGNAME="www" \
        USER="$LOGNAME" \
        PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin" \
        HOME="$dir" \
        BLOCKSIZE=1024 \
        NAME="Arctic Web Account" \
        ORGANIZATION="Arctic Gaming" \
        SHELL="/bin/sh" \
        $dir/bin/httpd -d $dir < /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &

 Hi,
 
 You got me thinking and have come up a suggestion. What if the path is
 defined internally to a sensible default (say, $APACHE_DIR/bin:/bin),
 the parent process path is ignored and internally assigned?
 
 Like this:
 
 $PATH="blah:blah" # Insecure, comes from root env, ignored.
 $HT_CGI_PATH="blah:blah" # Has a sensible default, can be redefined in srm.conf
 $PATH=$APACHE_PATH # Internally the server assigns $HT_CGI_PATH to $PATH.
 
 I guess this would close several possible backdoors.
 
 BTW, I am using the disallow ID module to disable any process spawning
 owned by root or a system user/group, it is not as safe as suexec I
 guess but it works for me.
