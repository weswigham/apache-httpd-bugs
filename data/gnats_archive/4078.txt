>Description:
We have put together a small patch to enable suexec to work anywhere in the 
document root.  It works by specifying a default CGIUser and CGIGroup 
for the document root (these are the only directive changes, I promise).
With FileInfo and EXECCGI enabled for the document root, users can then create
a cgi bin simply by putting the following in an htaccess file...
CGIUser "userid"
CGIGroup "group"
defaultType application/x-httpd-cgi

The execution is still subject to all of suexec's paranoia checks and the only 
things that are changed are in mod_cgi.c and util_script.c.  The patch 
can be found at 
http://www.louisville.edu/~khhaga01/apache.patch
Just in case it is anything of interest.  The changes to util_script.c were
simply the best way I could think to do it at the time.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm afraid this change would violate the suexec design
parameter that only the Apache admin can define valid
users for suexecution.  The FileInfo override class is
much too broad to allow arbitrary setting of execution
UIDs.

Closing this is an arbitrary decision on my part, based on
my personal opinion.  If you'd like to lobby for the change,
please join the new-httpd mailing list (see dev.apache.org
and look for "mail") and present its merits; if the group
concurs that it's a good thing, we can add it.  Thanks
for the suggestion in the meantime, and for using Apache!
