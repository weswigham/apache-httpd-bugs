>Description:
We run two virtual hosts with our apache. (one on port 80 and one on port 81)
The one with port 80 is for internal use.
The one with port 81 is for external use only (mapped from port 80 with
a firewall)

Internal users should use the servlets http://ourhost/servlet/aaa?...
Extern users should use the servlets http://ourhost/servlet/aaaext?...

So i must deny for the virtual host with port 81 do deny the access to
the servlet "aaa?...".

All of my trys with Location, Files, FilesMatch, Rewrite does not work!

While debugging the RewriteRules is see that the URI "servlet" never
come to the mod_rewrite !

What shall i do?

Thanks in advance!

>Fix:
Pass URI thrue access controls BEFORE into the servlet module?
