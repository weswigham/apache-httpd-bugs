State-Changed-Why:

Thanks for your feedback.  However, most of these
documents are simply there for historical reasons
and are not currently linked into the documentation.
They will be removed in the docs for Apache 2.0.
The last link you mentioned was broken but was
recently fixed and will be updated in the next release.

Anyway, thanks for reminding me to get rid of those
docs in the next version of Apache.
