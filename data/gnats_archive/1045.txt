Note: Linux/Alpha

Compiler:
gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
I could not compile httpd from a clean source tree on my machine, because it
complains about this:

http_main.c: In function `setup_shared_mem':
http_main.c:735: `SHM_R' undeclared (first use this function)
http_main.c:735: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
http_main.c:735: for each function it appears in.)
http_main.c:735: `SHM_W' undeclared (first use this function)
http_main.c: In function `child_main':

I know it is complaining about SHM_R not being defined. I looked and found
that SHM_R is defined in linux/shm.h not sys/shm.h on my system. So I added

#include <linux/shm.h>

at line 89 in http_main.c

It now will compile, but it warns:

/usr/include/sys/shm.h:35 warning: 'SHMLBA' redefined

httpd seems to work just fine so far, but I though you might want to know
about it....???

Should I be doing something different to fix the problem?

 You have a glibc based system, and the glibc folks messed up.  You can
 probably fix it with an upgrade of your libc package.
