>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
I use the binairy 1.3.20 version of apache for windows. I use windows 2000 SP 2 on a P-III 800, with 384 MB RAM. And use a ALCATE: speedtouch modem for connection with the internet, and a a DHCP and DNS server.
So I don't compile it myself. Just use your compilation.
>Description:
The server does not work at startup of the system. The service says it is started but does not work. The browser will never show a thing and keeps giving a request. 
A restart request will end op in with message "an error occured". 
Only a start and a stop request will have the server back online.
It behaves the same at my or a default configuration.


This is my Error Log file:

>How-To-Repeat:
I use an ADSL modem with a VPN connection to my privider (PPTP). When i delete the TCP/IP protocol from my network settings. And then restart and reinstall them. Everything will work for the next restart. After that the problem get back.
>Fix:
I thought it had something to do with the VPN connnection sind there is a FAQ concerning a similar kind of problem with 3de party VPN connection driver. But on my other computer (a laptop) With the same programs installed on a fresh windows 2000 sp2 installation. Has no problems at all.
I also found something about a patch on:
http://www.humanfactor.com/cgi-bin/cgi-delegate/apache-ML/nh/1999/Jun/0261.html
This was a old message but seems to have the same effect.
