>Environment:
Binary distribution of 1.3b3 for OS/2 from Apache
web site.

I'm currently running OS/2 Warp 4.0 Client with no
fixpaks installed.  Full LAN support is installed.
>Description:
This occurs only once out of every few (4-5) startups.
When I kill the server and restart it quickly (in a
command file), the server sometimes fails to start 
properly.  Before being accessed, the number of httpd
processes quickly drops to one.  If a port 80 request
is made by a browser, that process dies.

This appears to be new in the 1.3b3 beta.  It didn't 
appear in the 1.2.4 release from Softlink.

BTW:  1.3b3 seems to be a lot snappier than 1.2.4
>How-To-Repeat:
I terminate the running process using the terminate.cmd
file provided in the Softlink distribution.  The new
process is started with a 'detach httpd'.

Basically, you run it and watch the process list.
If it drops to a single process in ten seconds or
so, it failed.  If the processes remain, you're ok.

The exact command script is as follows:
/* BEGIN HTTPD COMMAND SCRIPT */
/* */
CALL RxFuncAdd 'SysLoadFuncs', 'RexxUtil', 'SysLoadFuncs'
CALL RxFuncAdd 'SysCurPos', 'RexxUtil', 'SysCurPos'
CALL RxFuncAdd 'SysCls', 'RexxUtil', 'SysCls'
CALL SysLoadFuncs

'c:'
'cd \os2httpd'
hostfile = 'hostname';

'hostname >' hostfile
hostname = LINEIN(hostfile)
CALL STREAM hostfile 'c' 'close'
say 'HOSTNAME =' hostname
'set HOSTNAME='hostname

'cd os2'
'call terminate.cmd'
'cd ..'

'detach httpd.exe'
/* END HTTPD COMMAND SCRIPT */

If I can provide more informatin let me know.

 It would seem that the problem occurs when the new server starts up before
 the original server has finished shutting down. The new server can't open
 port 80 if the old server hasn't closed it yet so it terminates with an
 error.
 
 Ideally, you need to wait for the old process to die before starting the new
 one but a delay of a few seconds should be enough to make the script work as
 intended (EG "call SysSleep 5")
 
 Also, there's a bug in 1.3 beta 3 (now fixed) that caused shutdown to take an
 unnecessarily long time which would have increase the chances of this
 happening.

 Brian,
 
 Thanks much for the info (very prompt).  I implemented a delay.  Five 
 seconds didn't always do it, but ten seconds appears to do the job (idle 
 P150).

State-Changed-Why:
User fixed it by increasing their delay... probably also will
be helped in 1.3b4 by Brian Havard's patch.
