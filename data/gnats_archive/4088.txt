>Organization:
>Environment:
NT 4.0 (sp4)
>Description:
make.java.bat and make.c.bat (I am guessing at the names because I no longer 
have the files) fail because of spaces in path names. When I corrected this 
in the java bat, it ran but then screwed up the Apache server path names in the
registry so that I could no longer start the Apache server as a Windows NT
service (I had to put quotes around all the Apache pathnames).  

My Apache server is installed using all the installation defaults. 
>How-To-Repeat:
You don't want to.
>Fix:
Make the installation software robust. Most people (like me) don't know much
about the product at installation time.

I look forward to the end of this beta. I would like to use this but right now
its too difficult (and time-consuming) to install.

 The installation software is fairly robust, I'm not sure why you are trying
 to use those files since they are really only for development.
