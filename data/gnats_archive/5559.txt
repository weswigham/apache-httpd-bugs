When we're trying to access some (.so) modules we're getting such segfault.
Anything was okay on FreeBSD-2.2-STABLE with the same modules. However, some modules return segfault and
some do not. I suppose this to be problem of Apache working with ELF binaries.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.silver-lynx.com/gtl/list - module will generate segfault.
I can provide sources and makefiles for modules in a personal touch.
Free for contacts on this topic.
>Fix:
No ideas. My 'list' module wouldn't return segfault if there will be no functions inside;
segfault beeing generated even when on try to run simple function (like,
void zzz(void) { return; })
