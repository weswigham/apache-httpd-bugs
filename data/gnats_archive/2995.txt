State-Changed-Why:
Can you give us a bit more information?
How did you attempt to start Apache? (as a service? command 
line? use any command line options?) 
Is Apache installed as a service?

If you install Apache but do not install it as a service,
then attempt a command line start without specifying the 
-f option, Apache looks for conf/httpd.conf in the default 
install directory, /apache. I suspect this is your problem.
