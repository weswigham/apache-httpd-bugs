Does the error log say anything?

Is anything output when you start it?

 Hi, just did some more playing with it and finally figured it out
 
 It seems it wants a logs subdirectory under ServerRoot, regardless of what
 path is specified for logs.  It seems it needs to create temp files, but
 would it not be better then to have it create these files directly in
 serverroot rather then relying on /logs to exist?
