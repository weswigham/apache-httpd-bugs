>Description:
I am aware that Apache may be adding the ERROR_NOTES information to the default
ErrorDocument, however is it possible to add a way to include this information in
the customized error document?
>How-To-Repeat:
N/a
>Fix:
ErrorDocument 500 500.html
Then include something like, <!--ERROR_NOTES-->, in the 500.html at the
location you would like this information added.

This is already available through

    <!--#echo var="REDIRECT_ERROR_NOTES" -->

if your error document is marked as server-parsed.
Thanks for using Apache!
