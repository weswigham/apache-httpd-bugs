FreeBSD 2.2.2-RELEASE #0
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
If you access other services via TCP/IP from within an CGI-BIN and the
other service calls identd, identd reports "root" instead of the logname
of the uid apache is running with.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Easy, add a
    setlogin((getpwuid(user_id))->pw_name);
in src/http_main.c before calling setuid(user_id)
This is around line 1699 in apache-1.2.4.
Don't know whether this is also need in the MPE code.

This problem probably also applies to the suexec.c program

State-Changed-Why:
This would be nice, but isn't setlogin() a BSD4.4ism?  I don't
see it on my linux or solaris boxes.  Doing this portably is a
pain in the butt if setlogin() does what I think it does ...
that is, it mucks with utmp right?

If so, why the heck is identd even bothering with utmp?

State-Changed-When: Thu Nov 13 09:07:39 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly not going to be changed for
1.3, since the setlogin() routine isn't available on
all platforms.  However, I'm marking this as suspended
so it can be revisited later.

Thanks for the report, and for using Apache!

 boy, that was criminally unclear.  what i meant was, if `foo' su's to
 root *and starts httpd*, CGIs run by suexec will get `foo' from
 getlogin.  sorry.

 i couldn't figure out how to *add* to an existing PR, so maybe
 somebody can just paste this into 1191 for me. :-)
 
 another context in which the setlogin problem occurs is this.
 fastmail calls getlogin to determine the default envelope sender of
 mail that it sends.  in our environment, which is suexec under apache
 1.2 on BSDI 3.1, if user `foo' su's (not su -'s) to root, fastmail
 when run by a CGI will get `foo' from getlogin.  this is clearly
 wrong; getlogin should return the name of the user that the CGI is
 running as.
 
 note that BSDI's getlogin does not operate via any of the numerous
 hacks available, but by storing a string in a per-session data
 structure (i'm assuming).  i infer this from the fact that i can
 setlogin to a nonexistent username.
 
 problems:
 
 1) httpd should setlogin to the name of the user, because it makes a
 guarantee to run as a particular user.
 
 2) *especially*, suexec should setlogin to the name of the user owning
 the CGI, because it absolutely should not permit any uncontrolled
 aspects of the environment to leak through.
 
 the PR comments:
 
 > This is almost certainly not going to be changed for 1.3, since the
 > setlogin() routine isn't available on all platforms.
 
 i think this is ill-advised.  on the platforms where setlogin is
 available, it defines an aspect of the environment that should be
 controlled.
