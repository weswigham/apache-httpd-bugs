Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html. If you don't
wish to do the port yourself, please submit this output rather
than the patches. Thank you.

Pressing on with the build process, but all bets are off.
Do not be surprised if it fails. If it works, and even
if it does not, please contact the above address.

** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration

 Aborting!

Yes, there is a simple soloution.
In the Configure utility you are doing a case function and checking for various OS. However I have noticed that you are looking for the following pattern for HP-UX machines : *-hp-hpux10.* . But this pattern will not find HP-UX patterns because they are in the format of : hp9000_800-hpux10.20 .
The following change to the Configure script fixed the problem. Instead of : *-hp-hpux10.*  I wrote : hp*-hpux10.* . Now everything works fine.
