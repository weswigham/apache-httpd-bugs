>Description:
The following construct is not properly handled by mod_include.c

 <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/random/random/debug.cnf"-->

Specifically, the program /cgi-bin/random is a perl script which
expects $ENV{PATH_TRANSLATED} to be set to "/some/directory/random/debug.cnf"
which is not occuring. This same behavior was observed in the NCSA
server(s), for which we posted the patch

ftp://www.destek.net/pub/ncsa-ssi.diff

several months ago. This seems to be a general problem in that the
Apache code doesn't appear to permit arguments in a SSI command in the
same fashion as they would be if the URL were requested directly.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.destek.net/Doc/CGI/random/ provides samples of the

Analyze the referenced diff for the NCSA code and find a mechanism
to handle requests in a similar manner, if this is the same bug..

 I think we recommend the use of <!--#include
 virtual="/cgi-bin/random/random/debug.cnf" --> in this case... can you
 give it a try?
 
 Thanks

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sat Apr 19 15:04:47 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
#exec cgi is intended to pass the parameters of the "main" request.
So the PATH_TRANSLATED and such will be those of the .html file.
#include virtual is more appropriate for this and should work.

Thanks for using Apache.
