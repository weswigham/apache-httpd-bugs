>Description:
We have virtual hosts that serve content to audiences in specific areas of
the U.S. We'd like the ability to set TZ appropriately for each VirtualHost.
However, apache adds the TZ environment variable w/o checked to see if it
has already been set via mod_env. I propose the following patch to util_script.c:

*** util_script.c.orig  Fri Feb 27 22:31:50 1998
--- util_script.c       Fri Feb 27 22:32:44 1998
***************
*** 151,159 ****
      char *whack;
  
      j = 0;
!     tz = getenv("TZ");
!     if (tz != NULL)
!       env[j++] = pstrcat(p, "TZ=", tz, NULL);
      for (i = 0; i < env_arr->nelts; ++i) {
        if (!elts[i].key)
            continue;
--- 151,161 ----
      char *whack;
  
      j = 0;
!     if (!table_get(t, "TZ")) {
!       tz = getenv("TZ");
!       if (tz != NULL)
!           env[j++] = pstrcat(p, "TZ=", tz, NULL);
!     }
      for (i = 0; i < env_arr->nelts; ++i) {
        if (!elts[i].key)
            continue;

This would allow us to override the TZ environment variable in the child
environment.
