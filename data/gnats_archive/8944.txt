Microsoft VC++ 6.0 SR5
>Description:
My ISAPI extension makes use of the CHttpServerContext::ServerSupportFunction to redirect clients. When this method is called with the HSE_REQ_SEND_URL_REDIRECT_RESP flag, a status code of 200 with a "Location: .." header is sent.  The client sees the 200 status and thinks its work is done, displaying a blank page.  If the correct status code of 302 were sent, the client would redirect to the target URL and not display the blank page.

FYI, if I use the HSE_REQ_SEND_URL flag instead of the HSE_REQ_SEND_URL_REDIRECT_RESP flag, my client correctly loads the target page. This is because Apache has fetched the target page and simply respondeds with it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a simple ISA that uses the ServerSupportFunction with the HSE_REQ_SEND_URL_REDIRECT_RESP flag.  Then simply invoke the functionality.
>Fix:
The ServerSupportFunction with the HSE_REQ_SEND_URL_REDIRECT_RESP flag should always return a 302 status code, as per the MSDN documentation.
