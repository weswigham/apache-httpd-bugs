>Release:        2.0.28
>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux for z/Series (64-bit IBM S/390)
>Description:
When sending the headers during a sendfile request, the Linux code for apr_sendfile() within sendrecv.c calls apr_sendv() to send the headers. It passes the address of the variable hdrbytes (defined as apr_int32_t) to the routine which is expecting apr_size_t. On a 32-bit system this works fine, but results in the value 0 (the top 32 bits of the 64 bit variable specifying the actual length of the data sent) being referenced when the variable hdrbytes is interrogating further on in the code. Changing this variable to apr_size_t fixes the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
This problem should occur on any 64-bit Linux system. A simple HTML which includes <SCRIPT> directives that cause javascript files to be downloaded will do the trick. 
>Fix:
