uname -a: OpenBSD googol 2.9 GENERIC#653 i386

>Description:
on line 727 of httpd.conf it states:
<QUOTE>
#ErrorDocument 500 "The server made a boo boo.
</QUOTE>

The trailing " is missing.  On the next line it indicates there should be more than one:
<QUOTE>
#  n.b.  the (") marks it as text, it does not get output
</QUOTE>
>How-To-Repeat:
less /var/www/conf/httpd.conf  # the actual path depends on the installation
/boo                           # do a search for "boo"

there you are
>Fix:
put a quote on the end of the line

State-Changed-Why:

In fact, that is not a typo.  ErrorDocument has a wacky
syntax in 1.3 where the LEADING quote indicates that
the rest of the line is an error message.  The
trailing quote should not be present.  This has been
cleaned up in 2.0.

Thanks for using Apache!
