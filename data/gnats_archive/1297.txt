>Description:
I have been trying to get digest auth to work. So far, I have tried Netscape Navigator 4.03 (which specifically says it supports MD5
encryption in the 'about' page) and Explorer 3.01a for the Mac.

When using Navigator, I get a '401: Forbidden' at the client and this message in the error log:

  [Date/time] access to /admin failed for <IP address>, reason: client used wrong authentication scheme

When using Explorer, I get only the Forbidden and no log message.

So the question is: what browsers has this feature been verified to work with? Does this sound
like user error on my part?
>How-To-Repeat:
In this case, the .htdigest file (containing the encrypted password created by the htdigest utility)
is stored in the same folder as the .htaccess file itself. All files starting with .ht* are
protected using the <Files> segment of the .htaccess:

Contents of .htaccess

AuthType Digest
AuthName Realm
AuthDigestFile <path to .htdigest file>
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
<limit GET POST>
        order deny,allow
        deny from all
        allow from <first two octets of my domain>
        require valid-user
</limit>
<Files .ht*>
        <limit GET POST>
                order deny,allow
                deny from all
                allow from none
        </limit>
</files>

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug report, but a configuration
question; mostly not really related to Apache.  Please
do not submit problem reports for such things.

I am not aware of any mainstream clients that support it.

The docs say:
   MD5 authentication provides a more secure password system, but only
   works with supporting browsers. As of this writing (July 1996), the
   majority of browsers do not support digest authentication. Therefore,
   we do not recommend using this feature on a large Internet site.
   However, for personal and intra-net use, where browser users can be
   controlled, it is ideal.

Unfortunately, browser vendors haven't yet woken up to the
need for an auth method stronger than basic but not as
painful as SSL client certificates.
