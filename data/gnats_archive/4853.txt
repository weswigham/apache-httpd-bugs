>Description:
During configure, I got this message:

** WARNING: We have no explicit knowledge about shared object
** support for your particular platform. But perhaps you have
** luck: We were able to guess the compiler and linker flags
** for creating shared objects from your Perl installation.
** If they actually work, please send the following information
** for inclusion into later releases to new-httpd@apache.org or make
** a suggestion report at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html:
**     PLATFORM=i386-whatever-freebsd4.0
**     CFLAGS_SHLIB=-DPIC -fpic
**     LDFLAGS_SHLIB=-shared
**     LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT= 

It does in fact work well.  I had to add --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE, as well.
Here is my config.status:

CC="cc" \
CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -Wall" \
./configure \
"--with-layout=Apache" \
"--enable-shared=max" \
"--enable-module=all" \
"--enable-suexec" \
"--suexec-caller=http" \
"--with-perl=/usr/bin/perl" \
"--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE" \
"$@"
