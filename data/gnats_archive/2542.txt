>Environment:
SunOS 5.4 generic sun4c sparc, 32 Mega Bytes of RAM - plenty of Hard Drive space
etc.
>Description:
Images will not load, have tried six different browsers and versions - same
problem.  Change of the file name will allow it to fully load.  I've tried
several times to get it to work with no avail.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sometimes it'll happen, sometimes it wont, but here's a URL:
http://beep.abetterbeep.com:81/
If images won't show up - there it is, HTML is fine on that page.
Or,
http://beep.abetterbeep.com:81/newinterface/
>Fix:
As I'm no C Programmer, I do think that there is something going on with
either image processing (as in identification for content-types) or perhaps
some module installed that's screwing it up (I did a base install with
no modules)

Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:

I went to the referenced Web page, and had no problem
whatsoever - the images appeared just fine.

Please examine your access_log and error_log for references
to the images in a request for which they didn't load,
and see if there are any messages or if the request status
in the access_log is anything except 200.

 This is almost certainly a problem with Solaris.
 
 Do you have the latest patch cluster from Sun installed?  If not, install
 it.
