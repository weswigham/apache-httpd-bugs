gcc -2.7.2.1
>Description:
The <Files> option does not indent itself (like <Directory> and <Location>) When using an <Files> and looking at the resuling info seems to indicate that options given in the <FILES> section are global.
>How-To-Repeat:
add this to access.conf:
    <files /home/middelin/Web/prive.html>
    deny from all
    allow from .polyware.iaf.nl
    </files>
and look at the output of the info handler
>Fix:
The solution is quite simple:

in mod_info.c around line 162 and further: add some strncasecmp's for <files>
