>Description:
I have a file called foo.html and if MultiViews are specified I can access
the file as http://myhost/foo.html and http://myhost/foo

If I try to access it as http://myhost/foo/bar then I get a message in
the error log saying "access to /(full_path)/foo.html failed for (myhost),
reason: File does not exist", but the file does exist !

I am using the http://myhost/foo/bar method fine on an Apache 0.8.14
installation, but I wish to upgrade and retain this facility.

Any clues ?

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 24 08:19:10 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The report is correct.  Somewhere in the parsing process
it is getting confused because of the path info which
results in it thinking that paths are entirely different
than they should be.  The fix is not obvious.

A misleading error message lead to user confusion.  This has
been fixed in 1.2b8-dev.
