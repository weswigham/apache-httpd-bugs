Apache 1.3.6
>Description:
With Apache1.2.5 we created .htaccess files with a separate line for each require user statement e.g

<Files index.html>
require user bob
require user ben
require user dan
</Files>

With Apache1.3.6 only the first user is allowed access; the other lines are ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
We can workaround by putting all the users on one line of course (as specified in the new documentation):

require user bob ben dan

But is it possible to make the old style .htaccess files work properly ?
In this small example it doesn't matter but we have many users who have created
large .htaccess files with lots of usernames in.
