>Environment:
Slackware 3.1 patched to run Linux 2.0.30
>Description:
When I accessed http://catalogue.spotimage.fr:8001/ via mod_proxy, all
underlined input fields were missing.

If we access the same page without using Apache 1.2.4 as a proxy or
using our corporate proxy server (Netscape), we don't have this problem.

This site is enhanced with Netscape.  However,
I have verified the problem with Netscape 3.0, IE 3.02, and Lynx 2.5.  
>How-To-Repeat:
To repeat this problem, 
  Access http://cataloge.spotimage.fr:8001/
  Select "query by criteria"
    account name: (I'll mail it to you if you want to try.)
    password: (I'll mail it to you if you want to try.)
  Enter 29 in the first lat. and 95 in the first long.
    Example: lat.  : N 29
             long. : E 95
  Now, scroll down and select the "Send" button.
 
  If you access this site without using Apache 1.2.4 as 
  a proxy, you will see all the input fields and the "Send"
  button.

  However, if you use Apache as a proxy,those underline or
  boxed input fields and the "Send" button will disappear.

>Fix:
I'll look at the souce of the page when it appears OK
and see what so special about the content of this
page that caused mod_proxy to misbehave

State-Changed-Why:

Hmmm... strange.
I cannot believe that this is a Apache/mod_proxy bug,
because mod_proxy never touches the contents of a page.

Are you sure that the syntax of your form is correct?
Does it happen only with a single page or with others too?

 Ok, I believe you ;-)  however, there is definitely something wrong when
 
 Apache 1.2.4 deals with this *particular* page,
 http://catalogue.spotimage.fr:8001/www/dali/registered/s_req_crit.htmlx
 
 Below is the outcome of diff, where dali-1 is the source of the page
 when I used
 Apache as the proxy, dali-2 is the source of the page when I used CERN
 as the
 proxy.web:~$ diff dali-1 dali-20a1,7

 I have no idea why Apache (mod_proxy) ommits the first bytes of the
 page.
