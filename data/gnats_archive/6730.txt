Linux istore 2.2.14-5.0smp #1 SMP Tue Mar 7 21:01:40 EST 2000 i686 unknown  
>Description:
I have two servers, one is a Sun Solaris with apache 1.3.9 and the other is
a linux intel also running apache 1.3.9.

I´m trying to run a jsp file in the linux intel and i get the following error in
the log file:

[23/10/2000 16:00:58:076] (INFO) wrapper: Java VM spawned (PID=4401, PPID=4394)
[23/10/2000 16:01:18:085] (INFO) wrapper: watching processes (PID=4394,PPID=4393

[23/10/2000 16:01:45:426] (INFO) wrapper: Java VM spawned (PID=4423, PPID=4394)

but when I run the jsp file on the solaris it works fine.

i have checked all the configuration files.
