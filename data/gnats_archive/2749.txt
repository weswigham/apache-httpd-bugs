>Environment:
WinNT 4.0, SP 3 with MS VC++ 5.0
>Description:
Try to port mod_auth_kerb to winNT apache.  Adding MODULE_VAR_EXPORT and build the ApacheModuleAuthKerb.dll.  However, loading that dll will cause server
internal error.
>How-To-Repeat:
build mod_auth_kerb as ApacheModuleAuthKerb.dll and change http.conf to use it .  Do "net start apache", the server is up.  Try to access the server home page (not protected by kerberos), the server returns with internal error. The same code work without problem on the unix version.
>Fix:
I can give more tracing info if I know what to change to debug this problem.
I can also send you the ApacheModuleAuthKerb.dll so some one could look at it.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid that we really can't help with broken third
party code.  This problem is almost certainly somewhere
within the module you are trying to run.

There is a chance that this is caused by a problem in Apache,
but that chance is quite low and it is far more likely that
the module is broken in some way.
