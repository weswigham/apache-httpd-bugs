>Organization:
>Environment:
Win98 OS - AMD K-6 200Mhz - 32 Meg RAM - Apache 1.3.6 Precompiled 
>Description:
After Apache has been running for 6 to 24 hours, it fails to respond
to HTTP request.  Calling a host or document from Apache will time
out.  Shutting down Apache with 'CTRL-C" and re-launching a new
process (apache.exe) will allow documents to be served once more,
but this one will also fail to serve after several hours.

Re-booting the system (cold boot *or* warm boot, either one)
does *not* resolve the problem.  Re-installing Apache does
not resolve the problem.  Problem cannot be resolved by
any conventional means.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run Apache (1.3.6) on W98 system.  Check agian in 24 hours, Apache
should fail to respond to HTTP request.
>Fix:
None.

State-Changed-Why:
What kind of requests are you serving? Static pages? CGI 
scripts? What language are the CGI scripts written in? 
What is MaxRequestsPerChild set to? ThreadsPerChild? 
How many concurrent clients? Any information that you can
provide that will help me recreate the problem is useful.
Thanks.

 What I have found is, as I was running Apache (Win32) on a server
 operating on a temporary dial up connection, the DUN connection
 was periodically being dropped.  Under NT4, a connection was 
 re-established automatically.  However, when a data connection
 was lost and re-established, Apache failed to respond to HTTP
 request until it was restarted.  The exact same server with the
 same software is now running on a 10Base-T connection and
 has yet to fail in over 120 days of 24X7 operation.

Glad to hear the success.  Apache is not designed to work
in a dialup make/break and ip reassignment scheme.  It was
built to do exactly what you are now doing :)

Congrats and thanks for your interest in the Apache Project.
