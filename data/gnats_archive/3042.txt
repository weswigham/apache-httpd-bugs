>Description:
The code for string comparison in function end_nested_section() line 1093 uses 
logical compare operator (!=) instead of strcmp().  The code should look like:

if (strcmp(cmd->cmd->name, cmd->end_token)) {

instead of:

if (cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token) {

State-Changed-Why:
This is a bug in the compiler you are using.  From what I
understand, it has been acknowledged by the team responsible
for the compiler but I'm not aware of any fix being available yet.

What you describe is a workaround, but it is not necessary and
it is not a bug in Apache; the address would be the same on
any non-buggy compiler.

 Because the intention is _NOT_ to compare strings here.  It is quite
 deliberate that a pointer to the same string is passed around.  There is
 no sense in doing a string compare with the extra overhead for no reason.
 
 Code as simple as:
 
 static const char a[] = "astring";
 const char *const g = a;
 int main() {
     const char *const b = a;
     printf("%p %p\n", g,b);
 }
 
 (sample from the compiler development team) is broken.  
 
 This version of IBM's compiler is bogusly changing the address so that
 when you have two things that are supposed to be pointers to the same
 address, one isn't.

Comment-Added:
The AIX compiler problem which gave the error of
"on Expected </Files> but saw </Files>"  has been fixed.
+  A set of PTF's which correct the problem are available from:
+  http://service.software.ibm.com/support/rs6000
+  The PTF's are:  U462005, U462006, U462007, and U462023 through
+  U462030.  The PTF's have been tested and do indeed fix the problem.

Thanks for using Apache
