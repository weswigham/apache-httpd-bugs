>Description:
I ssi include a fastcgi application, and the first few times the page loads it is ok. After the first 1-3, all of the html after the ssi include disappears. If you wait a while then try it again, it'll be back but disappear after the first 1-3 hits once more. I've tried it with no luck on Apache 1.3b2 and 1.3b3. This is with the latest mod_fastcgi (2.0.8) from http://fastcgi.idle.com/. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I will try to leave my test httpd running at:
http://www.idle.com:8080/test.html
You can turn off images to make it quicker. You'll see "end testing" at the bottom of the page. Reload it a couple of times, and that will disappear.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid we can't support problems that only appear when
using some external module, such as fastcgi, because they
are more often than not the fault of that module rather
than Apache.

Unless you can reproduce this using normal CGIs, there isn't
really anything we can do.  You should take this up with
fastcgi support channels.

   Right, no problem. Someone suggested I report it to the Apache list, so I
 did. Even if a cgi fails, the error would be logged and the rest of the
 page appear you'd think. Ah well. There _aren't_ any fastcgi support
 channels any more. ;) OpenMarket officially dropped support and the few
 people willing to debug it are all overworked. I couldn't even pay them to
 try looking at it. Alas.
 
   Thanks for the reply and have a great weekend,
