>Description:
Adding
ApJservAction .jsp /servlets/gnujsp/
or
ApJservAction .jsp /servlets/org.gjt.jsp.JspServlet/
doesn't appear to work.
calling the jsp file just returns the source, whilst using /servlets/gnujsp/some-file.jsp
works ok.
>How-To-Repeat:
If you put the example date.jsp in the web / and 
get /date.jsp the source of the jsp file is returned
but calling the servlet directly is ok
>Fix:
#in httpd.conf add
AddHandler java-server-page .jsp
# and, assuming you use a servlet alias for GnuJSP
Action java-server-page /servlets/gnujsp/

 Did you try this:
 
 ApJservAction .jsp /servlets/org.gjt.jsp.JspServlet
 
 >>Fix:
 > #in httpd.conf add

 > # and, assuming you use a servlet alias for GnuJSP

 That is just another way to do the same thing.
