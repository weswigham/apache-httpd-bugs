>Description:
Maybe it's just because there is not support for this in the W32 version, but I could find not report to that effect.

Here's some of my error log

[Fri Dec 04 13:18:10 1998] [warn] [client 163.206.155.127] handler "server-info" not found for: d:/clcs-web/server-info
[Fri Dec 04 13:18:10 1998] [error] [client 163.206.155.127] File does not exist: d:/clcs-web/server-info
>How-To-Repeat:
No, because as configured, this should not be accessible to anyone other
than this IP.

If you could, the URL would be http://kw1517572.ksc.nasa.gov/server-info
>Fix:
Include the support in the next revision of the W32 version,
or report this and any other features that are not yet functional
W32 version.  I'd just like to be able to determine (without bugging you)
wether a W32 'problem' is something just not yet supported, doesn't work
right, or should work right (might be my problem).  Some html page stating
W32 issues.

Forgive my ignorance if something like this already exists.

Sincerely, Scott Thorne

State-Changed-Why:
Did you uncomment the appropriate LoadModule line to load
the status module?

If you are in doubt, the place to ask (as stated clearly
before you submit a bug report) is in the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows Usenet group.
Searching old posts there will also tell you a lot.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, misread the bug report.  No, mod_info is a different
module.  Since it is not distributed with the binary version
of Apache or in the default config file, then you should
assume that it doesn't currently work on Win32.  There
are various reports in the bugdb about this already.

 Ok, sorry to bug you about it then.  I wasn't able to find anything in the
 DB on this.  I did try.
 
 Thanks.
