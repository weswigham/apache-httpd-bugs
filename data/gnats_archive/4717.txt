Hi,

Firstly, I am sorry as you said that you don't provide support for C... but I have this just one more simple cute question. Would you be please kind enough to help me? It requires just one line answer.

Here goes:

In mod_cgi.c, when it pipes the data to a CGI, which variable contains the data which is sent as piped data? And which function calls the main piping routine.

Thanx.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!
