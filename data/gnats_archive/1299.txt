>Description:
Unlike not finding an HTML page, if you do not find the CGI script, you get only
the error message:

script not found or unable to stat

With NO mention of the name of the path/filename used that generated the error.

Yes, you could cross reference this with a transfer or custom log but this
is a bit of extra work and if you do not generate a transfer log you are 
really lost.  The filename was included in 1.2.4 logs.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Output the filename of failed CGI scripts in the error log
