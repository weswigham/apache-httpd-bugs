>Release:        1.3.4
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT/95/98
>Description:
The Apache Jserv jar file has been incorrectly named as ApacheJServ
wrapper.classpath=C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache JServ\ApacheJServ.jar

It should be changed to Apache-JServ.jar as shown below to match with your new naming convention
wrapper.classpath=C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache JServ\Apache-JServ.jar

Failure to do so causes the JVM to crash when calling JServ from the web server.
>How-To-Repeat:
After installing the web server and JServ bring up the JServ status page and probe the Mapped Servlet Engines URL. You should get an internal server error.
>Fix:
Sync up the names of the jar file in the jserv.properties configuration file.
