>Description:
It is a pity that the rotation of log files is not handled by the server's log
module itself but has to be done by the additional rotatelogs program.
This program should also be enhanced (I have done this myself) by taking into
account the local timezone and DST and using a readable time as file extension
instead of the internal Unix time, for instance, file.YYMMDDhh (no resolution
below an hour will be required; thus I changed the rotation-period argument
into days[.hours]). But all this should be built into the log module itself.
Further it should be possible to specify host-address patterns whose access
should not be logged (e.g., the local domain or local search robots).
Even the old CERN httpd allows this. I also built this into rotatelogs in a
very crude way, but this is clumsy.
>How-To-Repeat:
N.A.
>Fix:
Own hacks to rotatelogs.c, but would prefer change of mod_log_config

State-Changed-Why:
This has been discussed many times, and the conclusion was
that there is no point in adding hard-coded, fixed utility
code to the logging module when people can do whatever they
want with piped logs.  If you try to support what everyone
wants in the logging module itself, it becomes so bloated
it is crazy.
