>Description:
I have it up and running and I can access from a browser using http://38.252.195.2

my server name is uscit.gov how do I set it up so someone can find it by the address name www.uscit.gov or at least uscit.gov

OR where can I find the docs to explain how to do this.

State-Changed-Why:
This is not an Apache issue.  You need to contact your
network administrator or Internet provider and have them setup the DNS.
In your case, it looks like PSI are the ones to talk to.
