State-Changed-When: Tue Feb 23 20:28:24 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Get a clue.  As the message you get says, we have nothing to
do with the website and can do nothing about your problem.

Would you complain to Microsoft if the machine put up a
message saying it was running Windows?  Of course not.
