Redhat Linux 5.2
Java JDK1.1.7 and JDK1.2
JSDK2.0
>Description:
I want to upload files to server from browser using servlet. In webpage,
I set ENCTYPE=multipart/form-data. When the value of request.getContentLength() 
is greater than a specified limited number, I don't read any message from 
request, and response to this request as "The file is too large". But I got 
"Internal Server Error" message in the side of browser, with "cannot scan
servlet headers" record in servlet log file.

Besides these, during the period of reading file, if I run a throw command 
because the file is too long, the same result will be displayed.

 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I can't find any method to fix it.
