>Description:
a quick patch to ab.c that lets you specify a file on the command line
that containes a list of strings to append to the url that is requested
of the server being fetched.  this trivially lets one bench mark against
full trees.. it uses writev() to avoid tons of string munging.  quick, probably
not bug free, but I hope useful to someone.
