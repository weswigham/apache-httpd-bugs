 Hi,
 
 To set the alias like  'bigdaddy' for 'localhostname',
 enter the following resource record in the
 Domain Name Server's named database file(which maps
 Host name to IP address). 
 
 localhostname  IN A XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX 
 bigdaddy IN CNAME localhostname 
 
 where XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is IP address 
 
 and restart the Domain Name Server. Now you can view
 web pages using alias name.
