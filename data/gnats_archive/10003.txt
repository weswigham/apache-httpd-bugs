Linux 2.4.2-2 i686 unknown
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81)
>Description:
When using a variant with very large content (>100 lines) per section as an ErrorDocument, apache hangs at the first request, also sucking up all system resources (cpu). With mozilla 0.9.8, no content is ever displayed in the browser; with IE 5.5, broken content appears (delivered page starting at seemingly random point in variant).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Check for infinite loops or recursions in mod_negotiation as well as doubtful buffersize restrictions.

State-Changed-Why:
This seems to be a problem in file buffering in APR on
Unix.  As a work-around, you can change mod_negotiation
to stop using buffered file I/O.  In function read_type_map
in file modules/mappers/mod_negotiation.c, there is a 
call to apr_file_open near the start of the function.
Comment out "| APR_BUFFERED" (in the 3rd parameter to
apr_file_open) and rebuild and your problem should go away.

Can you try that and verify that you don't have any further
problems?  That got rid of the consume-all-memory behavior
with HTTP/1.1 requests and I started getting reasonable
responses for other HTTP levels as well.

(And now, back to debugging buffered I/O :( )

Here's the real fix:
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apr/file_io/unix/seek.c.diff?r1=1.24&r2=1.25&diff_format=h

This will be in the next release of Apache 2.0.

Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache!
