Subject: Fails to read default pre-written html directory index (index.html)

# uname -a
SCO_SV bridge 3.2 2 i386

The OS is SCO enterprise development system 5.0.2c

# cc -V
SCO UNIX Development System  Release 5.0.0a 16Mar95

>Description:
I've checked the docs, FAQ, etc., and the only potential cause noted for this
particular problem is in http_request.c line 185.  However, errno.h appears to
be included in the build for SCO5 (httpd.h -> conf.h -> errno.h).

The config file srm.conf has the following definition:

# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
 
DirectoryIndex index.html
>How-To-Repeat:
Access http://www.ebc.org  followed by an access to http://www.ebc.org/index.html

The access log records the following:


squid.ncsa.uiuc.edu - - [30/Jun/1997:08:17:48 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 304 -
squid.ncsa.uiuc.edu - - [30/Jun/1997:08:17:54 -0500] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
squid.ncsa.uiuc.edu - - [30/Jun/1997:08:17:54 -0500] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 304 -

As noted, the first GET return the banner "Welcome to ebc.org" (which is not contained
in files on our web site), and does not return the default Apache 'success' file index.html.
The second GET, however, successfully returns the default Apache 'success' file.

State-Changed-Why:
I can see no difference in behavior between the two URLs.
It appears like you are accessing it through a proxy; if
you had a different web server running on the box in the
past, it may be caching the results from that.  Please try
accessing it directly without any proxy.

 Thanks Marc - it appears to be working ok now.  The problem was in the
 client I was using to access the apache server.
