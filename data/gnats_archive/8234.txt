uanme output:  2.4.7 #2 SMP Mon Aug 20 14:46:33 BST 2001 i686 unknown
gcc --version output 2.96
redhat 7.1 based system. (minimal install)
>Description:
make complained it couldn't find nbdm.h while trying to compile mod_auth_dbm. 
gdbm-1.8.0.5 and gdbm-devel-1.8.0-5 were installed, as were db1-1.85-5.i386.rpm 
and db1-devel-1.85-5.i386.rpm.
>How-To-Repeat:
I've not had time or the facilities to prove it happens on a plain
redhat 7.1 box, but looking at the way I fixed it, it might well do.
>Fix:
I ended up replacing mod_auth_dbm.c from apache 1.3.19 which 
seems to have fixed the problem. Looking in the source there's an extra 3 lines 
in the 1.3.19 version that isn't in the 1.3.20 version. Diffing the two versions gets
diff (1.3.20 version) (1.3.19 version)
