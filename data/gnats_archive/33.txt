>Description:
I have tried changing the line in Configuration to :
Rule WANTHSREGEX=yes

and re-running ./Configure. The result is:
# make
make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 38: Unexpected end of line seen

The Makefile around line 38 looks like:
###############
# Platform: SunOS 4
# Final Rules:
#  Rule WANTHSREGEX=default
yes
###############

The line that says "yes" is line 38. I've tried fixing that line
in the Makefile, but none of these work:

##Rule:WANTHSREGEX=yes

#  Rule WANTHSREGEX=default
WANTHSREGEX=yes

or 
#  Rule WANTHSREGEX=yes

State-Changed-Why:

This has already been fixed for the next release, but to get
you started...  all you need to do is add

    -DUSEBCOPY

to EXTRA_CFLAGS (in Configuration) and replace

    Rule WANTHSREGEX=default

with

    Rule WANTHSREGEX=yes

and re-run Configure and then make.  Please delete
any other lines you added that involve WANTHSREGEX
(even ones that might look like comments).

These changes will be the default for 1.2b2 on SunOS 4.
