>Description:
I compiled, and installed apache 1.3.3 on 3 RH 5.1 linux systems. 
Regular access is no problem. The problem is that now i am
unable to access users public_html dirs. This problem occured
on the third system, but has now occured on all 3, since i tried
to see where i went wrong by removing apache from all 3 and doing
it over again.
I followed the simple compilation procedure exactly

./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/apache
make 
make install

P.S. I didn't install the Apache dist. that came with RH5.1

State-Changed-Why:
Since you decline to mention what shows up in the error log,
as explicitly requested before you submit a PR, I'm afraid
we can't help you.  We don't just ask you to do those things
for your health.

It is almost certain that either you are missing world read
permissions on the directory in question or some directory
above it or you don't have a "<Directory /foo>" section in your
config file that allows access to the home directories.
