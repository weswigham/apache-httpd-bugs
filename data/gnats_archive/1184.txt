>Description:
I updated from NCSA 1.5.2 to Apache 1.2.4. In the course of doing so I found 
that headers and footers on files generated by a perl script were no longer 
working.
 
I found it was caused by the presence of the double back slash
at the end of the parameter lines, such as in the following:

<!-- BANNER HEADER FOR NGP PAGES>
<!--#exec cmd="/www/common/bin/cgi-bin/generate_part.pl \\
        project=ngp \\
        title=\"NGP Council\" \\
        author=\"A. Person\" \\
        email=\"aperson\" \\
        date=\"22 Sep 1997\" \\
        rev=\"\\$Revision: 0.4 $\" \\
"-->

The double backslash is necessary with NCSA.

Unfortunately, most of our web pages, of which there are lots, have this
format. Is there is a way around it, other than editing all the files?

State-Changed-Why:

I'm afraid you have to change your pages.
I don't know why NCSA needs a double slash, but Apache
is happy with a single slash and I wouldn't call this
an Apache bug.
