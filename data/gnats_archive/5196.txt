>Description:
Sending a POST message with a missing resource (POST HTTP/1.1), and the server
responds with HTML markup and no header.  The markup looks like such:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>400 Bad Request</TITLE>
</HEAD></BODY> ....

Tested this versus a Microsoft Web server and it behaved correctly.

State-Changed-Why:
I seen no problem with Apache's behaviour.

A HTTP request must be either a method and a URI or it must
be a method and a URI and a protocol version.

The first case is for HTTP/0.9.  The latter is for HTTP/1.0
and 1.1.  Apache treats your request as a HTTP/0.9 request
which happens to have a invalid URI.  That is a perfectly
valid way of treating it (and, arguably, the only valid way).

Since HTTP/0.9 responses do not include response headers,
Apache doesn't include them in that response.

 Good point.  Yes that makes sense now, and I agree that is the "correct" way to handle that type of malformed request, since the protocol expects the URI to immediately follow the method.
 
 Thanks for your quick response.
