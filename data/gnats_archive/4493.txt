>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
OS : Linux 2.2.9 (RH 5.1 upgraded) on i586
Compiler : egcs 1.1.2
Glibc : 2.1.1
>Description:
Happens with ./configure, with ./configure USE_APACI=1 [+ other args],
or via mod-perl 1.19

My "make" ends by :

gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DLINUX=2 -DUSE_HSREGEX `../apaci` http_main.c
http_main.c: In function `make_sock':
http_main.c:3054: `SOL_SOCKET' undeclared (first use in this function)
http_main.c:3054: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
http_main.c:3054: for each function it appears in.)
http_main.c:3054: `SO_REUSEADDR' undeclared (first use in this function)
http_main.c:3065: `SO_KEEPALIVE' undeclared (first use in this function)
http_main.c:3099: `SO_SNDBUF' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[3]: *** [http_main.o] Error 1
  etc...
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
downloaded a new tar.gz of apache : same result
not a compiler pb : I upgraded gcc 2.7.2.3 -> egcs 1.1.2
not a glibc pb :    "     "    glibc 2.0.x -> glibc 2.1.1
Might it be a pb on another lib ?
