>Description:
I am trying to set up user authentication on 1.3.1 Win32 version of Apache. 
It has come to my attention that htpasswd is used to create these files.
However, I cannot find this file in the Binary distribution.  Is there a way I
can generate the user/password files in Windows?  I do have access to a Unix box 
but I have no C compiler.

State-Changed-Why:
You are right, there isn't.  As the docs say, currently
the passwords are not encrypted on Win32 so there is no need
for one.  The password file is just a bunch of : seperated
lines listing username:password, eg.

user1:password1
user2:password2
..etc...
