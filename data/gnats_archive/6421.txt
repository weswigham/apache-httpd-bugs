>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Apache/1.3.12, everything static, on Linux 2.0.38
>Description:
When requesting a nonexistent "directory/" with Available documents, mod_speling incorrectly appends a slash ("/") to the common basename of a file in the 'Available documents' list. Clicking this link on the 'Available documents' list gives a 404.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put a document named old.html in the webroot. Then request http://yoursite/old/ (including the trailing slash), on which mod_speling generates a 300 Multiple Choices with "/old.html/" (common basename) including a "/" (slash) at the end of the filename, which is incorrect - old.html is a doc and not a directory. Clicking the link gives a 404.
>Fix:
Sorry, I can complain only :) Good luck.
