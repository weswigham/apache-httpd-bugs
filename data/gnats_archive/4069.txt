>Description:
mod_userdir allows an admin to dissociate the /etc/passwd home directory
for a user from the doc that gets returned on a ~username URL request.
SuEXEC only understands the (typical) ~user/public_html/ as a docroot for
individual users, and won't execute requests outside that directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
In httpd.conf:
UserDir /htdocs/userdirs/
put a CGI-script under that userdir, and try to GET it
>Fix:
modify util_script.c to never pass the '~' on the command line to
SuEXEC, and remove the ~user/public_html check from SuEXEC, when an
appropriate directive is in the httpd.conf for the request.  If y'all
accept the patch I recently sent in, the flag already exists in the
URIOwner config directive.

State-Changed-Why:

suexec doesn't work with mod_userdir at all.  Instead,
it can accept only two locations: the user's actual home
directory (as specified in /etc/passwd), or a subdirectory
of that as specified by the USERDIR_SUFFIX macro.  You
can define USERDIR_SUFFIX with ./configure using
the --suexec-userdir option.  It is a design parameter of
suexec that all possible parameters be specified at
compile-time rather than run-time; this is one of those.
Changing this would weaken suexec's security.  See
<http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html> for more info.

Thanks for using Apache!
