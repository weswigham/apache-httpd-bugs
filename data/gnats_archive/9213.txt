 Back of "THE NET" :: 2002 Long Island All Girls All Star Team being Formed
 ...........................................................

 Washington Freedom with Mia Hamm Accept our Challenge
 
 2002 Long Island All Girls All Star Team Seeking Players=20
 
 Long Island, New York - December 20, 2001 -=20
 Once again we are putting together a team of some of Long Island's best fem=
 ale players to play some of the world's best players including the FIFA fem=
 ale player of the year, MIA HAMM.=20
 
 This year Jim Gabarra, coach of the Washington Freedom accepted the challen=
 ge on JKI to have the Washington Freedom including Mia play our All Star Te=
 am in Washington. Additionally, the Boston Breakers and Philadelphia Charge=
  have responded positively to our invitation, and we expect that after the =
 WUSA 2002 schedule is in place that we will have a green light to play both=
  those teams.  As a courtesy to our host teams we will roster 18 of the 25 =
 players from Long Island/ENY and look to have 7 guest players from the host=
  city join our team.  Should the NY Power accept our request for a game all=
  25 girls will be local (read local as a member of an ENYYSA team).
 
 Any girl who is currently playing U-16 or older or is in college and  will =
 play U-19 this Spring is encouraged to respond.  Please email larry@backoft=
 henet.com with your NAME, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE #, DOB, CURRENT TEAM, and BRIE=
 F BIO.  It is not anticipated that there will be tryouts.  This is an ad ho=
 c team with no affiliation and no agenda other than the pure fun of playing=
  and the chance for some of our girls to play against the best and to be co=
 ached by the best.  I don't know who will coach the team yet, but it appear=
 s that there will be a different high profile coach for each game and if we=
  do get to play the NY Power we hope Tony DiCicco will come back.
 
 We also would like to know when you send us a note if you have been accepte=
 d to a college or where you are applying.  If you are a junior or a sophmor=
 e playing up (U-16 or higher) you are invited to reply.  We may make up a d=
 ifferent or partially different team if we get to play teams other than the=
  Freedom so more girls can have the experience that was enjoyed by our team=
  last year.  Again, this is simply for fun and a good time and for an exper=
 ience you might not otherwise get.  We hope to hear from you.
 
 Do the RUDY!!
 
 Do The RUDY in 2002
 =20
 Become part of History, Compete in the 35th Annual Rudy Lamonica Memorial I=
 ndoor Soccer Tournament.  The Oldest Indoor Youth Soccer Tournament in the =
 United States.  To Commemorate our 35th year we are planning lots of surpri=
 ses.  All coaches will receive a commemorative soccer ball, Every participa=
 nt will receive a gift and every Intramural player will receive a trophy.  =
 Our interactive cafeteria will be even better than last year when we first =
 introduced it. Deadline for applications is December 30, 2001 for Travel Te=
 ams and January 20, 2002 for Intramural Teams.  Don't get locked out bracke=
 ts are filling up fast.  For more information please visit www.ousc.com, E-=
 Mail us at ousctourn@aol.com or contact: Al Haft at 516-536-1001 or Pete Bu=
 ssa at 516-536-7808.=20
 =20
 Don't miss out on our best Tournament in 35 years.  Do the RUDY in 2002, Be=
 come part of History.
 
 Also, Please make note, that the correct date for the Boys U11 and the Boys=
  U12 is January 20, 2002.
 
 Where's The Money?
 
 Remember the 911 New York Soccer Foundation? Remember all the the money the=
 y collected? Reports of $50,000, $60,000 , $70,000 and one report that circ=
 ulated quoted even more money. Where is it? I don't know and I can't find a=
 nyone in charge who wants to say. It is Christmas in a few days and what I =
 have learned is that Chris Galluzzo, the head of this organization is not r=
 esponding to my inquiries on behalf of soccer community members as to an ac=
 counting of those funds. It was supposed to be that the money was to go to =
 families in need affected by the 911 tragedy by Christmas, however one of t=
 he leaders of this organization, Marie Kufer, the GM of the Huntington Hilt=
 on tells me that no receipients have yet to be identified and also skirted =
 the issue of offering us any accounting and also skirted the issue as to th=
 e bill given to 911 for the use of the Hotel facitities which I was told wa=
 s gratis. Bottom line, where is the money, how much was deposited in the ba=
 nk, what were the expenses, who incurred the expenses and how much was paid=
  to them, how much (if any) is left and to whom is it being paid and the am=
 ount?
