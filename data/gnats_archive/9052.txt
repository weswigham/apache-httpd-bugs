>Organization:
>Environment:
AIX 5.1.0.0, gcc-3.0.2
>Description:
When max_requests_per_child was renamed to ap_max_requests_per_child and command
processing moved to core.c, mpm/perchild.c was not updated completely.
perchild.c does not use the core.c variable which causes it to ignore the value
in the configuration file and always use the default.
>How-To-Repeat:
Inspect perchild.c.
Set MaxRequestsPerChild in httpd built to use perchild.c and observe that
the configuration file has no effect on the number of requests that the child
handles before it is killed.
>Fix:
Make perchild.c consistent with other MPM modules.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Sun Mar 31 16:33:12 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
As of today, the perchild MPM uses the correct value for
MaxRequestsPerChild
