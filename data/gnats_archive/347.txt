BSDi 2.1
gcc version 1.42
>Description:
Apache compiles correctly and starts without any errors.
A connection to port 80 will happen, but any request 
(eg: GET / HTTP/1.0) does not return results.  Nothing 
appears in the log files except that the server has started.

This problem does not exist in 1.2b6 and before.

I was able to get 1.2b8 compiled and running on a seperate BSDi 
2.1 box.  I moved the binary to the machine in question and it failed as 
described above.  I believe it could be a configuration problem, the machine
in question handles about 175 domains.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unknown how to repeat it, but I'm willing to give you
my configuration files and/or let you see the problem
for yourselves.

State-Changed-Why:

You say that you moved the executable from one machine to
another.  Do both machines have identical system libraries?
Customizations like increasing FD_SETSIZE require compilation
on the same system as the running server.

Version 1.2.1 will contain a workaround and documentation for
this problem.
