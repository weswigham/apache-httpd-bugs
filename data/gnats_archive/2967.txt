Digital UNIX
>Description:
I know it's our own fault for renaming the operating system from OSF/1 to 
Digital UNIX, but it's now been called Digital UNIX for at least two years. The
name changed happened somewhere between v3.0 and v3.2 I think.   I think it
would be less confusing if you referred to the OS as "Digital UNIX".
