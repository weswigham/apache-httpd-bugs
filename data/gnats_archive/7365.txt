State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: abagchi
State-Changed-When: Tue Mar  6 13:05:20 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The proxy module has not worked with Apache 2.0 for some time.
We have a proxy module group working on this problem, and the
development list is modproxy-dev@apache.org.  The referenced
header files have been removed from the HTTP tree, and should 
be removed from the proxy as they port it to 2.0.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jun 15 15:20:35 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The proxy has been rewritten since this was analyzed, and
it compiles now.  If you have any more problems, please let
us know.  Thank you for using Apache.
