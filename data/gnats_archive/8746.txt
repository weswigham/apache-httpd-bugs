First - sorry... I`m from Poland and my english isn`t good... :(

I installed Apache and configured it. All *.conf are 100% OK.
When I want to see my webpage from localhost - OK. The problem is when I`m trying to do it from other comp in LAN (they all are `98SE) via standard port - 80 (or <1024)- apache gives no respond.
I searched on all newsgroups I know and still I don`t know the answer - PLEASE HELP!!!

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
