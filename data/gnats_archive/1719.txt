Solaris 2.5, etc
>Description:
In http_main.c, every failed call to a pthreads library function
(pthread_mutex_init(), etc) is followed by perror(). Since pthread
library functions do not set errno, this may produce confusing
error messages.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
use something like this:
void mt_perror(const char *str, int err)
{
	fprintf(stderr, "%s: Error %d (%s)\n", str, err, strerror(err));
