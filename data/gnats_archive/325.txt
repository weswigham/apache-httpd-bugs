Solaris 2.5, compiled using gcc-2.7.2
>Description:
Cannot use VirtualHost _default_ or default in httpd.conf or srm.conf. Apache refuses to start up and
reports that default cannot be resolved.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
If I have misunderstood the syntax for this, please provide example of its use on the web page describing VirtualHost.
If I haven't, do not perform DNS check where the parameter to VirtualHost is the specific word "default"

State-Changed-Why:
The docs on the site are for 1.2b8 which will be released in
a few days... _default_ is new in 1.2b8.  Sorry about that.
You can grab a snapshot at ftp://ftp.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs
if you want 1.2b8 early.
