I hope you can help me. Don't know what else to do. I'm a novice.
I apologize for my bad english.

How can i configure two http sever on a single machine? i.e., i've
a server name, say www.pegaso-ip.it, on a machine and need to add another
name, www.pescepietro.it (it has another ip address), on the same machine.
Is it possible? I tried virtual host and to start another http server 
for www.pescepietro.it but with no result.
Do I have to try with virtual host or with something else?
I must specify two different ports for the two names?

does www.pescepietro.it must be a cname for www.pegaso-ip.it?

My DNS , which maintains the two domains, is on a different machine from
one where runs apache. 
pegaso-ip.it is my domain name, the domain pescepietro.it is maintained
on the same machine.

Thanks

This is not the place to ask basic configuration questions.

You should read the docs on vhosts at
http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/ (well, first you should upgrade
to a current version of Apache, since not all of the things
there apply to old versions like 1.2.x) and if you still can't
figure it out, post in the appropriate Usenet newsgroup,
as you are very clearly told to do before submitting a bug
report if you aren't sure your problem is a bug in Apache.
