>Description:
Hello,
I've seen two minor problems with NameVirtualHosts:
- If I say "ServerPath /something", then telnet into port 80 and
  request GET /something, I get a message saying the document moved
  permanently to http://myip/something rather than the index.html file
  for the server. http://myip/something (obviously) returns a message
  saying it has moved permanently to itself.
- UseCanonicalName On is ignored for NameVirtualHosts.
>How-To-Repeat:
By using a similar setup - the computer I'm testing this on is not
yet connected to the net.
>Fix:
Not yet - maybe later.

 I can't reproduce this.  Are you _sure_ it isn't redirecting you to
 /something/ ?  There is a big difference between /something and
 /something/

 What do you mean?  Are you setting UseCanonicalName off in your main
 server config then setting it on in a vhost?  Please give an example
 config along with what requests you are trying and what you expect.  It
 works fine for me.

 You're right - guess I should have tried getting a pre-HTTP/1.1 client
 rather than telnetting into port 80 to simulate it.

 What I'm trying to do is this:
 
 NameVirtualHost 198.22.51.242
 <VirtualHost 198.22.51.242>
 ServerName www.startrek.eu.org
 ServerAlias www.startrek.eu.org startrek.eu.org
 ServerAlias www.startrek.eu.org tng.startrek.eu.org
 UseCanonicalName On
 </VirtualHost>
 
 I'm expecting it to use www.startrek.eu.org rather than the two other
 hostnames for it. (But the problem might be that there simply aren't
 ans self-referential URLs - I'm not yet very familiar with HTTP
 internals.)
 I've found out that
 <VirtualHost 198.22.51.242>
 ServerName startrek.eu.org
 RedirectMatch (.*) http://www.startrek.eu.org$1
 </VirtualHost>
 Is a better match for what I'm trying to do, anyway.
