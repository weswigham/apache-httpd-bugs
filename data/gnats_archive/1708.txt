I am running the server on RedHat Linux 5.0, gcc compiler		

Linux ali.v4h.net 2.0.32 #1 Fri Jan 16 19:57:00 EST 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
The server is functional. The only problem is that when I try to access a 
perl document in the cgi-bin I get the "server boo boo" error. Which is fine, 
except I can't fixit because the error_log does not contain the information
about the error.  I did not specify to use any other log than the defualt one
in /usr/local/apache/logs.  The log does contain the information about the starting 
and stopping of the server. The odd thing is that it worked before?
>How-To-Repeat:
Nonfuntional Error Log?
Error log does not contain server mistakes
My error log does not work!!		
>Fix:
I tried everything from reinstalling to reconfiguring....%3

State-Changed-Why:
Are you using a piped error log?

I can't report this problem.

State-Changed-Why:
Er, I meant to say "I can't repeat this problem".  At any
rate, try reading the documentation on the LogLevel directive
and set LogLevel to debug.  It should be in httpd.conf if you're
using the default config files.  Does that help?
