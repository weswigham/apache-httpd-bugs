>Description:
If I do not wish to use suexec, but instead use our own cgiwrap program that
enforces more strict control on cgi scripts, I must comment out the below 
section from mod_cgi because it forces the user to set the cgi scripts as the
same gid/uid of the server.

    if (!suexec_enabled) {
        if (!can_exec(&r->finfo))
            return log_scripterror(r, conf, FORBIDDEN,
                                   "file permissions deny server execution");
    }

>How-To-Repeat:
Dont use suexec and try and execute a cgi script as some other uid/gid than the
server.
>Fix:
Yes!
Please make this "force user to use same uid/gid as server" a compile time option

 The last line of can_exec is:
 
 return (finfo->st_mode & S_IXOTH);
 
 Do you not have the o+x bit set?

 P.S. I'm having a hard time figuring why we use can_exec, except to maybe
 make the log look prettier.

   Why would I want other people on my system able to execute other peoples 
 cgi-bin files, just so the web server can do it? In my opinion this 
 "requirement" that cgi-bin's either be called using apache's suexec program or 
 be set world executable is unacceptable, and should be placed as a compile 
 time option.
 
   When placed as a compile time option maybe it can be described as apache 
 enforcing file mode checking or something.
 
   However, we have our own cgi-bin wrapper that does more extensive checks, 
 logging, and then the change of user id before execution than the one shipped 
 with apache.  We would prefer to just use a compile time option instead of 
 having to patch every release before compiling.

 I think I mentioned in my previous response that I have no idea why that
 check is there to begin with.  It's probably just there to make the logged
 errors "prettier".  I just wanted to check that in fact you did not have
 o+x set.  I'll see about removing it.
 
 Thanks

 Wait a sec.  What are the permissions on your cgiwrap files?  You must
 have at least the gid set to the webserver's gid... otherwise how the heck
 are you executing them?
 
 can_exec checks essentially the same thing a call to access() would.
 
 Unless your cgiwrap files have uid == webserver's uid, or gid ==
 webserver's gid, and the appropriate x bit set.  Or it has the o+x bit set
 ... then you can't execute the file to begin with.  Unless you're running
 the webserver as root.

   Yes the gid is set to the webserver gid.

   Not running as root
 
   Let me explain a bit better...
 
   We run 2 web servers on our development box one using a cgiwrapper and one that just calls cgi programs strait out of the cgi-bin directory.  The user does testing in the none wrapped directory and once it works without the wrapping we make the necessa ry file gid/uid/mode changes and put it under the cgiwrapped server for more testing.
 
   When we upgraded both of them from the latest 1.2 beta to 1.2.1 the non-wrapped server cgi-bin's broke..giving the error message produced by can_exec.  I commented out that function call in the mod_cgi and everything went back to working. I assumed can _exec was a new addition...maybe I was wrong.
 
   Ill do some more testing on monday when I get in to work to make sure its the can_exec function that is causing the problem and not user error on our side. Thank you for the quick response..Ill be sure to send you an update on monday.

 Ok from "cvs annotate mod_cgi.c util.c" I get this (searching just for
 can_exec):
 
 1.30         (randy    25-Jan-97):     if (!suexec_enabled) {
 1.30         (randy    25-Jan-97):         if (!can_exec(&r->finfo))
 1.30         (randy    25-Jan-97):             return log_scripterror(r, conf, FORBIDDEN,
 1.30         (randy    25-Jan-97):                                    "file permissions deny server execution");
 1.30         (randy    25-Jan-97):     }
 
 And for can_exec() itself:
 
 1.61         (ben      13-Jul-97): API_EXPORT(int) can_exec(const struct stat *finfo) {
 1.22         (jim      02-Oct-96): #ifdef MULTIPLE_GROUPS
 1.19         (jim      23-Sep-96):   int cnt;
 1.22         (jim      02-Oct-96): #endif

 1.2          (ben      22-Feb-96):     /* OS/2 dosen't have Users and Groups */
 1.37         (randy    28-Dec-96):     return 1;
 1.2          (ben      22-Feb-96): #else
 1.1          (cvs      14-Jan-96):     if(user_id == finfo->st_uid)
 1.1          (cvs      14-Jan-96):         if(finfo->st_mode & S_IXUSR)
 1.1          (cvs      14-Jan-96):             return 1;
 1.22         (jim      02-Oct-96):     if(group_id == finfo->st_gid)
 1.22         (jim      02-Oct-96):         if(finfo->st_mode & S_IXGRP)
 1.22         (jim      02-Oct-96):             return 1;
 1.22         (jim      02-Oct-96): #ifdef MULTIPLE_GROUPS
 1.19         (jim      23-Sep-96):     for(cnt=0; cnt < NGROUPS_MAX; cnt++) {
 1.19         (jim      23-Sep-96):         if(group_id_list[cnt] == finfo->st_gid)
 1.19         (jim      23-Sep-96):             if(finfo->st_mode & S_IXGRP)
 1.19         (jim      23-Sep-96):                 return 1;
 1.19         (jim      23-Sep-96):     }
 1.22         (jim      02-Oct-96): #endif
 1.1          (cvs      14-Jan-96):     return (finfo->st_mode & S_IXOTH);
 1.2          (ben      22-Feb-96): #endif
 1.1          (cvs      14-Jan-96): }
 
 So it's all pretty old code.  (Note the annotations are from the HEAD
 which is 1.3a2-dev at the moment rather than 1.2.1 ...)
 
 But it looks to me like it should work if the file is gid of the webserver
 and g+x is set ... that's one of the tests in there.  So yeah if you
 could dig a bit further that'd be great.  Thanks

   It's starting to look like a use error on our side.  We have several web 
 admins and one of them had been messing with uid/gid settings on some of the 
 cgi-bin scripts when installing our wrapper.  When the server that did not 
 have the wrapper installed tried to execute the scripts it obviously failed.
 
   Please close out the bug report.
 
   I apologize for wasting your time, but encouraged to see the quick response 
 time and informative discussion.

I'm always happy closing out a bug report :)  Glad to know
it was just a local problem.  (Although we might update that
code anyhow, at least to make it more meaningful for suexec.)
