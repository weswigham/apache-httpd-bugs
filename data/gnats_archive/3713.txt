===========
Restarting the Apache process (kill -USR1 27312) spawns extra piped log programs
running.

State-Changed-Why:
Yeah, it's poorly documented, but the piped log child is
also sent SIGUSR1, SIGHUP, and SIGTERM when you send the
respective signals to the parent.  The child needs to handle
them (essentially trap them and clean up properly).

In your case if you just stick an "exec" in front of the grep
I think everything will work just fine.

State-Changed-Why:
It's poorly (or not) documented that the piped log handler
has to handle SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, and SIGTERM.  All three are
shutdown signals.  But if there's a shell involved, as there
is when you do "| rotatelogs" you end up leaving orphans
around... because the shell exits but the child doesn't.

 Dean,
 
     I was actually using a hacked version of rotatelogs--I just
     sent the simple item as an example.
 
     The rotatelogs.c file in the distribution should be updated to
     handle this, or if exec would work for it as well, examples
     of it with the ....Log directive should be updated to show
     the exec.
 
     Because we didn't understand this, we chose not to use piped
     logging in our current release.  With this knowledge, we may
     revisit this issue at a later time,

 thanks very much for the info,
