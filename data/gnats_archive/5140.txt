>Description:
The message "caught SIGTERM, shutting down" and one second later, "resuming
normal operations".
and the message "SIGHUP received, attempting to restart" and one second later,
"configuring--resuming normal operations"
appear in my error_log(.1,2,3) files. No pattern in frequency.  Some at 4:02am
when there is no system activity.
Have checked FAQs and problem report database and could not find this reported.
It may be because this is normal!  I perused source "http_main.c" and do see
HUP and SIG mentioned several times, but I'm not sure if this is for debugging
purposes or it is normal for maintaining parent/child relationships.  
Question:
Do I need to worry about these errors...are they caused by an event or a person?

Thank you for your support!

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... well, that means that something is sending a SIGHUP
or SIGTERM to Apache.  You probably have some log rotation
script running or something (you may not know about it, it
may be a redhat thing) that does this.
