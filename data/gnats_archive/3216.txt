I have looked and tried to figure how to block on a host basis. I can deny from .domain.com

but how would deny from hostname.domain.com
I have tried .hostname.domain.com
I have tried hostname

Can this be done.

Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
This is discussed quite clearly in the docs.  If you
want to block from host "foo.bar.com" use "deny from foo.bar.com"
Regardless, this is not the appropriate forum for this sort
basic support question, please try the listed alternatives
such as Usenet.

 What happens if you do a "nslookup ip" from your server, where IP is the
 name of the host connecting?
 
 What happens if you do "nslookup name" where name is the name that the
 first nslookup gave you?
 
 Is this host in the same domain as your server?
