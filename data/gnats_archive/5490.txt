>Description:

Hello.  This error is a repeat of the PR#463 but occurred in Apache 1.3.9
using either gcc or cc.

The problem, like PR#463, seems to be related to typing.  In
/usr/include/in/netstd.h I have:

#ifndef _KERNEL
#define      INADDR_NONE             0xffffffff       /* -1 return */
#endif

If I create a test program and compile via either cc or gcc the failure
of inet_addr() does not match INADDR_NONE.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

int main( void )
{
    char *w = "entersomedomainhere";
    struct hostent *hep;
    unsigned long my_addr;
    char *p;

    hep = gethostbyname(w);

    if ((!hep) || (hep->h_addrtype != AF_INET || !hep->h_addr_list[0])) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Cannot resolve host name %s --- exiting!\n", w);
        exit(1);
    }

    my_addr = inet_addr( w );

    printf( "Name = %s\n", hep->h_name );
    printf( "inet_addr (unsigned) = %u\n", my_addr );
    printf( "inet_addr (decimal) = %d\n", my_addr );
    printf( "No address (unsigned) = %u\n", INADDR_NONE );
    printf( "No address (decimal) = %d\n", ((unsigned long) -1) );
    printf( "UL:  %d != %d ? %d\n", my_addr, INADDR_NONE,
      (my_addr != INADDR_NONE) );
}

I get:

Name = entersomedomainhere
inet_addr (unsigned) = 4294967295
inet_addr (decimal) = -1
No address (unsigned) = 4294967295
No address (decimal) = -1
UL:  -1 != -1 ? 1

>How-To-Repeat:
If necessary I can provide a short term shell account.
>Fix:
I was able to resolve the problem by #undef'ing INADDR_NONE and letting the
existing #define with http_vhost.c take effect.  Admittedly one should not
have to do so but it patched the problem.  Maybe a test of the sizeof the
return value of inet_addr() and the sizeof INADDR_NONE if compiled on an
alpha when httpd starts?  It would at least let alpha users know there's a
problem.

State-Changed-Why:
Could you provide the output from src/helpers/GuessOS? It
does look like the "fix" is to make sure alpha/OSF uses the
(unsigned long)-1 format, but I want to have that happen
only with your platform (ie: OSF on the alpha)
