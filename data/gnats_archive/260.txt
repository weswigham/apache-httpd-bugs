>Description:
The following

ProxyRequest On
ProxyRemote * http:145.66.48.162
ProxyPass /telegraaf/ proxy:http://www.telegraaf.nl/

always passes /telegraaf/ to proxy 145.66.48.162 as /telegraaf/, while it should
pass: http://www.telegraaf.nl/

The same holds for the following config:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteLog logs/rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 3
RewriteRole ^\/telegraaf\/(.*) http://www.telegraaf.nl/ [proxy]

The file rewrite_log shows great output:

...rewrite /telegraaf/ -> proxy:http://www.telegraaf.nl
...go-ahead with proxy request proxy:http://www.telegreef.nl/ [OK]

Yet, the proxy is asked for /telegraaf/ again.
