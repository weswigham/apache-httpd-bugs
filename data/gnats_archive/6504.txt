>Environment:
W98SE. Running the vanilla Win32 binary d/l from Apache.org. The only conf change was "ServerName lrsapache" and (recently) "LogLevel debug".

Note - "lrsapache" (lrs=my initials) was used, but I don't have a permanent IP address. I have a cable modem, but my ISP issues me a 3-day TCP/IP lease, and may change the IP address at any time.
>Description:
From my original posting to comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows:

I've written a CGI program using Visual Basic, compiled into an .exe file.

The program works fine under PWS4 (W98SE), but fails totally under Apache 1.3.12.

I've tracked it down to the fact that when I issue the GetStdHandle() Win32
API call from my VB program to get a handle for stdout, I get back -1,
rather than a valid handle. Hence all my attempts to write to stdout fail,
and Apache rightfully complains.
>How-To-Repeat:
As noted above, I don't have a permanent IP address. However, I'm quite willing to send you the source for the VB program, upon request.
>Fix:
Not a one!

State-Changed-Why:
There are aparent problems if NULL is passed as the
handle of unused standard channels in the CreateProcess()
call under Win95.  This needs research (that I'm unable
to do without reloading my Win95 config) so I've reclassed
the report as analized until further research and fixes
can be put in place.

Note that the Apache child process is suffering from this
same side-effect under 9x.

State-Changed-Why:

Over the next week, a new version 1.3.15 will roll out the
door.  This version opens the NUL device for output from
the client, so the application executed by cgi should have
all the usual handles.  Please test with the new release.
Note, also, that the Apache process now executes the cgi
in it's (hidden) console, so there should be no nasty
interactions due to the missing console.
