RedHat Linux 6.0
Blackdown JDK 1.2 (even tried with JDk1.17v3, same problem)
openSSL 0.9.4
Ben SSL patch 1.37
>Description:
Everything works just fine without SSL. I installed purely new package with openSSL 0.9.4 and Ben SSL patch 1.37, Apache 1.3.9 and JServ 1.1b2. Everything started OK but when I tried to access a servlet (Hello), it said that "
[Fri Oct 22 03:00:42 1999] [notice] child pid 2639 exit signal Segmentation faul
t (11)
[Fri Oct 22 03:00:43 1999] [notice] child pid 2640 exit signal Segmentation faul
t (11)

I have tried everything and now stuck completely and tired.
Thanks in advanced,
Steve
