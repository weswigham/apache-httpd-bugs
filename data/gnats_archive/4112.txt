>Description:
The documentation is very unclear for the ProxyBlock
directive.  What apache really does is search for
keywords in the SITE part of a URL.  The docs make it unclear that
only the site name part of a url is really searched for matches.			

The following still isn't great but is a possible way to say it:

HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP document requests to sites whose names contain 
matched words, hosts or domains are blocked by the proxy
server.
