SunOS 4.1.4, GCC 2.7.2
All versions of Apache 1.2 Beta, compiled with bundled mod_fastcgi
>Description:
When a FastCGI application is set up in an authentication-controlled space which
uses the Satisfy directive, the server sends a 401 code even when access should
be allowed.

Tis has stopped my migration to 1.2.  The problem manifests in all beta versions
of 1.2.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have also published this info at URL:
http://www.fastcgi.com/mail-archive/0460.html

If I try something like:

Alias /fcgi-bin/ /usr/local/httpd/fcgi-bin/
<Location /fcgi-bin/tiny-perl-fcgi>
  ForceType fastcgi-script
</Location>

... AppClass for tiny-perl-fcgi goes in here...

<Directory /usr/local/httpd/fcgi-bin>
  AuthType Basic
  Satisfy Any
  AuthName foobar
  order deny,allow
  deny from all
  allow from .mycompany.com
  AuthUserFile /usr/local/httpd/htpasswd
  require valid-user
</Directory>

THEN:
accessing /fcgi-bin/tiny-perl-fcgi is responded to with a request for 
authentication, even within the same domain.  Accessing other (non FCGI) files
under /fcgi-bin are not challenged.  Only the FCGI app is incorrectly restricted.

State-Changed-Why:
Looks to be likely fgci doing something wrong; since fgci
isn't maintained by the Apache group (and won't be included
in the next release), if the problem still exists you should
contact the Authors.  Please resubmit if it turns out to
be a bug in the Apache code itself.
