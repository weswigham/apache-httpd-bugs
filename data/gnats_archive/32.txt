>Release:        1.2b1
>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.3 and SunOS 4.1.4 on the Sun4m architecture
gcc 2.5.8 and 2.7.2
>Description:
# ./Configure
Using 'Configuration' as config file
 + configured for SunOS 4 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
# make
gcc -c   -O2 -DSUNOS4   alloc.c
In file included from alloc.c:61:
conf.h:438: regex.h: No such file or directory
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `alloc.o'

The line in question looks like it's the same no matter
the architecture(?):

#include <regex/regex.h>

I change this to:

#include "regex/regex.h"

and it gets past it, until:

gcc -c   -O2 -DSUNOS4   mod_include.c
mod_include.c:72: regex.h: No such file or directory
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `mod_include.o'

Tried running make in the regex subdirectory with the following
command line:
  make CC=gcc AUX_CFLAGS="-O2 -DSUNOS4" RANLIB=ranlib
but produced this error:

gcc -I. -DPOSIX_MISTAKE -O2 -DSUNOS4  regcomp.o regexec.o regerror.o regfree.o split.o debug.o main.o  -o re
collect2: ld returned 2 exit status
ld: Undefined symbol 
   _memmove 
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `re'

Solution in PR 33.  The change to conf.h was not necessary and
should be undone before recompiling.
