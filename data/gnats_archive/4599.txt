>Description:
First Hi :^)

Well, I have an apache 1.3.6 server running with mod_ssl and mod_php3 
loaded dinamically. 

Now it's running OK, but I had to include the following lines on httpd.conf :

AddModule mod_ssl.c
AddModule mod_php3.c

LoadModule ssl_module         libexec/libssl.so
LoadModule php3_module         libexec/libphp3.so

AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3

Isn't it a mistake ? I mean, the LoadModule directive loads 
dinamically the module, but why it's necessary the AddModule 
directive too ? It was supposed to work only with the LoadModule
directive, right ?

Take a look on the output of the http -l command :

Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_so.c
  mod_setenvif.c

There is nothing about mod_php3.c and mod_ssl.c because they 
are dynamically loaded.

But it only works with both the AddModule and LoadModule directive.

Bye and regards

>Fix:
I think that the apxs command can handle this.

State-Changed-Why:
If you look in the config file after all the LoadModule commands,
there is a ClearModuleList directive.  This directive removes
all of the Loaded modules from the list of active modules.
This is done, so that the modules can be re-ordered (remember,
module order does matter).  Without the ClearModuleList, ALL
of your statically linked modules would come before the dynamically
loaded ones.  The AddModule directive then adds modules back
to the active list, from the list of modules loaded into the
server.  This is how the server was designed, and more inforation
can be found by looking at the ClearModuleList directive in the
documentation
