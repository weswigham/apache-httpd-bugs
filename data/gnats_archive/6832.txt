>Description:
I am serving wml for wap phones with an Apache/Jserv server. When using a Nokia 7110, at the first connection, I get the following line in my logfile :

192.168.xxx.xxx - - [11/Nov/2000:09:37:08 +0400] "GET /servlet/homepage?msisdn=9745000008 HTTP/1.1 200 701 "-" "Nokia7110/1.0 (04.77)"

I can't find what means the 200 701 code... On the next connection, i will get a 200 411 return code, which is normal...

Have you got an idea ?

Thanks for your support

Guillaume

State-Changed-Why:

I don't think you are giving an EXACT quote of your log
file, but it appears that what you are seeing is the
HTTP response status code (200=OK), followed by
the number of bytes transfered.  I don't see anything
wrong with that.
Thanks for using Apache.
