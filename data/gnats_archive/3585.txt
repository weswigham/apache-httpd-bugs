 Believe this is a bit of a snap decision. I have been running the Proxy
 server for sometime. So far, this is the first system that someone was not
 able to login. It could be localized to this single server's implementation
 of Apache. The sysadmin of the this system is relatively new and the Apache
 version running is not the most current. I am attempting to find a common
 ground to fix this problem.
 
 Your reply does not state if there have been other reports of this problem
 to support to conclusion that it is "bugs in the MS proxy software".
 
 Your support and assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

 No I don't know of any problems/bugs regarding www authentication, but
 you said that authentication succeeds if you bypass the proxy...
 Well, basic www authentication is a simple mechanism: the server
 informs the client with a special http header that authentication is
 needed and the client requests the page again and includes an extra http
 header with the password. The proxy only needs to forward the messages,
 but if authentication fails with the MS proxy and works without the proxy
 I'm tempted to conclude that this is some kind of bug in the MS proxy.
 
 Since I cannot find an indication in your report that this is a bug in
 Apache I recommend that you either contact Microsoft or ask in a more
 appropriate forum (e.g. Usenet).
 
 
 Regards...
