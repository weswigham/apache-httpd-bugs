>Description:
I'd like to be able to retrieve the value of a cookie that I set.

The cookie is set on redirection to a no-access page which contains terms of use, upon agreeing a second cookie is set.
Mod_Rewrite is supposed to check for the existance of this second cookie when it allows unrestricted access to my site.
The access cookie is set on a second page, the first page has set the origional url request in a cookie that should be accessable to use as a link target in the access granted page.

It would also be useful to me if I didn't have to use a regex expression to test for the access cookie.  I think that an optimised output matched against the desired value would be faster and less resource intensive.
>How-To-Repeat:
This is unknown to me as it is in the construction of the pages and not the output its self.

"Maybe look for a way to allow modules to expose variables for logging? I.e. "%(mod_cookie:cookie)m""

HTTP_COOKIE:CookieName Should report the cookie's value.  There should also be ways of accessing other cookie data such as expire time.  Such syntax is not readily aparant to me.
