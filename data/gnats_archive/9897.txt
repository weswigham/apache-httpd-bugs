Suse 7.1
Apache 1.3.19 installed by Suse
>Description:
Hallo,

I will install Apache 1.3.23. Apache 1.3.19 is installed by Suse 7.1. My Problem is, that the Makefile is empty after ./configure --prefix=...
I think the Problem is:
sed: -e expression #44, char 35: Unknown option to `s'
I have install another Version of SED, but the same mistake.


escom:/usr/local/src/lamp/apache_1.3.23/apache_1.3.23 # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache/1.3.23 --datadir=/var/www --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max
