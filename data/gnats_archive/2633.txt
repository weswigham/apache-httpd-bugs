I think it would be nice to state that the Include-files can be nested 
ON CONDITION that the included file is a .shtml-file too.  
This is nowhere mentioned, and could cause a bit of frustration, 
especially since the docs state "Thus include files can be nested".  
The text "the output the server would return if the URL were accessed 
by the client is included in the parsed output"

Erm... I'm afraid I don't understand your concern.  Includes
can be nested and the docs say they can, so what is the problem?

 That's correct, but I interpreted it as thought the text is included and
 then reparsed, but actually, the text to be included is retrieved, and
 then included into the original test.
 This way nesting can only be done using nested shtml files
 while I thought it would be done with any file
 e.g.
 f1.shtml:
 hi
 <!--#include virtual="./f2.txt" -->
 hi again
 
 f2.txt
 ho
 <!--#fsize virtual="./f1.shtml" -->
 hoho
 
 will output:
 hi
 ho
 <!--#fsize virtual="./f1.shtml" -->
 hoho
 hi again
 
 while if you rename f2.txt onto f2.shtml (and also in the
 include-statement in f1.shtml, you will get:
 hi
 ho
 1k
 hoho
 hi again
 
 So I'd clarify that parsing of the to be included file is done (when
 allowed so when an shtml-file) before including.  The text states this but
 not specifically that the to be included file should be an shtml file.
 After I discovered this difference, I understood the statement fully, but
 actually some ennerving time too late for me 
 The output the server would return will not be parsed if it weren't an
 shtml file.
 Now I come to think of it, I don't know if I wasn't just not-enough
 allertive.
