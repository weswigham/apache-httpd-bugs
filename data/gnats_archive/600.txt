>Description:
We are using SSI for including our standard headers and footers (which don't change often) into our webpages.
(but we don't use executable SSI at all).

In our srm.conf there is the following entry:
	AddHandler server-parsed .html

Which causes "Last Modified: Unknown" for all *.html documents.

As webmaster (apache_1.2b6) and cache manager (squid 1.1.8) I'm interested
in an optimal co-operation between WWW servers and caching proxies.

Is it possible to use the smallest file-date value of all files used
for a (NoExec-) SSI-webpage instead of "Unknown"?

Ernst

PS. I know about the XBitHack - it is a hack! (in my Opinion).

State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately it's not at all easy to do this in one pass
over the input files... especially because the headers have
been sent before any of the input files are processed.  Changing
that behaviour can be quite expensive... there are possibilities
that have been tossed around.  But nothing has been coded up
yet.

Thanks for using Apache!
