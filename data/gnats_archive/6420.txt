The problem is patch can not process the SSLpatch file.  It can not find the source files to patch.  Please, give me the email address of somebody who has actually implemented Apache with SSL on NT.  Otherwise, I have not choice but scrap the free Apache and go with one of the expensive packages like Fastrack($300) or IIS.  Both of which I have already implemented on other projects.

 Which versions of SSL are enabled? See below about a known
 bug with Microsoft SSL handling. Not sure what your problem
 with the patch itself is. Actually.. you might not even need them.
 
 > somebody who has actually implemented Apache with SSL on NT?
 
 Frank Martini of Cadence Development is running SSL with Apache
 under Windows NT just fine. ( Again, see below ) .
 
 You are service pack 6a so that might have something to do with it. 
 Try backing off to SP 3 or 4 and limit SSL to SSLv2 and see it that does it 
 for you. You might not actually need the SSL patches at all.
 
 Here is Frank Martini's successful SSL/Apache platform...
 He is using the EXACT same versions of both Apache and
 OpenSSL that you are.

 It concerns the 'bugginess' of SSL under Win32 when using Apache
 and mod_ssl. I believe there are some PR's about this. 
 
 The problem is NOT with Apache.
 
 Workaround seems to be limiting SSL to SSLv2.

State-Changed-Why:
Opening a bug report is not the right way to get assistance
with getting SSL working under apache. I'll give you a 
couple of hints though...

1. Try setting POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 in your environment variables. Search google.com for POSIXLY_CORRECT to get
details.

2. Use the patch option to ignore whitespace. CRs and LFs
cause no end of headaches when patching Win32 sources with
patch files generated on Unix systems.
before you run patch.
