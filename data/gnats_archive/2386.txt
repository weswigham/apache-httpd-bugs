SunOS us1.usit.net 5.6 Generic_105181-04 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2

Would be happy to provide output from showrev -p and netstat (both lengthy) if
it would be of any help.
>Description:
Machine has multiple physical ethernets, ~ 760 IP addresses, hundreds of
VirtualHosts running under a few instances of Apache 1.2.x.

Switched one server, a standalone (no VirtualHosts) to 1.3.0 and within hours
all servers on the machine seem to have stopped responding.  A netstat -na shows
many connections stuck in CLOSE_WAIT on the IP of the newly upgraded server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unknown, possibly more brokenness in Solaris? (Sun says 2.6 has fixed everything,
but... ;-)
>Fix:
Have a test machine available to try to duplicate this, will try to do so.

 Were you running 1.2.6 before?  There were some changes during the 1.2.x
 series that may be relevant... and if you're not running 1.2.6 it would be
 nice to know if that works.

 Currently it's running 1.2.5.  I will up it to 1.2.6 today and see if the
 behaviour changes (I know I should have done this already :P).

 The production server has been running 1.2.6 fine for 2 hours now, which is
 about how long it took for 1.3.0 to stop working yesterday.
 
 What else can I do to help?

 Time for wild guesses.
 
 First thing to try:  add EXTRAC_FLAGS=-DLARGE_WRITE_THRESHOLD=8194
 (recompile, install, test)
 
 Next thing to try:  Remove the USE_MMAP_FILES definition from the solaris
 section of include/conf.h.
 
 Try each separately please... thanks :)

 Erm, make that "EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DLARGE_WRITE_THRESHOLD=8194".

 Same result after about 30 minutes of uptime.

 Haven't tried this last suggestion.
 
 Unfortunately I cannot continue to experiment with a production server, and
 so far am unable to duplicate any problems on our test machine.  I will 
 continue to pursue this on our test machine in my spare time.

 You may also want to try solaris specific newsgroups to see if anyone else
 is running into it.

 BTW... a standard question I forgot to ask:  Is your ServerRoot on NFS?
 If so you need to use the LockFile directive to move the lock file.

 No, ServerRoot is local, but all content is on NFS.  All logfiles, pidfiles,
 conf files, etc. are local.

 If you look at /server-status what state does it show the children in?
 
 If a lot of the children appear to be stuck doing something, find the pid
 of one of them and then run "truss" against it... and send some output
 back so we can figure out where it's at.
 
 Oh yeah, another thing to try is to put "LogLevel debug" into your
 httpd.conf and see if any useful messages are printed in your error_log.

 Unfortunately the server is completely non-responsive when this happens.

 Will try that, I'm still trying to get the problem to occur on any machine
 other than our production web server. :P

 I think I owe you all an apology.  Following the most recent round of
 patches to the affected machine, 1.3.0 seems to be doing fine there.
 Suffice to say it pays to keep up with the latest patch reports from Sun.
