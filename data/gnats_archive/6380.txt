>Description:
Our PC's running NT4sp6a or 2000 pro accessing our servlets will hang our servers. We can still access static HTML pages but no servlet will run.
Our log files are showing...
"Premature end of script headers: /servlet/servlet_name" and nothing else. A graceful restart of Apache fixes the problem.
