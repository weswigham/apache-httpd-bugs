>Description:
i noticed that the actual removal of env vars does not occur if the
"UnsetEnv" directive is in the main body of the httpd.conf

moving the directive within a <Directory> group seemed to work.

also, the reason for my debugging was to find out why UnsetEnv did not appear
to unset environment variables for my php scripts.

it appears that "3rd party" extensions may need an actual unsetenv() call to
remove the item from the environment.
>How-To-Repeat:
with an apache/php install, use the output of phpinfo(); to check if env vars were properly deleted.

with the following debug statements in src/modules/standard/mod_env.c:

static void *merge_env_dir_configs(pool *p, void *basev, void *addv)
...
    while (uenv[0] != '\0') {
        ap_table_unset(new_table, uenv);
ap_log_error(__FILE__, __LINE__, 9, NULL, "%s:%d UnsetEnv %s\n", __FILE__, __L
INE__, uenv);
        uenv = ap_getword_conf(p, &unset);
    }

and:

static const char *add_env_module_vars_unset(cmd_parms *cmd,
                         env_dir_config_rec *sconf,
                                             char *arg)
{
ap_log_error(__FILE__, __LINE__, 9, NULL, "%s:%d UnsetEnv %s\n", __FILE__, __L
INE__, arg);

i noticed that the actual removal of env vars does not occur if the
"UnsetEnv" directive is in the main body of the httpd.conf

moving the directive within a <Directory> group seemed to work.

>Fix:
it appears that "3rd party" extensions may need an actual unsetenv() call to
remove the item from the environment.

my patch was to do:
static void *merge_env_dir_configs(pool *p, void *basev, void *addv)
...
    while (uenv[0] != '\0') {
        ap_table_unset(new_table, uenv);
        unsetenv(uenv);
        uenv = ap_getword_conf(p, &unset);
    }
