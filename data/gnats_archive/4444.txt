>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, Sun Workshop CC Compiler, full patches. Also happens on
2.7. All are on SPARC processors, plenty of memory.
>Description:
When accessing pages protected with mod_auth (either via a configuration
in httpd.conf or a .htaccess file), sometimes Apache will get in an odd
state and just loop. This is manifested by the bottom status line of the
browser (Netscape 4.0 - 4.5) repeatedly flashing "Contacting host ...
Host contacted ... Contacting host" very fast. The error_log won't show
anything, but the access_log will just show repeated GET entries for the
requested URL. At no point does a password dialog box pop up or the page
ever actually get downloaded to the browser.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, the hosts are behind a firewall. However, I have been able to 
narrow it down a little. I believe it only happens on relative hostnames. If
you give the full address (for ex, host.dom.foo.com) in the browser it seems
to work just fine. However, if you give a relative name (for ex, host.dom),
it will get into a loop sometimes. Note that the behavior is intermittent.
Restarting the httpd daemon fixes the problem 100% of the time.

No, sorry. :-(

 Hi-
 
 Sorry to bother you, I hadn't heard anything back on this. I just spoke
 to people at a different site and I managed to get a reproducible account
 which you guys can test:

 The more I looked at it, this appeared to be the case for me as well.
 It does not matter whether or not you use fully-qualified hostnames
 or not (as I originally stated), but rather which you use _first_.
 For example, if you access one of the internal sites I manage at
 sdhelp.west then re-access it at sdhelp.west.sun.com, the server will
 loop. The same thing happens if you do it in the reverse; it seems
 reaching a directory with two different hostnames confuses the server
 and it just loops. I have not experienced it trying to authenticate
 users twice in these situations, but it sounds related.
 
 If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know. I will try
 to take a look at the source when I have time but unfortunately do
 not know Apache as well as you (obviously). Note that re-reading the
 database reports it seems this could be related to `mod_auth-any/4399'.
 
 Thanks again for your help.
