>Description:
I have a user directory which contains a .htaccess file that
restricts access to a certain host (deny from all, allow from thehost).
When this directory is accessed via "http://host/~username/abc" the
access restrictions are obeyed.  If I set up a ProxyPass that allows
getting to the same directory via "http://host/abc" (as in
ProxyPass /abc http://host/~username/abc) the access restriction is
not enforced when the access is via "http://host/abc".  At the same
time, "http://host/~username/abc" still enforces the restriction.
