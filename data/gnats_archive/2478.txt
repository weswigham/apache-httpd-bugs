>Description:
I have confirmed that mod_rewrite was compiled into my httpd exec by looking into my build output.  Following is in the httpd.conf:
#
NameVirtualHost x.x.x.x
#
...
#
<VirtualHost x.x.x.x>
ServerName users.mydomain.dom
DocumentRoot /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/users/
ErrorLog logs/users-error_log
TransferLog logs/users-access_log
RewriteLog logs/users-rewrite_log
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/$ /index.html [L]
RewriteRule ^/([^/]+)/?(.*)$ http://www.mydomain.dom/~$1/$2 [R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>
#
#

Upon execing httpd, I get the following error in the error log, and Apache fails to start.

[Sat Jun 20 20:34:02 1998] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
Syntax error on line 265 of /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'RewriteLog', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not inc
luded in the server configuration

NOTE:  This worked flawlessly in 1.2.6
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile mod_rewrite in Apache, create a virtualhost with rewrite rules as above.

N/A

 Hi.
 I've been unable to reproduce the behaviour described in your bug
 report to apache, not even with the example configuration in your
 message. Maybe mod_rewrite has been compiled as a dynamic shared
 object but you haven't put into your server configuration the
 directive (LoadModule) needed to insert it into the running
 daemon (this could happen if you are using with apache 1.3.0
 the same configuration you used with 1.2.X). You might try to
 execute "httpd -l" and check if "mod_rewrite.c" appears in the
 list of compiled in modules.
 Thanks for your bug report and for using apache.
 Regards.
