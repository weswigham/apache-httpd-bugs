>Environment:
Windows 2000, sp2; VC++ 6.0
>Description:
Apache crashes when an isapi exention dll uses WriteClient. This is because of a forgotten dereferencing of pointer variable carrying the length of the data stream to be written.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use WriteClient in an Isapi-Extension dll e.g. IIS-Sample "Simple" included in Plattform SDK Samples (Plattform SDK\samples\web\iis\isapi\extension\simple). 
>Fix:
in

WriteClient (HCONN ConnID, LPVOID Buffer, LPDWORD lpwdwBytes,
                         DWORD dwReserved)
{
...
    b = apr_bucket_transient_create(Buffer, (apr_size_t)lpwdwBytes);

dereferencing of pointer was forgotten, so should be

    b = apr_bucket_transient_create(Buffer, (apr_size_t)(*lpwdwBytes));
