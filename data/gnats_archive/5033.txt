>Description:
the following code in mod_cgi:

       if (!ap_can_exec(&r->finfo))
           return log_scripterror(r, conf, FORBIDDEN, APLOG_NOERRNO,
                                  "file permissions deny server execution");
     }

only checks Unix mode bits to determine whether or not Apache has
permission to execute the CGI. On any filesystem that supports
ACL's, if Apache does have execute permission via an ACL, but not via
the Unix mode bits, it will fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
<NA>
>Fix:
I propose the following change:

        if(access(r->filename, X_OK)) {
          if (errno == EACCES)
            return log_scripterror(r, conf, FORBIDDEN, APLOG_NOERRNO,
                                   "file permissions deny server execution");
          else
          return log_scripterror(r, conf, SERVER_ERROR, APLOG_NOERRNO,
                                 "system error checking execute access");
        }

the POSIX standard access() call will take into account both Unix
mode bits and ACL's when checking for execute permission.
