>Description:
I tried to install mod_perl with apache and I encountered many problems to do so.
I finally succeeded. The fix I needed:

(1) mod_perl looks for ../apaci but ../../apaci only exists.
    fix: I added a symlink in src/modules/apaci -> ../apaci

(2) when compiling local headers require a -DMOD_PERL to be found, but
    this macro was not defined. I added ' echo -DMOD_PERL' to apaci.

(3) When linking, the perl library and dynamic loader was missing.
    I fixed MODULES definition in src/Makefile to add these 2 perl libs.

(4) When apache is built by mod_perl, 'make install' does not install
    httpd and other specific apache files. One must go to the apache
    tree and install it from there.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to install mod_perl on my system.
>Fix:
Yes, fix the installation procedure.
