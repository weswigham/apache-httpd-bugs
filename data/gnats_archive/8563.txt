Windows 2000, sp2; VC++ 6.0
>Description:
Apache crashes when an isapi exention dll that exports the cleanup method TerminateExtension is precached by means of ISAPICacheFile statement in the config-file. This is because Apache read and executes the config file twice. When cleaning up the isapi-dll is first unloaded and than Apache tries to execute TerminateExtension, which clearly fails.
>How-To-Repeat:
Precache an Isapi-Extension dll e.g. IIS-Sample "Simple" included in Plattform SDK Samples (Plattform SDK\samples\web\iis\isapi\extension\simple). 

In httpd.conf:
AddHandler isapi-isa .dll
ISAPICacheFile C:\Apache2.0\cgi-bin\simple.dll


>Fix:
the cleanup handlers (dll unload / TerminateExtension) for isapi-dll should be inserted in different order in the cleanup list und therefore executed in different order
