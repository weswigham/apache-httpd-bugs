>Environment:
Apache 1.3b6 precompiled from apache.org, Win95OSR2, 64Megs RAM
>Description:
Would like to see a LimitConnect directive (or something similar)
that would limit the number of concurrent connections from one IP
or host. Would like to see it work inside a <Directory> directive.

Such as:
<directory c:/apache/htdocs/photographers/freephotos/>
LimitConnect 2
</directory>

This would limit the user to (2) concurrent connections in
that directory, this restricting them from downloading 
more than 2 binaries (Assuming that indexing is on... Etc.).

Also with that, the ability to give a custom error message
when limit is exceeded.

# TOO MANY CONCURRENT CONNECTIONS
ErrorDocument ??? /errormsg/???.htm

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, a lot of folks would like this.  It's very difficult to
implement in the current server.

It also screws up proxies, which quite validly make multiple
connections.

Comment-Added:

There is a patch which implements this in our "contrib" 
directory.  It's not officially supported by the Apache 
developers, nor is there any guarantee of quality or 
speed or even that it'll compile cleanly against 1.3.  
You can get it at

  http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/patches/1.3/limitipconn.patch

Enjoy.
