>Description:
I find strange that httpd stops when you dynamically change something in the access.conf file.

Dangerous for a working machine !
>How-To-Repeat:
In the main directory section in access.conf:
order allow;deny
rather than
order allow,deny
>Fix:
Yeah! Just prompt for error, not quit!
Thank you

State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 26 04:24:49 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:

If your configuration file has errors in it when you
issue a restart then your parent will not restart,
it will exit with an error.
If the shell from which you issued the restart is not
the shell from which you started Apache you won't see
any error message. This is normal behaviour and cannot
be changed.
See http://www.apache.org/docs/stopping.html for details.
