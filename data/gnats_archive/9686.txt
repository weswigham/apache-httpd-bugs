>Description:
The perl script used to generate an ndbm file listed as an example at mod_rewrite documentation page does not treat comment and 'all space' correctly lines due to the fact that the s metacharacter is not escaped

the use of dbmopen is deprecated

dbmopen does not regenerate all records, creating an "always append" condition
>How-To-Repeat:
look at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html
right after the RewriteMap directive
>Fix:

#!/path/to/bin/perl
##
##  txt2dbm -- convert txt map to dbm format
##

use NDBM_File;
use Fcntl;


($txtmap, $dbmmap) = @ARGV;
open(TXT, "<$txtmap");
tie (%DB, 'NDBM_File', $dbmmap,O_RDWR|O_TRUNC|O_CREAT, 0644);
while (<TXT>) {
    next if (m|^\s*#.*| or m|^\s*$|);
    $DB{$1} = $2 if (m|^\s*(\S+)\s+(\S+)$|);
}
untie %DB;
close(TXT)
