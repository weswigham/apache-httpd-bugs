State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Sep 22 09:52:37 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
You need to have the appropriate #! line as the first line
of your script, and install Apache in a path without spaces.

The spaces problem will be fixed in 1.3.2 which will be available
shortly.
