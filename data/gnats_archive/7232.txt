>Description:
Using FilesMatch like this  <FilesMatch .*\.htm$> should match any file that ends with an .htm , but it doesn't. If the file has an space or any special caracter it does not match it. 

Even if you put <FilesMatch \.htm$> it does not work. 
>How-To-Repeat:
www.foo.com/foo.htm  will be matched
www.foo.com/foo bar.htm will not be matched

Sorry.. no clue.

State-Changed-When: Mon Feb 12 13:14:48 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Unencoded spaces are not allowed in URLs.  One guess at what
you are seeing is that the browser is sending an 
unencoded space in the GET request, and Apache is treating
everything after the space as part of the HTTP version
rather than part of the filename.  This could mean
that you are not really requesting the file you thought
you were requesting.

If you can confirm that this is not your problem,
and that Apache really is allowing <FilesMatch> sections
to be bypassed, please let us know.

Thanks for using Apache!

 There are too many variables here to properly diagnose what is going on.
 A request for "x x.htm" could easily be interpreted by Apache as a request
 for "x" which could (via MutiViews) lead to "x.htm" being served, and
 then who knows what your Perl handler would do with that.
 
 To confirm to myself that <FilesMatch> does work with encoded space,
 I tried a more simple configuration:
 
 <FilesMatch .*\.htm$>
 Deny from all
 </FilesMatch>
 
 And that worked fine regardless of whether the request contained an
 encoded space or not.  Why don't you try something like, with filenames
 "x.htm" and "y y.htm" (requested as "y%20y.htm") and see if it works for
 you (ie. it forbids access).
 
 If it does work, then there is likely a problem either with the way you
 are calling the Perl handler, or with the Perl handler itself.
 
 Good luck.
 
 Joshua.
