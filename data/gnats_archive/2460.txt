>Description:
This could be only a documentation bug, but the TimeOut directive's
description doesn't mention that the timer also applies to the amount of
time that the server will wait in between output from CGI scripts.
I have some CGI scripts that can take a very long time, so I would
prefer a separate directive for that timer (the http server written by
Dave Kristol has one) but I think at least the documentation on www.apache.org
should list this as a fourth thing that the TimeOut directive applies to.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a CGI script that sleeps for 40 seconds with a server running with
a TimeOut of 20.
