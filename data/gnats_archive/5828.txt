>Description:
The CGI script that I am running cannot access both the PATH_INFO and the QUERY_STRING at the same time.  This is an issue in the following simple proxy script.  If this is the URL: 
http://visible.host.co.za/cgi-bin/nph-proxy1.cgi/path/on-hidden.asp?var1=val123

Then the QUERY_STRING should be var1=val123 but it isn't set.

Here is the script, which works on Netscape Enterprise Server 3.6.2

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Socket;
my ($server, $sn, $sc, $rm, $ct, $cl, $rq, $qs, $buf, $dummy, @addrs, $remote,$port, $iaddr, $paddr, $proto, $line);
my ($co, $len, $data);

$server = "hidden.host.co.za";
$port = 80;
$proto   = getprotobyname('tcp');


$sn = $ENV{"SERVER_NAME"};
$sc = $ENV{"SCRIPT_NAME"};
$rm = $ENV{"REQUEST_METHOD"};
$ct = $ENV{"CONTENT_TYPE"};
$cl = $ENV{"CONTENT_LENGTH"};
$rq = $ENV{"PATH_INFO"};
$qs = $ENV{"QUERY_STRING"};
if (not $qs eq "") { $rq = "${rq}?${qs}"; }
$buf = "${rm} $rq HTTP/1.0\r\n";
$buf = "${buf}Host: ${sn}${sc}\r\n";
if (not $ct eq "") { $buf = "${buf}Content-type: ${ct}\r\n"; }
if (not $cl eq "") { $buf = "${buf}Content-length: ${cl}\r\n"; }
$buf = "${buf}\r\n";
if (not $cl eq "") { read(STDIN,$co,$cl); $buf = "${buf}${co}"; }
if ($server =~ /^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$/) {
   @addrs = pack('C4',split(/\./,$server));
} else {
   ($dummy,$dummy,$dummy,$dummy,@addrs) = gethostbyname($server);
}

$remote  = $server;
if ($port =~ /\D/) { $port = getservbyname($port, 'tcp') }
die "No port" unless $port;
$iaddr   = inet_aton($remote)               || die "no host: $remote";
$paddr   = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);

$proto   = getprotobyname('tcp');
socket(S, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)  || die "socket: $!";
connect(S, $paddr)    || die "connect: $!";

#socket(S,2,2,$proto) || die "socket: $!";
#connect(S,pack("S n a4 x8",2,$port,$addrs[0])) || die "connect: $!";
select(STDOUT) || die "select: $!"; $| = 1;
select(S) || die "select: $!"; $| = 1;
syswrite(S,$buf,length($buf)) || die "syswrite: $!";
while ($len = sysread(S,$data,65536)) { syswrite(STDOUT,$data,$len); }
close(S) || die "close: $!";
>How-To-Repeat:
The description above should give enough info to reproduce the problem.
>Fix:
Set both PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING env variables.

State-Changed-Why:

Firstly, please upgrade to a current version of Apache and
verify that the problem still exists.  Also, do you see
the same behaviour when using a normal (not nph) script?
