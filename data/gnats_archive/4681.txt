>Description:
htpasswd.exe seems to have a limit on password length on the win32 build 1.3.6.
A password of 10 characters seems to fail, but a password of 5 characters works.
Why?

Is it me or is there a password size limit in htpasswd.exe ?
If so, it doesn't tell you in the program!


>How-To-Repeat:
For the 1.3.6 Win32 apache server build, use htpasswd.exe to add a user and for password enter a password such as 'blacktulip' authentication will fail with a password mismatch, change password to 'tulip' and it works.
