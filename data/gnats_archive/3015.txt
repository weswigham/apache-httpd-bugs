 I have found the simple solution for that
 
 invoke the .exe program by a .bat file
 
 sorry for trouble caused.

State-Changed-Why:
I just tried an exe cgi that was not wrapped in a bat
file and it worked great.  Could you please try to reproduce
your error using 1.3.2.  You should not have to wrap C cgi's
in bat files in order to get them to work..At least I can get
exe's to work directly with 1.3.2
Thanks for using Apache

 here is my setting for the handlers
 
 # To use CGI scripts:
 AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
 AddHandler cgi-script .exe
 AddHandler cgi-script .bat
 
 and, the same, if I have the URL as "http://bonso/cgi-bin/a.exe?hihi=lolo"
 return as:
 Internal Server Error
 Premature end of script headers 
 
 but, if I use "http://bonso/cgi-bin/a.bat?hihi=lolo"
 work fine and return:
 hihi
 >>hihi=lolo<< 
 length is: 9 
 
 my script is a C++ program and use GNU compiler
 the program is 
 == start ==
 #include <stdlib.h>
 #include <stdio.h>
 
 void main()
 {       printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");
         printf("<html><body>\n");
         printf("<strong>hihi</strong><br>\n");
 	char *envstr;
 	envstr = getenv("QUERY_STRING");
 	if (envstr == NULL)
 		printf("it is null\n");
 	else	printf(">>%s<<\n",envstr);
 	printf("<br>length is: %d\n",strlen(envstr)); 
        printf("</body></html>\n");
 }
 === end ===
