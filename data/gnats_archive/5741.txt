>Description:
Trying to get Apache running with php (3.0.14) and oracle.  Had to change the compile flag from -Aa to -Ae for php to compile successfully.

I then changed the same compile option in ./src/Configure for apache.  I run configure as follows:

./configure --prefix=/www/apache_1.3.9 --active-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a


When I run make I get the following error:

.
.
.
/usr/lib/dld.sl: Call to mmap() failed - TEXT /product/oracle/7.3.4/lib/libclnts
h.sl
/usr/lib/dld.sl: Permission denied
sh: 8234 Abort(coredump)
*** Error exit code 134

Stop.
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.


I've tried running make as root and oralce and get the same error.  I don't know where to go to from here.
