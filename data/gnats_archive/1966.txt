As in the synopsis. This is insufficient resolution for sites with contractual obligations

It adds a Rule that only turns on if mod_log_config is installed that
changes the %T directive behaviour to log the seconds as %.3fs using gettimeofday
instead of time(0);
If the Rule is not in place, the old behaviour applies.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the patch but it will be left in contrib for now.
Timing things in the server is not really accurate at all for
timing trials.  The server has no idea when all the data has
left its network buffers, and so the times are at best an
approximation... so millisecond resolution isn't really much of
a win.
