Apache version 1.3.12 and PHP 4.0 (latest) are compiled as per the instructions in the document. Apache is set to run in INETD mode.

State-Changed-Why:

Two issues here:

1. inetd mode is not recommended.  Don't use it unless
you have a very good reason to do so, and you really
know what you are doing.

2. Neither bug report has enough information to make
me believe that there is any problem with Apache.
If you really think this is an Apache bug, you should
examine how your application is passing the session
data, and determine what Apache is doing differently
depending on the setting of ServerType.

Thanks for using Apache!
