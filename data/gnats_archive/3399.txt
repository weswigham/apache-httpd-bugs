SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-23 sun4u sparc SUNW, Ultra-Enterprise
>Description:
Once in a while, Apache will stop writing any log files.  

Our server is configured to write a new log file for each 
virtual host for each new day, while the log file for the 
previous day is archived away.

Anyway, once in a while, Apache don't write any log files, 
but it still runs quite happliy, until we discover the
problem and give it a reboot.

Any ideas why Apache does this and how to stop it from doing it
again?
