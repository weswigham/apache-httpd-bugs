Any
>Description:
With the following ruleset

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/keyword/av\ (.*)  http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q\&kl=XX\&stype=stext\&q=$1  [L,R]

the URL is unescaped prior to matching, then the unescaped string is inserted on the right hand side in the query string, e.g. (request and Location: response header log)

"GET http://keyword.netscape.com/keyword/av%20test%20text HTTP/1.0"
redirects to
"http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&stype=stext&q=test text"

>How-To-Repeat:
See above
>Fix:
Escape query string prior to concatinating r->args
