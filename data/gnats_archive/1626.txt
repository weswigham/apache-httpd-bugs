State-Changed-Why:
Yes it solves it as much as it can be solved without rewriting the
code to take into account completely bogus situations.  Perhaps
you need to tune your MaxClient setting so as to avoid swapping.
I certainly haven't seen any problems on a dual pentium pro 166
with 128Mb of RAM.

 This may well be due to you either not applying the patch correctly or not
 properly rebuilding httpd and using the _new_ binary on your server.

Comment-Added:
Ok I take that back, there's a little more we can do without
doing a complete rewrite.  I'll see about fixing it.  The
no2slash() fix was however the majority of the cpu wastage.
