CYGWIN_NT-5.0 protheus 1.3.6(0.47/3/2) 2001-12-08 17:02 i686 unknown
>Description:
child httpds are running too long, they stay in keep-alive state (seen from /server-status) and can not been killed by usuall signals, except SIGTERM. Seens as if the signal passing is somehow not working well under Cygwin 1.x.
>How-To-Repeat:
see http://apache.dev.wapme.net/server-status for the status and http://apache.dev.wapme.net/server-info for the config.

>Fix:
Somehow has to figure out why the childs stay in keep-alive state in the scoreboard and why the signalling seems to break here.
