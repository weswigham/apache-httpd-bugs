JServ SSI v1.0
Probably any Java compiler, any platform.
JDk 1.1.6, uname -a: SunOS lsesun14 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1,
Apache 1.3.4, JServ 1.0b, JServ SSI 1.0.
>Description:
JServ SSI v1.0 throws ClassCastException when the SERVLET tag of the
page it processes refers to a servlet which is not an HttpServlet
(but, let's say, a GenericServlet).

The exception is thrown in JServSSI.java, line 904, in member
    void runServlet(ServletInfo info, ServletContext context,
      HttpServletResponse res)
    throws ServletException, IOException
>How-To-Repeat:
Take an HTML page with a SERVLET tag, change the servlet to be any servlet
extending let's say GenericServlet, load the page and see the exception
in the Page Source window of netscape.
>Fix:
Change JServSSI.java:904 from

  HttpServlet servlet = (HttpServlet)context.getServlet(className);

to

  Servlet servlet = context.getServlet(className);

thus removing the unnecessary cast.
