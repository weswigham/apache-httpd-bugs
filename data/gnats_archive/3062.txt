>Description:
From main/rfc1413.c (line 186):

    if (sscanf(buffer, "%u , %u : USERID :%*[^:]:%512s", &rmt_port, &our_port,

This is "correct syntax" according to RFC1413, but not all ident daemons
respond under recommended syntax of "remote , local". Some (50%) reply with
"remote,local" or "remote, local" syntax.
>How-To-Repeat:
Pipe in "remote,local" and watch sscanf() fail.
>Fix:
Change main/rfc1413.c (line 186) to:
 
    if (sscanf(buffer, "%u%*[^0-9]%u : USERID :%*[^:]:%512s", &rmt_port, &our_port,

Which should (and will) allow for any format. (This is probably not deemed
as a "proper," although it has yet to fail me).

NOTE: Same bug is present in *ALL* versions of tcp-wrappers (which is obviously
where main/rfc1413.c originated from). In the future, please try to refrain
from re-using 4+ (broken) year-old code. Thanks.
