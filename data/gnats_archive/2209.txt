>Description:
When an If-Modified-Since request for a CGI script is processed,
and the I-M-S date matches the Last-Modified date provided by the
script, apache transmits the normal status line as given by the script
(e.g., "200 OK") but doesn't transmit the body.  This causes browsers
to choke with "document contains no data" or the like.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a CGI script that provides a last-modified header like
  Last-Modified: Sun, 04 Jun 1995 17:36:33 GMT
along with a normal document and status "200 OK".
Then send a request like this:
  GET /cgi-bin/testscript HTTP/1.0
  If-Modified-Since: Sun, 04 Jun 1995 17:36:33 GMT

Apache will respond with
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Sun, 10 May 1998 18:50:47 GMT
  Server: Apache/1.3b6
  Connection: close

and no further data.  The correct behavior would be to give a
"304 Not Modified" header.
>Fix:
The following patch takes care of it, and looks right to me.
I haven't worked with this code before, so someone familiar with
the code should sanity-check my fix.

Basically, what's happening is that ap_die is setting the request's status
to 304 but it doesn't change the status_line accordingly.  The fixed version
sets the status_line to NULL so it will be provided automatically by
ap_basic_http_header.

State-Changed-Why:
Weird, I am not seeing this bug with 1.3b7-dev (i.e. the
current CVS tree) and I don't see anything in the recent 
commits since 1.3b6 that would have affected this.  

E.g., try 

http://www.apache.org/~brian/aptest/last-mod.cgi

You'll see it behaves as expected.  If you could pull
down a CVS snapshot from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/
and let me know if the problem still exists for some
reason (I'm on freebsd) I would appreciate it.

 Sorry it's taken me a long time to get back to you.
 
 This problem still exists in 1.3.6, and the patch I provided 
 in PR2209 still works.  To reproduce, install the attached
 script as /cgi/imsbug, then send the following request to
 the server:
 
   GET /cgi-bin/testscript HTTP/1.0
   If-Modified-Since: Sun, 04 Jun 1995 17:36:33 GMT
 
 Apache will respond with
 
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
   Date: Sun, 20 Jun 1999 01:34:46 GMT 
   Server: Apache/1.3.6 (Unix) 
   Connection: close 
 
 and no further data.  The correct behavior would be to give an
 "HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified" header.

 What does it return if your script *doesn't* have a Status field
 in its response header?
