I was monitoring my web server, and noticed that Apache

I had MaxRequestsPerChild set to 1000 .

Now I've upped MaxRequestsPerChild to 10000 and it seems to
be turning over around 11785 .

Just set MaxRequestsPerChild, and monitor the server,

Nope.

 Linux 1.2.8!?!?   Erm... that is ancient and could have countless bugs.
 
 I would really have to suggest that running on such an ancient system
 could be the cause of any unknown number of bugs.

 What makes you say that?  Give exact example output from the status page
 that you say shows this.

 Nope.  That's where the "+" comes in.  It's patched a lot,
 and runs beautifully.  It ran NCSA 1.[45].x for 3 years without
 a hitch, and runs all sorts of complex software, including the
 GIMP, some hefty CGI scripts, studly versions of bind and sendmail,
 and Netscape Navigator.  It wa sone of the first CDDB servers, and
 is still going strong.  I really think it's capable of basic
 counting! 8^)
 
 This is a production system, and not easily upgraded to a whole
 new OS.  Maybe if Limnux ever gets sensible about upgrades...

 the same number before that I observed as the "kill the child"

 That's all very nice, but just because it runs other things fine doesn't
 mean it will run everything fine.  There are many known bogons on ancient
 Linux systems and we simply do not have the time or resources to track
 down the same broken Linux things time after time when simply upgrading to
 a recent version would fix it.  This is _not_ a general problem, but is
 something specific to your system.  
 
 Your gcc version is also ancient, and could have any number of bugs,
 including bugs in optimization that you are triggering by using -O2.
 
 It obviously doensn't run fine since you are complaining it doesn't.  We
 have had to track down OS bugs over and over due to people using old
 versions of the OS, compiler, etc. and we just don't have the resources to
 do so when it doesn't impact the vast majority of users.

 Erm... this is not the output of the status page.  This is parsed by
 something.
 
 What does the status page itself say?
 
 Have you added any extra modules?  Have you modified the Apache code?
 Does this happen with a base Apache without any extra modules or
 modificatoins?

 I'm not sure what you are talking about with "kill the child" number.

 Duh.  My point was that it's not a piece of useless crap as
 your email implied.

 How do you know who it impacts?  Maybe nobody noticed it.
 It's non-critical, so the impact is minimal.  If you don't
 want to work on it, just say so.
 
 All I'm asking is that you *look* at the problem instead of just 
 assuming* it isn't an Apache bug.  I make no such assumptions,
 and if it's my system, fine.
 
 I have similar behavior at work, on a FreeBSD system, where I have:
 
    MaxRequestsPerChild 100
 
 and it kills the child and forks a new one at 30 or 31 (granted,
 it's still using Apache 1.2.5, but it's a similar problem).
 
 
 |Erm... this is not the output of the status page.  This is parsed by

 Wrong.  The default status page outputs TABLE tags.  Cutting
 and pasting TABLE output (at least from my version of Navigator
 into vi) results in unusable formatting.  So I used the "notable"
 option to the status module.  It's a *standard* part of the
 status module.
 
 Try it: /status?notable .
 
 |Does this happen with a base Apache without any extra modules or
 |modificatoins?
 
 That's what I'm using.  If I'd had extra modules or hacks, I'd have
 said so where it asked on the bugs form.
 
 |I'm not sure what you are talking about with "kill the child" number.
 
 The number of accesses per child, after which it *really* kills the child
 and forks a new process, instead of the number set in the config file.

Comment-Added:
This is possibly due to persistent connexions, which
increment the request count without (currently) counting
against MaxRequestsPerChild setting..

State-Changed-When: Thu Jun 10 05:12:37 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
MaxRequestsPerChild is actually max _connections_ per child. In other words, what we're seeing is the effect of keepalive requests. So the child is handling 11700 requests, for example, but only 10000 connections. The newer docs make this clear.
