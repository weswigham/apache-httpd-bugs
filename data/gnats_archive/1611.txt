>Description:
I want to shut down Apache on Windows 95 by an external programm. (in my case to avoid the message of Windows 95 when shutting down the system, that ther server is still running. Other userfull usage of this might be cases when you want to/ have to shutdown and restart the server in regular invervals.) I know this is pretty easy when using Windows NT. On Windows 95 i have tried to start Apache by a launcher with redirected StandardIo-Handles. Sending a Control-C over stdin doesn't help, as Apache seems to direct the handles back to standard. TerminateProcess with the handle returned by CreateProcess doesn't work either. (It does nothing.) Anyway TerminateProcess is not a recommended way to terminate an executable in Win32, as this might leave some System-DLL's in an undefined state. 

So what I am looking for, is a way to tell Apache to shut down
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think it would be a good idea, to have a named Event, that could be raised by other applications. This would allow a commandline switch for Apache to shutdown the server and also allow other applications to do the same in a sane manner

State-Changed-By: kparz@raleigh.ibm.com
State-Changed-When: Mon Oct 26 11:17:28 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
A new option has been added to Apache to shutdown the
server. Once the server is running, you can bring up a 
command line prompt and type:
"apache -k shutdown"
It is implemented pretty much as you describe.  There is 
now a global event which is used to trigger the shutdown.

Thanks for using Apache!!
