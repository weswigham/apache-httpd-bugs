>Description:
Hi, I have a problem with apache 1.3.14 and map files. This is one of
these "it used to work" problems. I've been running Stronghold v2 for some
time, and now I'm switching to Apache 1.3.14 (without stronghold)
and finding something that
behaves differently.

The current version of Stronghold I've been running is 2.4.2 which uses
Apache 1.3.6.  The map file does not contain any tabs. It looks like
this:

rect  /cgi-bin/Logout.cgi?script=http://www.it.wsu.edu/ 2,2 172,23

This was called from an html stream with:

      <a href="/images/kpasswd_logout.map">
      <IMG BORDER=0 SRC="/images/kpasswd_logout.gif" ISMAP></a>

This works fine with Stronghold. Now comes the fun part. Now I've
upgraded to apache 1.3.14 and when I run this map file with MSIE v5 it
works fine. However, if I run this with Netscape (eg v4.76) it fails. It
gives me a message that says:

"The document contained no data. try again later, or contact the
server's administrator"

One thing I've noticed is that the MSIE call says it is using HTTP 1.1:

pooh.it.wsu.edu - - [31/Oct/2000:16:03:16 -0800] "GET
/images/kpasswd_logout.map?97,12 HTTP/1.1" 302 352
pooh.it.wsu.edu - - [31/Oct/2000:16:03:17 -0800] "GET
/cgi-bin/Logout.cgi?script=http://www.it.wsu.edu/ HTTP/1.1" 302 293

The hit from Netscape, however, says it is using HTTP 1.0:

tigger.it.wsu.edu - - [31/Oct/2000:16:03:53 -0800] "GET
/images/kpasswd_logout.map?114,10 HTTP/1.0" 302 340

Notice it calls the map but not the cgi.

Now, one more thing. If I modify the map file to have "http:" before the
relative reference in the *.map file, it works in netscape (but not MSIE). 
For example, if I change the above map entry to:

rect http:/cgi-bin/Logout.cgi?script=http://www.dceweb.it.wsu.edu/ 2,2 172,23

and click on the image, then it works:

 tigger.it.wsu.edu - - [31/Oct/2000:16:05:19 -0800] "GET
/images/kpasswd_logout.map?100,9 HTTP/1.0" 302 320
tigger.it.wsu.edu - - [31/Oct/2000:16:05:21 -0800] "GET
/cgi-bin/Logout.cgi?script=http://www.dceweb.it.wsu.edu/ HTTP/1.0" 302
288

Is this a problem with http 1.0 protocol?
A problem with apache?
Isn't this map entry acceptable by the standards??

rect  /cgi-bin/Logout.cgi?script=http://www.it.wsu.edu/ 2,2 172,23

without needing the "http:" before the relative url?

any help appreciated. thanks -- Dean
