>Description:
I have a test PHP script that I'm trying to run as a cgi script (i.e., no php_mod... I have the appropriate AddType defined in srm.conf)... here's the bug...

If I run it from the command line (./test.php3) it executes just fine, but if I hit it with my browser Apache sends a page that says "no input selected." The log file then reports "(8)Exec format error"

The script is as the path to php, opening html headers and then the line:
<?php echo "test"; ?>

Executing on the command line results with "test"... but through Apache results in the error above.

I ran a backtrace on it and got:
Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt
 0x4010fcf2 in __libc_accept ()
 #0 0x4010fcf2 in __libc_accpet ()
 #1 0x80701ae in strcpy ()

 rtld_fini=0x4000a350<_dl_fini, stack_end=0xbffffd3c)
 at ../sysdeps/generic/libc-start.c:78

NOTE: My web hosting company uses php as a cgi script with no mod_php, and I'm trying to mirror that at home. That's how I know it's possible.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Here's my test script test.php3 (only I have opening and closing HTML and BODY tags)...

#!/usr/local/bin/apache
<php? 
echo "test"; 
?>

2. In srm.conf set:
AddType cgi-script .php3

3. Put the above script in your cgi-bin directory five it execute permissions and hit it with your browser.

 Please stop repeatedly submitting such things.
 
 The first time you refused to provide full information, so your report was
 closed.
 
 Now you decide to give me what I asked for before, and it is clear that
 you don't really understand how CGIs work.  You can't put 
 "#!/usr/local/bin/apache" as a line on a script!  I'm afraid we cannot
 help you with such issues, this is for bug reports about Apache not basic
 Unix tutorials.
 
 I suggest you also try reading the PHP docs.

 That was a typo in the report only (it's correct on
 the script), it was supposed to be
 #!/usr/local/bin/php if the path to php was wrong, do
 you think it would have executed from command line??
 
 As for 'beginner unix tutorials' I've been writing
 scripts and using unix for a few years now... which is
 enough to know what I'm doing with regard to writing a
 TEST script... I'm NO expert, but I can write scripts,
 and run a fully backended website along with being a
 freelance webbuilder...
 
 Ya know, I provided you with everything a first,
 second, and now third time... I don't know why you
 need to pick on a stupid typo just because for
 whatever reason you have a problem with something I
 did or said. I have a legitimate bug report with a
 FULL details... I'm asking you nicely, again, please
 just look over the bug report... you'll see it's a
 real problem with in-depth details.
