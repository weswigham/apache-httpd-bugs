>Description:
Unzipped Apache file apache_1_3b6_alphaNT.zip from root-directory, c:\Apache, went
into Apache directory and typed Apache conf\httpd.conf.  Received message
"The image file C:\apache\Apache.exe is valid, but is for a machine type other than
the current machine."

I looked for a .exe file as describe on the web-site, didn't find one, but found
the file above in the binaries section.  Where is the .exe file for Windows NT?

thanks,
Ismael

What platform are you running on?  Alpha or x86?

If you are running x86 then of course the alpha binary won't work!
