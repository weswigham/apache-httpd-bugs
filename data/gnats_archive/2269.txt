    [patch elided for reasons related to U.S. crypto export controls]

>How-To-Repeat:
Not relevant  But, the configure.ssl script sets things up for the ssl httpd
compile.

    [patch elided for reasons related to U.S. crypto export controls]

>Fix:
I had a problem integrating the patches cause I missed a "writev" which had
to be avoided if in ssl mode.

I found some problems with the default httpd.conf.  Example: CustomLog was set
to logs/access_log and should have been var/logs/error_log.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm not sure why you submitted this to the main Apache
bug database, since it's clearly meant for Ben Laurie
personally and equally clearly you have his email address..
Whatever, there's nothing here that applies to the main
Apache project, so I'm closing this.  Ben *has* received
the message..  Thanks for using Apache!
