>Description:
We are getting the following error.

fcntl: F_SETLKW: Error getting accept lock, exiting!  Perhaps you need to use the LockFile directive to place your lock file on a local disk!
[Wed Oct 18 14:03:31 2000] [notice] child pid 19796 exit signal Segmentation Fault (11)
[Wed Oct 18 14:07:59 2000] [emerg] (9)Bad file number: fcntl: F_SETLKW: Error getting accept lock, exiting!  Perhaps you need to use the LockFile directive to place your lock file on a local disk!

This bug has been reported before: Bugs 5593, 5483, 5499,and 5906. We don't have a NFS file system.

We have two servers and both giving the same errors. After user opens a session it works for 10-30 request. Eventually it kills the child process. After a dew sesions, you cannot get any response from the server.

Any help will be greatly appreacited.
