Linux kibiras 2.2.19 #1 Fri Jun 8 13:30:13 EET 2001 i686 unknown
gcc version 2.95.4 20011006 (Debian prerelease)
>Description:
if one uses sorting ability of the mod_autoindex without a direction (eg. ?N=),
mod_autoindex sorts in descending order, however the source of mod_autoindex
has a little bug, which prevents doing that. Fix is more than simple, see the patch.
>How-To-Repeat:
give ?N= parameter for the directory and see how it is sorted in descending order (instead of ascending).
