 =============================================
 Are You Too Busy Working To Earn Any Money?
 =============================================
 
 I used to work hard. 18-hour days, 7-day weeks. The more I did, the more that my boss expected me to do. 
 
 It wasn't until I started to do less, a lot less, that I found I could make more money than I ever dreamed of 
 making.
 
 Are you looking for a business that 
   - you can do at home, while you continue working? 
   - can replace your salary and give you extra monthly income? 
   - can provide peace of mind, security and wealth?
 
 I can show you how you can "work" just 2 hours a day, one day a week and make more money than you are 
 earning now. 
 (It doesn't matter what your current income is because this business plan will earn more than you could 
 possible earn working for someone else).
 
 This business is not multi-level marketing (I hate pestering my friends and family to buy stuff so that strangers 
 can get rich) nor it does it include stuffing envelopes (doesn't everyone know that they are all done by 
 machine anyway). 
 
 I am going to send you a detailed, 50-page illustrated report of how I have turned the stock market into a 
 money making machine. Now, before you get worried about day-trading and all of the other nightmares 
 associated with "Get Rich Quick" schemes, I want you to know a little about myself.
 
 I used to be of the mind to "Buy and Hold". This was a great idea as long as the general trend was going up. 
 But now that the high fliers have bitten the dirt, what do we do now? Hold on until they drop even further?
 
 The strategy that I have developed is to identify stocks on the NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX that are poised for 
 a rapid breakout in growth and supported by multi-million dollar investors buying as well. These are NOT 
 penny-stocks. These are some of the biggest, most widely-respected names in the American economy!!!
 
 Using the strategies that you will find inside the "Get Rich Steady" manual, anyone , I repeat ANYONE, can 
 identify 30-40 prime candidates poised for explosive growth EVERY WEEK!! 
 
 --------------------------------------------------
 It is not a matter of finding a needle in a haystack, 
 but rather being a child in a candy store!!
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 You will be presented with so many opportunities that you will not know what to choose first. Don't worry, all of 
 this is explained in the manual you will be receiving.
 
 Let me make this perfectly clear: I am NOT asking you to send me your investment money. In fact, I'll refuse to 
 take it. When people examine the strategy that I offer, when they see the profits that this strategy generates, 
 they push their checkbooks at me, insisting that I trade stocks on their behalf.
 
 I do NOT want your money. 
 
 What I am offering you is the knowledge of how to find these explosive growth stocks on your own, in the 
 comfort of your own home. With the knowledge that you will receive, you will be able to make your decisions 
 and be better off because of it.
 
 =================================================
    Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, 
    teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
 
 Are you willing to learn one simple strategy that will provide you with more than $10,000 month after month in 
 less than a year?
 =================================================
 
 This is a true business that you can conduct from the security of your bedroom, den or even your kitchen 
 table. You can get as deeply involved in this business as you want or you can just use it to supplement your 
 income. 
 
 You decide, since you will be your own boss.
 
 You can begin this business on paper with 100% security, recording specific shares to buy and what you 
 would pay for them. In this way you can prove to yourself how powerful this business plan is. The software to 
 track the investments is >> FREE << and you will receive 3 FREE months of updates to prove to yourself that 
 this program really is as powerful as I say it is.
 
 It has taken me three years to perfect this business idea, and during that time I have made more money than I 
 know what to do with.
 
 Right now, you should be asking yourself 
 
 ========================================
 "So why are you telling me about it?"
                  Good question.
 ========================================
 
 When you are able to pay off your mortgage (with cash), take all the vacations you want, pay your bills, buy a 
 new car (with cash), eat at the finest restaurants, wear the best clothes and enjoy the lifestyle that less than 1 
 in a 1000 people get to enjoy, what do you do next? 
 
 Simple: You give back to society so that others can benefit as well. This is my way of giving back.
 
 Do you really think it matters to me whether Bill Gates has 100 billion dollars? or Jeff Bezos has 60 billion? Of 
 course not. All that matters is what is in my personal bank account. As long as my family has more than 
 enough to ensure their security, why would I not want to share this idea with others?
 
 At the end of this letter, I am going to give you a link to my web-site. I am going to ask you to send me $19.95. 
 In return for your trust, I am going to send you a 50-page illustrated manual that gives you the full details of 
 how I was able to achieve the lifestyle that only a few have achieved. The detailed steps are so clearly laid 
 out that even a 12-year old can follow them.
 
 To make this offer even more interesting for you, I will give you a full 30-day, MONEY BACK GUARENTEE. If 
 you feel that the information that I send to you isn't 100% accurate and factual and worth every penny of the 
 $19.95, just let me know and I will cheerful refund your money.
 
 This business plan does not require education. I have clients who have barely made it past Grade 8.
 
 This business does not require skill. If you can tell the difference between the colors red and yellow and 
 green, you have all the skill you need.
 
 This business does not require luck. Luck is simply being in the right place at the right time, Some people 
 have been more "lucky" than others but it really isn't a factor in your success.
 
 This business doesn't require talent. You just need to know the right time to buy and the right time to sell, and I 
 will be giving you all of that information in the 50-page manual.
 
 This business doesn't require experience. My 12 year old son uses the strategies included in this manual and 
 shares them with his classmates.
 
 This business doesn't require youth. Anyone can operate this business no matter what their age.
 
 What does it require? Belief.
 
 You need to believe enough to click on the link included and receive the 50-page illustrated manual. You 
 need to believe enough to carefully read the manual until you understand the strategies explained. You need 
 to believe enough in the principals enough to put them to test. You need to believe enough to try this 
 business strategy for the full month, RISK-FREE!! If you do that, nothing more and nothing less, the wealth 
 that you will be receiving will be hard to believe. 
 
 =============================
 Remember, I GUARENTEE it!!
 =============================
 
 I know you are skeptical. What you have heard and what you are going to read in this manual is contrary to 
 what you have heard your whole life from your friends, your parents, your family and maybe everyone else you 
 know.
 
 --------------------------------------------------
 All I can ask you is this:
                 How many of them are millionaires?
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 So it is now up to you. One month from now, you can be 30 days older and still have your $19.95 safely in 
 your pants pocket, or you can be well on your way to getting rich.
 
 You decide.
