>Environment:
Operating System:       AIX 1.3.0 ptf 0024 (i386)
Compiler:               gcc 2.7.2.3
Compiler Options:       -O3 -m486
>Description:
The strtoul() function is not available on AIX under release 1.X versions of
the operating system.  The strtoul() function is used in the module
modules/proxy/libproxy.a.  Specifically, this call us used twice in the file
modules/proxy/proxy_util.c.

It appears that there may be need for some sort of "compatability" library
that would make this function (and probably some other functions for other
operating systems) available.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile on an AIX 1.3 system with the module modules/proxy/libproxy.a
>Fix:
I was able to work around this problem by using a copy of strtoul that came from
the latest Tcl/Tk 8.0 distribution.  I compiled it to a .o file, and then added
this file name to the EXTRA_LIBS entry in the Configuration file.  It's not real
pretty, but it works.  A more generalized solution is recommended.

I'm not positive what is the best way to recommend this be implemented in the
Apache code, so I just did a quick and dirty hack to get things working with
this release.  If you have any suggestions about how to proceed, I can give it
a try.

Thanks

Yup we've got another PR in here already for this problem...
I'm too lazy to look up the number.  It should be fixed in a
future beta.
