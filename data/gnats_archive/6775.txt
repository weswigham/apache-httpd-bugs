>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux Redhat 6.2, g++/gcc 2.95.2 (whatever comes w/ rh6.2)
>Description:
In mass virtual hosting you may have a file vhost.map which has:
www.abc.com /home/httpd/abc
www.bcd.com /home/httpd/bcd
etc...

The lines
RewriteMap vhost txt:/pathto/vhost.map
RewriteCond ${vhost:${SERVER_NAME or HOST_NAME}} ^(/.*)$
RewriteRule ^/(.*) %1/$1

will always return simply /$1 because it seems that the ${vhost} always
returns a zero length string


>How-To-Repeat:
Try to do that mass virtual hosting ... instructions are found in a link
off the apache manual
>Fix:
Compiling apache 1.3.12 and using the exact same configs will fix the problem.
It also seems that the default install of apache1.3.12 has the same problem
as apache1.3.14... so perhaps it's not totally specific to 1.3.14.
