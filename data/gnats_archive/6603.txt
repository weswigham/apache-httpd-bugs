>Environment:
Microsoft Windows 2000 Version 5.00.2195
>Description:
When I type in Apache to run it says
"apache: cannot determine local host name. 
 Use the ServerName directive to set it manually."
Then when I installed it as a service like so "Apache -i -n "Apache Web Server" it succeeds but then I try to run it like so "Net Start "Apache Web Server"" and here is what is says.
*************
C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\logs>net start "Apache Web Server"
The Apache Web Server service is starting.
The Apache Web Server service could not be started.

A system error has occurred.

System error 1067 has occurred.

The process terminated unexpectedly.
