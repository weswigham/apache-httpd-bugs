>Description:
Recently I have tried to upgarde my windows apache server to 1.3.14 and subsequently 1.3.17 - both I have had to reject due to (different) mod_rewrite problems

Problems from rewrite.log:

Apache 1.3.14
10.1.230.32 - - [20/Feb/2001:12:40:48 +0000]
[redirect3.com/sid#65628c][rid#70b390/initial] (5) map lookup OK:
map=lowercase key=%{HTTP_HOST -> val=%{http_host

as you can see the variable %{HTTP_HOST} is not being translated (I guess
it's because it's matching the first { with the first } and not it's
matching one)



Apache 1.3.17
10.1.230.32 - - [23/Feb/2001:15:14:42 +0000] [homer/sid#65628c][rid#700338/initial] (4) RewriteCond: input='${lowercase:homer}' pattern='^(www\.)?(.*)$' => matched

as you can see the map lookup is not being detected


This works nicely under Apache 1.3.9...

What's gone wrong?

>How-To-Repeat:
Turn on mod_rewrite and add the following httpd.conf snippet:

# turn on the rewrite engine
RewriteEngine on

# set path for log file
RewriteLog logs/rewrite.log

# set level of logging 0=none 9=max
RewriteLogLevel 9
RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower
RewriteMap easyweb txt:web-forwarding.conf

# define maps
# convert server name to lowercase
RewriteCond ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}}          ^(www\.)?(.*)$
# lookup server name in web forwarding file
RewriteCond ${webforward:%2}                   ^(.+)$
# if its there then redirect to new url
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$                            %1$1 [R,L]

I haven't a clue!

Comment-Added:

User further reports (on testing 1.3.18):

yup, that's got it - 1.3.18 is the key

thanx for your assistance, I was starting to get worried that this
functionality had gone forever...

I run perl as cgi from apache so there's no problem there and I'm running
PHP4.0.4 as a module (which looks fine)
