State-Changed-Why:

How are you setting the port to 82?  By manually editing
the httpd.conf file?

By the way, port 82 is reserved for the XFER service.  (See
<http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers>.)

 Yes, I manually edited the httpd.conf and had to manually edit apachectl
 to make fullstatus work.
 
 Checking Makefile for the install part, it only replaces "Port 80" to
 "Port conf_port". There is NO port replacement for apachectl.

 That is not the point.

 If you manually changed the httpd.conf file, what did you expect
 to happen to make the apachectl script automatically match?

 Did you use 'make install' to change to port 82, or manual editing?
 If the former, this looks like a legitimate issue; if the latter,
 probably not.  If you used 'make install', what was the exact
 command you used to set the configuration to use port 82?

 Which is why I said "by the way."
