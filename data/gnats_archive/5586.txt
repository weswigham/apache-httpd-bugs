>Organization:
>Environment:
Win. NT Server 4.0 SP 5 128bit encryption
>Description:
configured apache and tested config, syntax OK...installed as a service, started service..ran fine...restarted machine...403 Forbidden Error message comes up...stop service...wait about 30 seconds...start service...apache works fine...

I am also running ColdFusion Server and the module that I am using in Apache is not the newest version..would the older module, although still working, cause apache to have a problem starting?  

I had the same configuration before...but using 1.3.7 and never had this problem..I'm thinking of regressing back to that version again.
>How-To-Repeat:
install apache 1.3.9 and ColdFusion Server onto a dual PIII-500Mhz, 384Mb RAM, running Win NT Server 4.0 (128 bit encryption), using default ColdFusion module that comes with ColdFusion Server
>Fix:
I have no clue

State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:32:21 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Sounds like a coldfusion problem, I'd upgrade.
1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as 1.3.19 and 
prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/
