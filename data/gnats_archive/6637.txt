>Environment:
FreeBSD - all version. My version is 4.1 (base).  GNU cc..
>Description:
FreeBSD (probably other BSD flavors.. I don't know what O/S'es have this functionality) employs a login capabilities database wherein certain classes of users can have limits imposed upon them, such as max cpu time, memory, # of procs, filesize, etc.  It's a wonderful addition to my suexec (see patch below; I'm sure it needs to be MUCH better than what I've done for general distribution) - it helps prevent runaway cgi's.
If you need more info on these routines or a platform or anything, I'll lend a hand.
Thanks!
