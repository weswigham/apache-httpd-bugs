>Description:
If a users MAKEFLAGS include "e" and they run "./configure" things work fine.
If a users MAKEFLAGS include "e" and they run "CC=gcc ./configure" things fail
as follows:


$ export MAKEFLAGS=e
$ CC=gcc ./configure
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.22
 + Warning: Configuring Apache with default settings.
 + This is probably not what you really want.
 + Please read the README.configure and INSTALL files
 + first or at least run './configure --help' for
 + a compact summary of available options.
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Solaris 270 platform
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
 + using builtin Expat
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed.  The below error output from the compilation
** test will give you an idea what is failing. Note that
** Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such as gcc. 

cd ..;       -o helpers/dummy helpers/dummy.c   -lsocket -lnsl
sh: -o: execute permission denied
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `dummy'
Current working directory /users/wmt/apache_1.3.22/src/helpers
======== Error Output for sanity check ========
============= End of Error Report =============

 Aborting!
>How-To-Repeat:
see Full Description
>Fix:
I suggest having the top level configure script explicitly check the MAKEFLAGS 
environmental variable and report on settings which are known to cause problems,
for example MAKEFLAGS settings that contain "e".
