>Description:
I need help with Virtual Hosting under apache_1.3.1.  Here is some
background.  My server is behind a Cisco Pix firewall and responds
to the IP address 206.52.116.9 which is www.phodyn.com.  The
DocumentRoot for this address is /opt/apache/htdocs.  We have two
CNAME aliases (www.photondynamics.com and www.phtn.com) which I
want to point to our corporate web page (for the viewing public)
under /opt/apache/htdocs/phtn.  In addition, since this thing
runs on our internal network, it's real name is phtn (with a www
alias) and the domain is photon.com.  Internal users can access 
the server by going to http://www.photon.com.  I have been trying
to get the NameVirtualHost directives to work but without much luck.

Here is how I have things setup in the httpd.conf file:

NameVirtualHost 206.52.116.9
<VirtualHost 206.52.116.9>
ServerAdmin patc@phodyn.com
DocumentRoot /opt/apache/htdocs
ServerName www.phodyn.com
ErrorLog logs/www.phodyn.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.phodyn.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>
NameVirtualHost 206.52.116.9
<VirtualHost 206.52.116.9>
ServerAdmin patc@phodyn.com
DocumentRoot /opt/apache/htdocs/phtn
ServerName www.photondynamics.com
ErrorLog logs/www.photondynamics.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.photondynamics.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>
NameVirtualHost 206.52.116.9
<VirtualHost 206.52.116.9>
ServerAdmin patc@phodyn.com
DocumentRoot /opt/apache/htdocs/phtn
ServerName www.phtn.com
ErrorLog logs/www.phtn.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.phtn.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>

I get the error message:

[Wed Aug  5 11:16:18 1998] [warn] NameVirtualHost 206.52.116.9:80 has no VirtualHosts
[Wed Aug  5 11:16:18 1998] [warn] NameVirtualHost 206.52.116.9:80 has no VirtualHosts
[Wed Aug  5 11:16:18 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.1 (Unix) configured -- resuming normal operations

And as can be expected when I try to go to www.phtn.com or www.photondynamics.com
I get the main servers document root.  Under apache_1.2.5 I setup the httpd.conf
file like so:

<VirtualHost 206.52.116.9>
ServerAdmin patc@phodyn.com
DocumentRoot /opt/apache_1.2.5/htdocs
ServerName www.phodyn.com
ErrorLog logs/www.phodyn.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.phodyn.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost 206.52.116.9>
ServerAdmin patc@phodyn.com
DocumentRoot /opt/apache_1.2.5/htdocs/phtn
ServerName www.photondynamics.com
ErrorLog logs/www.phodyn.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.phodyn.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost 206.52.116.9>
ServerAdmin patc@phodyn.com
DocumentRoot /opt/apache_1.2.5/htdocs/phtn
ServerName www.phtn.com
ErrorLog logs/www.phodyn.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.phodyn.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>

And everything works just fine.  

I've tried several different configurations under apache_1.3.1 and tried
using ServerAlias directives and mixed IP-based and Name-based virtual
hosts but can't seem to get the same results I had under apache_1.2.5.
I've read the FAQ, looked at the examples and can't seem to get it right.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I absolutely love the apache
server by the way!
>How-To-Repeat:
I can setup my server for you (I've gone back to apache_1.2.5 for now).
If you visit http://www.phodyn.com you'll see the /opt/apache/htdocs/index.html
and if you go to either www.photondynamics.com or www.phtn.com you'll see the
public web page (/opt/apache/htdocs/phtn/index.html).  I'd be happy
to supply an additional information as required.  I guess I'm stumped because
I had this working rather easily under apache_1.2.5 and I understand the
the NameVirtualHost directive was supposed to make things easier but for
me it's been more difficult.
>Fix:
I'm sure this isn't truly a bug.  It's more of a setup issue.  I don't
have access to the newsgroups (post capabilities) at this time which is
why I'm submitting this here.

Thanks for your attention.

 What is your Port directive set to?
 
 Do you have any Listen directives set?

 That is why we list somewhere where anyone with web access can read
 and post to Usenet... (dejanews).

 Just the default.
 
 >> Do you have any Listen directives set?
 
 No, but I didn't have to set any under 1.2.5.  Should I setup separate =
 listens for
 each virtual host?  Like so:
 
 Listen 206.52.116.9:8080
 Listen 206.52.116.9:8090
 
 Then do the virtual hosts calling them?
 
 <VirtualHost 206.52.116.9:8080>
 ServerName www.phodyn.com
 DocumentRoot /opt/apache/htdocs
 ...
 
 and
 
 <VirtualHost 206.52.116.9:8090>
 ServerName www.phtn.com
 ServerAlias www.photondynamics.com
 DocumentRoot /opt/apache/htdocs/phtn
