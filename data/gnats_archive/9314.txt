>Description:
Using ISAPI ServerSupportFunction with the above constant works incorrectly if used in a virtual directory that is not located in the Apache root directory. It also returns the path with a stray slash at the end.

Example:

Assume I have a virtual mapped to d:\westwind\wconnect.

If I have a script that references /wconnect ServerSupoportFunction returns:

d:/program files/apache group/apache/htdocs/wconnect\

It should return:

d:/westwind/wconnect

Notice the stray backslash at the end. THe slash may be Ok but it should at least be the right slash. FWIW, IIS returns without a trailing backslash and IIS compatibility is probably what's important here so it can work on both platforms.
