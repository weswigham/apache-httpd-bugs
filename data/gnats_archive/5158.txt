>Description:
Feature request:

It would be nice to have SNMP support for apache (maybe in v2.x) as
part of the standard apache distribution.

We would like to monitor our apache intranet servers with tools
like nethealth or tivoli using a SNMP agent as part of a high availability
solution.

SNMP support is IMO a usefull feature for e.g. large ISPs to monitor
apache (or any webserver) for troubleshooting and performance.
I know that some monitoring features can be done using e.g. shell
or perl scripts (e.g. pinging the host or retrieving test pages via
netcat, etc.) but this seems to me a little of a patchwork.


A module for apache 1.3.6 is availably on:

tnx for listening - rainer
