>Description:
org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.processRequest makes a call to ServletContext.log(String, Throwable). This method is not available in Servlet 2.0 API.  It gives the following log entry.


[14/09/2000 23:52:05:604 PDT] java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext: method log(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V not found

State-Changed-When: Sat Sep 16 12:28:25 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
There is no call which could result w/ ServletContext.log on line
320 of JServConnection.java in the head of the CVS tree, or in
1.1, or in 1.1.1, or 1.1.2.  I'm guessing that the copy which you
have has been modified locally.

Please download a current copy of Apache-JServ (either binary rpm
or tarball) and use the jar file from that; if the problem
continues, I'd like to see a similar stack trace.
