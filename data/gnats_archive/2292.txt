>Description:
I was running 1.3b6 and all was OK.

I upgraded to 1.3b7, and as soon as I try to run my 'feedback' CGI script, I get the following error message in the log file:

[error] Premature end of script headers: e:/wwwsrv/root/rhyme/feedback.cgi

I have copied the .conf files from 1.3b6 to make sure they are OK, and have checked to make sure there are no new fields etc.

Renaming the 1.3by directory and using 1.3b6 fixes the problem.

Is there any way I can selectively copy files from 1.3b7 to see if there is
a specific offending module? Or will that break everything?
>How-To-Repeat:
I *presume* you need to try running a CGI script in the above conditions: the 
only other factor I can think of is that they script is not in the Appach directory tree, but I have tried placing it there to no avail...
>Fix:
Unfortunately not. 1.3b6 still works.
