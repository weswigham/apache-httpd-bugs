>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation (Build 1381 Service Pack 3)
Visual C++ 5.0
Dell GXpro 200 mhz, 64m ram
>Description:
Running Perl simple perl script caused Apache to run up the handles, as seen in the Task Manager. Stopping and starting the service did not clear the handles, but soft booting the workstation does clear the problem. I can still run executables from my cgi directory. It's just the Perl scripts that give an internal server error.
>How-To-Repeat:
This is the Perl script.
