Ultrix v4.5
>Description:
I get a "Forbidden" access denied to /~username/ message when I try to
access a directory that doesn't have the default file in it. (index.html)
I changed the protection, then I could get a directory. But with that
protection, I moved then index.html file back in, the server would load
index.html. It continued to load a directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can e-mail me at the above address and I can move files as necessary to
show you.
The URL I was using was http://www.western.tec.wi.us/~techsup/
