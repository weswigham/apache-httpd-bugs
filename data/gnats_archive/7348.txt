Using builtin specs.
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
>Description:
I had no user nobody or group noroot because I prefer giving each sandboxed daemon its own separate user. When I built apache, even using ./configure --server-uid=apache --server-gid=apache, nothing is logged in the error log, but this error is printed on console:

Bad user nobody

After I added a dummy user nobody, I got this complaint:

Bad group nogroup

Once I also added a dummy nogroup, apache started without any complaints -- and spawned children owned by user apache, as specified in my httpd.conf.

The bug, as far as I can tell, is that while Apache allows you to use User and Group directives to override the default user and group, it still requires the default user and group to be present. Even using the appropriate ./configure options to change the compiled-in default did not solve this.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile and configure Apache on a system with no user nobody.
Change User directive to a user that DOES exist (in httpd.conf)
Any of the following three commands will yield the Bad user nobody error:
apachectl configtest
apachectl start
httpd
>Fix:
Apache needs not check for the existence of compiled-in defaults if the User and Group directives exist in httpd.conf and reference a valid uid/gid.
If those directives do not exist or are invalid, apache should go by  the defaults provided to configure by --server-uid and --server-gid.

Only if the config file does not reference a valid uid/gid AND the --server-uid/--server-gid directives were either invalid or absnet, should apache check for (and require) a hardcoded user nobody or a hardcoded group nogroup.
