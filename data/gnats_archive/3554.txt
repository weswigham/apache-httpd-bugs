>Organization:
>Environment:
OSF1  V4.0D 878 alpha running on a 600au personal workstation
>Description:
I compiled the server with maximum dynamicaly loaded modules and added in 
 mod_perl-1.16_01  and php-3.0.5 as dynamic modules also.
all seemed to be working well (for several weeks) until I set
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
AllowOverride AuthConfig 
options to document root directory inaccess.conf 
(to enable .htaccess files). After restarting the server 
directory indexing seems to have been disabled. Subsequently, no amount of 
stopping the server, resetting the original options etc, restarting
switches the directory indexing back on. 

I can however fix the problem by completely rebooting the computer the
Apache server is running on, But having done so, shutting down the server
and restarting, i get the same no indexes problem (no reading of directory contents
and no reading of the index.html file).

There seem to be a few errors in the error log also, as indicated below

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
As stated, the problem is circumvented by starting the server on a 
cleanly booted system. I can live with this, but I suspect you might
want to look at it further.

State-Changed-Why:
This is very unlikely to be any issue with Apache, and is
probably related to how you are starting it.

How are you starting it at boot?  Are you sure it is using the
same config files when started at boot as when you are starting
it later?  Are you sure there are no -d or -f flags pointing
to different config files that you are missing?
