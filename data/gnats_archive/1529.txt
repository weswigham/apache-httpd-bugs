>Environment:
NT 4.0 sp3, 1.3b3 precompiled
>Description:
If I wanted to have a file with spaces on my server, I have to call it with
%20's replacing the spaces. When I download the file, though, the %20's are
in the filename.
>How-To-Repeat:
n/a
>Fix:
I suggest that the server recognizes that you are requesting a file with %20
or any other replacement, and then sends the file with the filename intact.
For example. Request "the%20file%20I%20request.file"
I want it to save to my system as "the file I wanted.file" without having to
manually replace the substitutions

State-Changed-When: Sun Dec  7 21:32:24 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Apache does not tell the client what filename to use and
has no control over it.  If the client you are using is saving
things in that manner and you don't like it, you really
need to take the issue to the client vendor.

URLs can not have spaces in, period.  What the server
chooses to call the file once it downloads it is up to
it.  Some clients to behave as you want and put the
spaces in.
