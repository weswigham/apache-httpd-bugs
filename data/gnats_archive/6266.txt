Here is a protocol transcript:

GET /index.html.se HTTP/1.1
Host: bongo
If-Modified-Since: Thu, 16 Mar 2000 19:26:49 GMT

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 01 Jul 2000 21:33:06 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0a4
Last-Modified: Thu, 16 Mar 2000 19:26:48 GMT

And some debug output from that request:
if-mod-since 817775339756866.000000... mtime: 953234808000000.000000  req: 962487186241655.000000

That time is in december '95 ...
it _seems_ like ap_implode_time is doing something funky... (not 100% sure though)
>How-To-Repeat:
Ask for a if-modified-since later than it's mtime and you won't get the correct header/content back.
>Fix:
Make the date parsing work 8)

State-Changed-Why:
This bug has been fixed in CVS.  The problem was in
ap_implode_time.  We were using the .tm_usec and .tm_gmtoff
fields, but they were never being initialized in
ap_parseHTTPdate.  I have initialized both of those to zero,
because the spec says we don't care about granularity finer
than 1 sec (.tm_usec) and all times are in GMT (.tm_gmtoff).

Thank you for the bug report, and I am sorry it took so long
to find and fix.
