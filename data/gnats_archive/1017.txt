>Description:
Somehow mod_proxy doesn't seem to work in the debugging (-X) mode.
After 10-20 accesses through the proxy server, the server just exits.
Do you happen to know why?

I tried this with apache 1.2.1 and 1.3a1 and got the same result.
There's nothing in the error log about the problem.

I'd really appreciate any help you can offer on this.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any URL will do.  For example, try http://www.m-w.com/netdict.htm.
The proxy server dies on the third reload.

 This almost always happens because the server reaches the
 MaxRequestsPerChild setting.

Standard -X teething pains ... server still respects MaxRequestsPerChild
I'm sure a bunch of us have gone through this :)
