>Description:
Encrypted passwords created by "htpasswd" use 12-bit (two-byte) salts, even on
systems (such as FreeBSD) that use improved password hashing algorithms and can
support longer salts.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a FreeBSD 2.x / 3.x system, configured to use MD5-based password hashing,
create a password file with "htpasswd -c" and note that the salt (between the
second and third dollar signs) is only two bytes long.  Compare with the pass-
word strings in /etc/master.passwd, which use longer salts.
>Fix:
The "add_password" routine in htpasswd.c can be enhanced to generate a longer
salt string.  Here is a patch that worked for me.  Alternatively, the author-
ization code could be rewritten to use a different password scheme altogether.

State-Changed-Why:

This has already been changed for the next release after
1.3.4.  The '-m' flag will result in the use of an MD5
hash based upon FreeBSD's, and the use of a 64-bit salt
in all cases.
Thanks for the report and for using Apache!
