>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
WIN2k Server sp2,  JDK 1.3.1_01
>Description:
This is frequently appearing in javascript exceptions reported by Netscape browser:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

This is frequently appearing in served pages in all browsers:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 07 Dec 2001 00:19:20 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.22 (Win32) mod_jk pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-store Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT Servlet-Engine: Tomcat Web Server/3.2.3 (JSP 1.1; Servlet 2.2; Java 1.3.1_01; Windows 2000 5.0 x86; java.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc.) Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=90 Connection: Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1 e42     5d
>How-To-Repeat:
Use Apache 1.3.22 in combination with Tomcat 3.2.3 
Access a Web applicaions using Apache as HTTP server
>Fix:
sorry I don't. However this bug has been widely reported here:
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82948
But since we are seeing the problem in MS browsers too, it is either the apache HTTP server or Tomcat
