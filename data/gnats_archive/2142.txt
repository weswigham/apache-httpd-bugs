Server compiles clean, launches, and runs fine for several hundred hits. 
After a while the server stops responding. Netstat -na shows ESTABLISHED 
sessions which have data pending in Recv-Q. Access log does not show these 
requests, error log does not show any errors.
The last running version was 1.2.1

I can't really leave a non-functioning server up, but I can put it up on

State-Changed-Why:
Would your lockfile possible be on a NFS mounted
filesystem? It certainly sounds as if it's a blocking
issue. Is mod_status enabled? If not, try adding that
and then looking at status when the server is hung (if
it lets you)

So, does this mean the problem went away in 1.2.6, but
is back in 1.3b7?  Hmm!  And if the server gives you
the status page but not a normal document..  Do you have
mod_info included?  Will it give you the info page as well?
How about executing a script?  I'm wondering if there's
something here specifically to do with file access - the
status and info modules generate their display at run-time.
The status module doesn't open any files though the info
module does.

 The problem did not exist in the 1.2 series. I had been running 1.2.1 and
 tested 1.3b6 which displayed the problem. I upgraded my servers to 1.2.6-
 the problem was not there. I did this to try to narrow the window of
 versions where the problem had been identified.
 
 1.2.1	 no problem
 1.2.6   no problem
 1.3b3   problem
 1.3b6   problem
 1.3b7   problem
 
 Regarding the status page, this happened one time only. All the other times
 there was no response whatsoever- no script, info, status, anything. No Log
 entries in access, error, or referrer. There also seemed to be an
 insufficient number of httpds running (only one).
