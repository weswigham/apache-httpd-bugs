Linux ns 2.0.32 #1 Wed Nov 19 00:46:45 EST 1997 i586 unknown 
Heavily upgraded RedHat 5.0
>Description:
It would seem this problem is also discribed in PR#3190, PR#1950 and PR#1940.
PR#1940 was solved by upgrading glibc, which is already done: glibc-2.0.7-13 
(and did not solve the problem).

/server-status gives longer and longer times in SS and it appears as if the
children never tell the parent that they have stopped. So the parent will
not spawn new children to replace the deceased.
>How-To-Repeat:
In http://ole.tange.dk/children-dies.tgz is:
httpd.conf
errors_log
/server-status for every minute
strace -ff   of apache process and children.
>Fix:
Some better way of extracting debugging info would probably be usefull.

A temporary fix: examine if httpd has children. If not: restart apache.
It is not a good fix, if you server several 1000 vhosts.

 I have searched the bugs.apache.org and found that you look as if you have
 exactly the same problem as me.
 
 As I see the problem:
 
 The parent thinks it has a lot of children that are terrible slow at
 processing requests (SS is rather high if you look at 'apachectl status').
 So it spawns new children until it reaches the MaxClient-limit
 
 But what (I think) really happens is that the children die without
 notifying the parent.
 
 
 If we join forces maybe we can find what is common for our systems.
 
 My system is a (heavily upgraded) RedHat Linux 5.0 i386. 'rpm -qa' is
 included below.
 
 If you are a wizard in understanding strace I have made a strace of my

 Assuming my theory is correct, then I ought to get a much longer uptime if
 I raise MaxClient.
 
 I have now raised MaxClient to 256. I'll let you know if it improved the
 uptime. I *do* know that I am playing with fire: If I get 256 actual
 clients the server will probably swap until death.
 
 To the apache-team: Assuming my theory is correct, then the problem would
 be solved (or at least: worked around) if apache ran a 'ps -aux' (or
 equivalent) once in a while to see if some of the children died without
 telling.

 It improved uptime considerably. I usually have to restart 10-15 times
 pr. day. It is now 3 times - one if which is planned.

 What is your Timeout set to?  Ours was 2400, when changed to 300, the
 problem went away.  Upgrading to 1.3.3 seemed to eliminate it also.
 
 Thanks,

Is this problem still happenning with more recent redhat/glibc?

If so, can you strace the parent when the problem occurs?

strace -p pid_of_parent

 I made this Oct 30th, so the strace is pretty old:

I examined the straces a while ago, but forgot to comment.
Here's a portion of the parent's trace:

time(NULL)                              = 909702870
wait4(-1, 0xbffffe64, WNOHANG, NULL)    = 0
select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {1, 0})     = 0 (Timeout)
time(NULL)                              = 909702871
fork()                                  = 26032
wait4(-1, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], WNOHANG, NULL) = 26032
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
wait4(-1, 0xbffffe64, WNOHANG, NULL)    = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {1, 0})     = 0 (Timeout)
time(NULL)                              = 909703113

Somehow 242 seconds passed between the two time() calls... the parent does
nothing cpu intensive, so I doubt it's that.  It's possible the guy's box
is swapping to hell... but we've got about a dozen similar reports.  The
reports are against 2.0.30, 2.0.32, and 2.0.33. 

Oh then there's the odd SIGCHLD followed by ECHILD... there's a few other
instances of that -- SIGCHLDs happenning and wait4() not reporting
anything. 

The short answer:  kernel problem.  Alan Cox hasn't heard of
this problem before, so it's probably an unknown problem.

 Nope. In that case the load ought to rise, which it didnot. The problem
 was worked around by disabling keep-alives.
 
 > The reports are against 2.0.30, 2.0.32, and 2.0.33.
 
 After upgrading to kernel 2.0.36 and apache 1.3.4 I have been able to
 re-enable keepalives with no problems so far.

 The short comment: Case appears solved by upgrading.
