>Description:
I don't know if this is a server error, I just was hoping you
guys could tell me what could be happening, or at least narrow 
down the source of the problem.

I'm having some trouble figuring out why my apache v1.0.3
servers is reporting a "send script output lost connection to client"
error intermittently. This error occurs when a netscape 2.0 browser requests
a cgi program to run over a slow link ("slow link" might be a red
herring, but it is a slow link).

The comments in apache mod_cgi.c source near where the hard_timeout
is called are:

    /* Transfer any put/post args, CERN style...
     * Note that if a buggy script fails to read everything we throw
     * at it, or a buggy client sends too much, we get a SIGPIPE, so
     * we have to ignore SIGPIPE while doing this.  CERN does the same
     * (and in fact, they pretty nearly guarantee themselves a SIGPIPE
     * on every invocation by chasing the real client data with a
     * spurious newline).
     */

>How-To-Repeat:
Unforunately I haven't been able to consistently reproduce it.
>Fix:
No clue yet unfortunately.

State-Changed-Why:
This happens when the timeout as given by the 'Timeout'
directive is exceeded while sending.  It is normal to have
some of these.  When 1.2 comes out, you may want to upgrade
since it is possible one of  the many changes would reduce
how often this happens.  If you try a newer version and can
track it any further to a specific problem, please
resubmit your report.
