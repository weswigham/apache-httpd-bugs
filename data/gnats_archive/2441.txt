>Description:
I am getting some very weird logging problems in 1.3.0.  The problems were not present
in the beta versions, and I haven't changed my configuration since upgrading to 1.3.0.
This makes me suspect a software bug.

Basically, I start the httpd server and access it.  On the client-side everything
works fine, but the connection is not logged.  I try from other hosts, same thing.
What's really weird is that when I restart the server, I instantly see all the accesses
that I should have seen before, with the right time and date stamps.  Also,
sometimes accesses will appear hours later, and are out of chronological order.
I thought it might be a reverse DNS lookup problem, but the same thing occurs with
host name lookups turned off.

 Are you using NFS at all?
 
 I have trouble seeing how Apache can cause this, especially if you aren't
 compiling with any extra command line defines.

 Nope. If you need any other information, just ask.  I 've downgraded to
 1.2.6 and it's working fine, so I'm really suspecting software at this
 point; although it's strange no one else has reported a similar problem.

Please show me the output of 'httpd -V'?
Are you using any custom modules or patches?

 'httpd -V' (note the uppercase 'V') just lists all compile time flags.
 You do not need to regularly start Apache on your production server.

 Please try to use the standard Apache distribution (you can
 fetch one from http://www.apache.org/dist/) and check if you still have
 that logfile problem or not.

 If I had to guess I'd say the freebsd port includes -DBUFFERED_LOGS.  If
 so, they should be taken out and shot.  twice.  I don't have access to
 freebsd, so someone else will have to check.

State-Changed-Why:
I assume you are using the FreeBSD port (although you don't
say so and you didn't provide the output of httpd -V
as requested); in that case they define BUFFERED_LOGS
which causes this to happen on purpose.  If you dislike it,
complain to them about it.  I will get in touch with them
to see that it is fixed in future versions.

 Yes, it is.
