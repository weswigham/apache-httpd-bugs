Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Darwin platform
 + setting C compiler to cc
 + setting C pre-processor to cc -E -traditional-cpp
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
 + using builtin Expat
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed.  The below error output from the compilation
** test will give you an idea what is failing. Note that
** Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such as gcc. 

cd ..; cc  -DDARWIN -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I./lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED `./apaci`     -o helpers/dummy helpers/dummy.c   
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/libSystem.dylib load command 6 unknown cmd field
make: *** [dummy] Error 1
======== Error Output for sanity check ========
============= End of Error Report =============

 Aborting!
>How-To-Repeat:
try running ./configure --prefix=/opt/apache  on any OS X 10.1 box
>Fix:
put bullet into side of box.
