>Description:
I run a heavily-loaded web server, and everyone once in a while, the web server
will halt and not spawn any more, so I just have a script that restarts httpd
automatically.  Lately it has been happening every 20-30 minutes, and I have
been unable to find a solution so that the web server would be halting at all.
Here is an strace on the root httpd process when it is halted.

wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
nanosleep(0xbffffe34, 0xbffffe34, 0x400f8f94, 0xffffffff, 0x80b774c) = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
nanosleep(0xbffffe34, 0xbffffe34, 0x400f8f94, 0xffffffff, 0x80b774c) = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
nanosleep(0xbffffe34, 0xbffffe34, 0x400f8f94, 0xffffffff, 0x80b774c) = 0

Normally you will see getpid's and fork's when it is running properly, like this:

getpid()                                = 29028
fork()                                  = 29083
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = 0
nanosleep(0xbffffe34, 0xbffffe34, 0x400f8f94, 0xffffffff, 0x80b774c) = 0
getpid()                                = 29028
fork()                                  = 29087
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = 0
nanosleep(0xbffffe34, 0xbffffe34, 0x400f8f94, 0xffffffff, 0x80b774c) = 0
getpid()                                = 29028
fork()                                  = 29089
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = 0
nanosleep(0xbffffe34, 0xbffffe34, 0x400f8f94, 0xffffffff, 0x80b774c) = 0

I can't have it be doing this all the time obviously...
>How-To-Repeat:
Today, you will see my server on and off: www.wipd.com.  It gets to the 
'contacted www.wipd.com' part, but doesn't go on.
>Fix:
If it sees that there are no children, restart. Or if it sees that it is not
getpid'ing and fork'ing itself, restart (or start forking manually).

 RedHat 5.0?  What version of libc?

 Which specific version of glibc?  If it's a redhat system do "rpm -q libc"
 or "rpm -q glibc" or whatever the package name is.  I need to know because
 these problems do not appear on non-glibc systems and I'm still trying to
 isolate a glibc version which does cause it to happen.
 
 Is it a redhat system?

 Do you find this only on redhat 5.0's?  I believe this same problem
 happened (not as cmomonly) when I had 4.2, 4.1 and 4.0 (which use libc-5)

 I built apache myself, and have the PHP and frontpage patches on it.
 
 I don't normally send any signals to my server, but a kill -1 pid gets the
 server back up.

 Uh, you have 680 log files in your configuration.  Linux 2.0.x supports
 256 descriptors per process.  You must be using some patch which gives you
 greater than 256 per process... and I don't trust all of those patches
 100%.  In order to build a system that supports >256 descriptors safely
 you need to rebuild libc and the patch used has to be really careful. 
 
 i.e. this is an unsupported configuration... and so the problems may not
 be apache at all, they may be because you've got a bogus kernel/libc
 combination. 
 
 So, which patch are you using to increase the per process descriptor
 limit?  What other kernel patches do you have? 
 
 Can you reproduce this problem on a stock 2.0.33 system without any extra
 kernel patches?

 Yes, there's no such file.  I run an httpsd server (apache+ssl) that has
 frontpage extensions, and this doesn't happen on that.  Of course that is
 not nearly as busy.

 Yeah that's the patch I figured you were using.  Take a look at
 http://www.arctic.org/~dgaudet/patches/1024-descriptors.patch.  Notice the
 bit about INIT_NR_OPEN.  That is to protect programs that were built with
 FD_SETSIZE=256 ...
 
 You need to rebuild your C library if you use any of these patches. 
 Otherwise it still has hardcoded FD_ZERO()s and such with 256 maximums.
 You also need to build apache on a system with the larger FD_SETSIZE in
 the include files.  i.e. a lot of care has to be taken.

 I'm not sure what you mean by this... you were running apache at nice +19 ?

 nice +19 *shouldn't* cause this problem to happen... and the ethernet card
 changes shouldn't cause it to happen either.  The motherboard swap may be
 the blame though.  Have you stressed the new motherboard with, say, a full
 kernel compile but with lots of processes?  Like: 
 
     make -j7 MAKE='make -j7'
 
 I find this will show motherboard and memory problems pretty quickly. 
 
 But in this case I'm thinking the nice +19 may be more likely the blame. 
 But I can't imagine how it'd be the cause... lemme see if I can reproduce
 it.
