SunOS sanproxy1 5.7 Generic_106541-04 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
Using Apache 1.3.9 as a proxy server (non-caching).  It appears that
the server's IP address is logged to the access_log (CLF) when MaxClients
(currently set at 1000) is reached.
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be able to set MaxClients to a low number and
flood the server while monitoring the access_log.
>Fix:
Nope.
