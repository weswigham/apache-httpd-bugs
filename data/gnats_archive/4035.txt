>Description:
I'm using an Apache configuration with only a httpd.conf-file which contains all configuration information.
I'm using the mod_info-module to see what options are set up, but when I access the mod_info module it will report an error:
'No such file or directory: mod_info: couldn't open config file /etc/apache/conf/access.conf', which is true, since I'm not using that file.
In the browser mod_info will report some information, but the information report is incomplete - it's not showing any settings, such as '<Location>', etc.
There is no ResourceConfig and/or AccessConfig parameter active; this doesn't appear to be a problem to the functionality of the Apache.
It appears mod_info is not able to handle a high-perf configuration.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a single file for all configuration parameters, compile mod_info into the binary and configure the webserver to use mod_info.
Request the URI for the mod_info-module (default /server-info) and check the output, both on your browser (the output is incomplete) and in the error_log. 
>Fix:
mod_info should look at all information available (at this moment it doesn't appear to be able to completely parse the httpd.conf-file I'm using).

Do you have the "other" conf files set to /dev/null in your main config file?

 Hi,
 
 Uhm, no, as the base configuration I used a configuration which came along
 with a distribution (I don't remember if it was a configuration with a Linux
 Debian package or if it was in the Apache-tar which I downloaded). This
 httpd.conf file had the ResourceConfig and AccessConfig-parameters commented
 out; no others entered. This didn't affect the functionality of the
 webserver - everything, except mod_info, seemed to work fine, so I figured
 all was okay. I've now changed these two parameters to /dev/null and yes,
 everything functions the way it should now. Thanks.
 
 I don't want to be a smartass, but I guess it is something to take into
 consideration for new releases. Judging the fact that mod_info is smart
 enough to recognize that it can't load the access.conf and srm.conf and the
 fact that it is able to handle a /dev/null for input, I guess it would not
 be a lot of work to make mod_info more resistant to configuration mistakes.
 At the moment it appears that mod_info goes into error if one step goes
 wrong, even when all information is available.
 
 
 Thanks for your support.
