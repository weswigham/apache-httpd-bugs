>Description:
If I try to use  SSI+XBitHack (but also with .shtml type)
within virtual host DocumentRoot tree, "<!--#" SSI commands are ignored,
and the are sent to the clients as a comments.

However SSI is working as expected if it is used
within "default" DocumentRoot tree.
>How-To-Repeat:
Ckeck SSI with commented & uncommented <VirtualHost ..> host tags.

httpd.conf:
## <VirtualHost eskola1.hfd.hr:80>
DocumentRoot /var/www1
....
## </VirtualHost>

access.conf:

<Directory>
Options Includes ....
XBitHack on
...
</Directory>

State-Changed-Why:
Please read the docs for the "Directory" directive.
"<Directory>" without listing any directory isn't valid.
You need to have your Options directive that enables includes
inside a Directory secion that applies to the part of the
filesystem that covers th evhost.

 If I remove comments from VirualHost in httpd.conf
 includes DO NOT work. They are treated as ordinary HTML comments.
