 Back of "THE NET" :: WYSL Silent Sunday
 ...........................................................
  
 Positive Coaching Workshops to be held in February
 
 Leaders and coaches of all youth sports from nearby communities are invited 
 
 Scarsdale, New York - January 24, 2002 - 
 The following letter was received from Rip Fisher, 
 President Emeritus, Scarsdale Youth Soccer Club, and a 
 director of the Westchester Youth Soccer League and 
 is reprinted here with his permission.  The BOTN thanks 
 Rip and the WYSL for their input and comments on POW 
 
 The Westchester Youth Soccer League held its 
 first "Silent Sunday" last fall in September, which was 
 similar to what is planned in Long Island in April.  The 
 goal was to give the game back to the players for at 
 least one Sunday.  The feedback we received from 
 coaches, players and their parents was overwhelmingly 
 positive, although there was a small minority of parents 
 and coaches that missed their ability to "actively 
 participate" in the game themselves.
 
 Based on our positive first experience, the WYSL is 
 going to have another "Silent Sunday" this spring.  
 Based on our fall experience, we are going to avoid the 
 first week or two of the season so that new teams and 
 coaches can get several games under the belts before 
 giving the players the freedom and responsibility to run 
 one game largely for themselves.   We are also going to 
 try and do more to publicize the event in advance so 
 that some parents do not learn about it just before the 
 game.
 
 Many coaches and parents were surprized how much 
 more on field communication they heard from the 
 players.  While this may be common with older teams, 
 we had many comments from U-12, U-11 and even U-
 10 teams that players stepped up and took a more 
 active leadership role in their games.
 
 WYSL to have another Silent Sunday this Spring
 
 The WYSL is also aware of the benefits to the game if 
 we can improve the sideline participation to be more 
 positive and supportive.  The WYSL and a number of its 
 member clubs are holding a series of workshops in 
 February that are being offered by the Positive 
 Coaching Alliance, a non-profit educational organization 
 based at Stanford University.  The goal of these 
 workshops is to help coaches become double-goal 
 coaches, coaches who want to win but who also want 
 to develop character in their players.  Coaches and 
 soccer officials from Long Island or elsewhere are 
 welcome to attend these workshops, the details of 
 which are included in the attached Flyer.  Further 
 information on the Positive Coaching Alliance is 
 available at www.positivecoach.org.
