Subject: SuExec doesn't allow LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be a part of "safe_env_lst"

DEC C V5.6-071
>Description:
I wanted my users to be able to use two environment variables so that they could use
DBD::Oracle. LD_LIBRARY_PATH and ORACLE_HOME. Also want to use SuExec. The two environment
variables are set in httpd.conf as SetEnv directives. These environment variables
work fine on the share/cgi-bin scripts but don't get passed to user cgi-bin scripts.
>How-To-Repeat:
Modify src/support/suexec.c as follows:

char *safe_env_lst[] =
{
/* add in the following two entries
    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH",
    "ORACLE_HOME",

Recompile with suexec support.
Edit httpd.conf and add:

SetEnv ORACLE_HOME foo
SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH bar

and see what environment variables you get from a simple env.cgi script in both 
the share/cgi-bin dir and a user dir.

#!/bin/sh
echo content-type:text/html
echo
echo "<pre>"
env

The share/cgi-bin/env.cgi script should show both LD_LIBRARY_PATH and ORACLE_HOME.

The userdir env.cgi seems to show ORACLE_HOME but not LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

>Fix:
I tried modifying the c source for suexec, and found that I could get ORACLE_HOME
throught to user CGI scripts, but not LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Is there something else
somewhere that is blocking LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

 I have fixed the problem... for some reason adding LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 to the safe_env_lst array did not allow the LD_LIBRARY_PATH var through
 to the CGI environment.
 
 I further modified the suexec.c code to push the LD_LIBRARY_PATH into
 the cleanenv array.
 
 static void clean_env(void)
 {
   char pathbuf[512];
 >  char libpathbuf[512]; < added this line
 
 then later...
 
 sprintf(libpathbuf,"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%s","/usr/oracle/lib");
 cleanenv[cidx]=strdup(libpathbuf);
 cidx++;
 
 cleanenv[cidx] = NULL;
 environ = cleanenv;
 }
 
 int main...... 
 
 Please let me know if this is a good/bad fix, or any better ways to fix
 this problem!

State-Changed-Why:
The whole point of the restriction of what environment
variables can be passed to CGIs is to stop things like
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  It is a security hole to allow LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to be passed through, because it means that if someone can
get access to the UID that can run suexec then they can
execute arbitrary (ie. not just set CGIs) code as any user
that suexec will use.
