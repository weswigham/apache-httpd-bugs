I use Windows 98.
>Description:
I downloaded and installed "apache_1_3_9_win32.exe" from
your site, then tried to open Apache from the start menu by choosing "Start Apache."
A console window appeared with a prompt to connect to the internet.  I chose
"cancel" on this prompt because I know that I need not be connected to the internet
in order to run a web server.  Then the console window just disappeared!  The reason I chose to use Apache is because it was
recommended for use with Cold Fusion 4.0.
When I installed Apache, I let it install everything into the default directories.
I previously attempted to use Microsoft Personal Webserver 1.0a (the only one I 
could find), but then uninstalled it and installed Apache instead.

I would GREATLY appreciate any help you could provide in getting Apache to work
for me!
