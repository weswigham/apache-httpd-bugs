>Environment:
Redhat 6.0, Blackdown jdk 1.1.7v3, InstantDB && NT 4 wt. IBM jdk 1.1.7 && IBM UDB
>Description:
JServ seems to lose the plot with some JDBC drivers.  The latest I've seen it
was using InstantDB (http://www.instantdb.co.uk) on Linux.  The URL includes 
the path to a properties file (jdbc:idb:/path/to/prop_file) and altho the 
property file was found & loaded, within it were properties that were directories
& files.  Whether specified relatively or absolutely, these directories could
not be found & a FileNotFoundException gets thrown by the driver.

When I last submitted this I hadn't made the connection with a similar problem
at work.  I had attempted to set up JServ on my laptop to run our servlet product
which uses IBM's UDB at the back end.  I was unable to get it to work, since
an UnsatisfiedLinkError was thrown by the driver - it was unable to find native
code in the path to use the driver, even tho my paths had been set up the same
as the servers'.  I had assumed it was a configuration problem until it was 
duplicated when we attempted to install & configure JServ on the server.

It appears that when running under JServ, JDBC drivers are not able to resolve
paths correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
The quickest way is to download & install InstantDB (its all Java), use their
sample database, write some quick code to create a connection to it & run it
in a servlet. (http://www.instantdb.co.uk)
