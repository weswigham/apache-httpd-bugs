>Description:
Apache 1.3.14 server installed, configured as follows:

  ./configure --prefix=/opt/apache --disable-module=include
     --enable-module=so

It appeared to be working fine, but then my users started complaining 
that their web site's .pdf files weren't being rendered properly. 
I could not reproduce the problem on my PC, using Win 98 & IE 5.5, but 
I verified the problem on an NT 4.0 box w/ IE 5.0. The problem was
intermittent; after clicking a link to an Acrobat 4.0 .pdf file about
6-8 times, I would get either pure ASCII displayed on the screen or the
browser would hang. Others were reporting that users of their web sites
were having trouble printing .pdf files. I took the server down and 
replaced it with Apache 1.3.12, and all is well at this point. The 1.3.12
server wouldn't start with my 1.3.14 httpd.conf file, so I can't determine
if the problem was in that file. I'm sorry I don't have more info. for 
you, but this server is now in production and I can't keep taking it down
for testing purposes.
>How-To-Repeat:
I believe it may have more to do with the client machine/browser than with
any particular .pdf file. As I said, I could not reproduce the problem on 
my PC/browser.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm closing this report because it is a duplicate of #6711.
I have been unable to reproduce the problem, so if you can
add to PR#6711 an example URL that exhibits it that would
be helpful. Thanks.
