>Description:
my apache based web server can not accessed sometimes when I use my dial-up form home. 
The server is hosted by a major network provider whose has re-assured me that
nothing is wrong with their network nor with my machine (apache server and linux)
when I reported to them the problem (It was checked simultaneously).
The only strange message I found is my error_logs where I see the following message
repeated many times: "socket connection refused - connection reset by peer".
What does this mean ??
Is this the problem ??? 

Thank you for your time.

State-Changed-Why:
You really have to define "cannot access".  Can you ping
the box when the problem is happening?  Can you telnet
to port 80 on it?  Can the provider access the web
server when you can't?

Are you sure that 
"socket connection refused - connection reset by peer" is
the _exact_ error message you are getting?  What do you
mean by "repeated many times"?  Does this happen all
the time, or just when you can't access it?

This could very easily be a linux problem.  You are using
quite an old version that has a good number of known
bugs.

It is unlikely that we can do anything at all without more
information.

 Subject: Apache inaccessibility
 
 (sorry I forgot to write the message on my previous mail)
 
 Thank you for your answer.
 
 Here is some additional information incase you can figure out what's
 happening.
 Using my dial-up from home I can NOT ping, finger, telnet (not to port
 80 nor port 23), ftp, or use the web on my site.
 At the same time the server is accessible by the provider (they were
 calling it while I could not access it).
 
 The exact message reads:
 
 - socket error: accept failed
 accept: Connection reset by peer
 
 This message appearrs only while I can not access the server.
 
 Another strange thing that I have noticed is that when I was not able to
 access the server, I called my provider and told them to check oin my
 machine. The pinged the machine and got the message "alive" meaning that
 the server was o.k. After that moment I was aslo able to access it.
 Could it be that the server is "asleep" is some way and that their call
 woke him up ? Is there such a capability for linux machines ??
 
 Thank you for your concern.

 If you can't access it at all, then it has nothing to do with Apache.  If
 your provider can access it then the problem is most likely a network
 problem between you and your provider.

 This is a possible problem, but given the other information there is
 something more going on that isn't related to Apache.  Upgrading your
 system to use the latest 2.0.x kernel would be a good start.

 Unlikely.  It would be more likely that your provider would be lying to
 you, and they would find and fix the problem when you called.
 
 There isn't really much we can do, since this is almost certainly not an
 Apache problem.
