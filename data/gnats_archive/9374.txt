State-Changed-Why:
Pretty scanty detail of what Apache version you are trying.  We are 
developing the 2.0.30 release, forthcoming.  The last release was .28,
so I will guess you are there.  Several known bugs in Win9x ports, and
several that haven't been debugged just yet (may be fixed in .30, and
then again, may not.)

We don't have many Win9x hackers contributing to the project, and much 
of the Windows hackers' efforts have been in optimizing the Windows NT port.
Sorry, but that is the nature of open source development, and we always
entertain patches that resolve bugs when users identify the invalid source 
code and come up with a fix.

Anyways, there are several patches to 2.0.30 that already solve some
very detailed bug reports for Windows 9x, and more being researched,
so please try out version .30 when it's released, and continue to use
Apache 1.3.22 on Windows 9x for production.

Thanks for participating in the Apache 2.0 Beta!

State-Changed-Why:
Without further feedback we can't help much.

However, a significant bug was discovered in files that
spanned 8kb ... depending on circumstance the seek function
was not repositioning the file pointer correctly.  That could
explain your problem.

That bug is fixed in the forthcoming 2.0.34.  Thanks for
trying the Apache 2.0 Beta!
