>Release:        1.2.0-1
>Environment:
OS: BSDI 2.1 patchlevel 27
Compiler: gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
When some of my users request specifics URLs, the httpd process dealing with the
request grows fast until it uses 100% CPU. The request never finishes, the page
is not served, and the server cannot answer other requests (because of the CPU).
This only happens on a few URLs, but it's enough to make the server almost
unusable.
Examples of such URLS are:
http://wwwperso.hol.fr/~toumouss/bigbear/pics/geocitiz.jpg
http://wwwperso.hol.fr/~xgerbeau/jardin/up_level.gif
If I rename the file, the problem disappears. If I copy the file, remove the
original and rename the copy to the original, the problem remains. So this is
not a problem with my disk/filesystem (I can cat the file).
I don't have a rewrite rule that could possibly apply to those names.
The server has been running without any problem with the same config for the
past two months.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know how to repeat this problem. On my server, there's no problem, but
when accessing the same path on another server, everything is OK.
>Fix:
The temporary fix I use is to have a watchdog kill httpd processes that grow too
much, but that's not a viable solution

State-Changed-Why:
What you say doesn't entirely make sense; one process
eating 100% CPU should not stop other processes from serving
requests due to the fact that Unix is an operating system,
unlike Windows.

Can you reproduce the problem 100% of the time?  Try
cutting your config files to the minimum possible.  If you
have mod_rewrite compiled into your server, try temporarily
removing it and recompiling.  Try compiling with a minimum of modules.

Try running a ktrace on the runaway process (eg. ktrace -p
666, then ktrace -C to stop it, then kdump to dump the
output) to see what it is doing.

 Ok, I've found the problem, you can close this ticket.
 The problem was the counter module (webcounter 1.1). It seems it couldn't 
 update the database for the newest pages, probably an internal limit as to
 the number of references it can keep.
 I've disabled it until I find a solution.
 
 PS: A process eating 100% CPU does not stop other processes from serving 
 pages, but it sure slows them down a lot.
