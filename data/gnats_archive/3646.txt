>Environment:
Linux 2.0.36
Apache 1.3.3
Apache JServ 1.0b1
>Description:
I alias a servlet and give it some properties in <zone>.properties. Works great.
Then, with autoreload.file turned on, I change the properties in <zone>.properties.
It doesn't autoreload them.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow the steps I give above.
>Fix:
Probably fix the confFile variable in JServServletManager to point to the <zone>.properties file.
