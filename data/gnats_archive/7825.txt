>Environment:
OS: Windows 95
Downloaded compiled Apache exe from www.apache.org
>Description:
I'm running Apache server under Windows95 and I want to make url:
http://www.myserver.com/test
to automatically use URL 
http://www.myserver.com/test/index.cgi
it DOES work under Linux, but it does not work under Win95 - the best I can get is "FORBIDDEN". I do not want to use meta refresh and redirect to http://www.myserver.com/test/cgi/index.cgi
>How-To-Repeat:
I've been using such a lines in httpd.conf:

  ScriptAlias /test/ "c:/www/test/"
  <Directory "c:/www/test">
      DirectoryIndex index.cgi
      Options ExecCGI
  </Directory>
>Fix:
Sorry, no.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
