>Description:
I noticed that mod_jserv creates a number of sockets which have TIME_WAIT status,
though mod_jserv is working properly. I get 80 sockets with TIME_WAIT status on
Solaris 7 and this number settles down to 80. Please find a subset of the
"netstat -a" output below.

Could you please let me know if this is behaviour is normal and why the number
of sockets settles down to 80. I don't recall this huge number of sockets
when using Apache-1.0

I would be grateful for any info.

Thanks,

Thierry.
