>Description:
When using .htaccess to provide custom error documents using the 
ErrorDocument directives, and browsing with MS Internet Explorer
release 5, with the "friendly HTTP error messages" setting enabled,
the .htacess file is skipped.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use IE5 with the setting off and then on and access http://mencik.com/test.html which does not exist. Notice the difference.

Now, the script that I use checks if the file not found ends in ".htm"
or ".html" and tries again with the ".shtml" ending. I did this because
I changed all my files to use SSI for statistics purposes. Anyway, try
accessing http://mencik.com/bs.html and with the "firendly error messages"
turned off, the server will check the .htaccess file and will deliver
the http://mencik.com/bs.shtml file. If you access http://mencik.com/bs.html
with "friendly error messages" turned on, you will get the "friendly error
message" instead of the correct page.
>Fix:
My guess is that the server is returning the error code to the client before
checking the .htaccess file. Normally the client does nothing with this,
waiting instead for the server to return the error document. That gives the
server time to check the .htaccess file and follow the script. With the
smarter client, it uses that error code to provide it's own message, and doesn't
wait for the server. Suggest that if this is the case, the error code should
not be returned until after the .htacess directives are processed.

Nope, this is entirely the fualt of the client.  Please
complain to Microsoft.

More to the point, you are doing the redirect by putting
a meta tag in the body.  Don't do that!  Just do a proper
HTTP redirect and the client can read it.

Alternatively, if you make your files large enough by padding
them with something, IE will display them.

 I have complained to Microsoft. They claim it is Apache's problem.
 Their solution is to turn off "friendly error messages". Unfortunately,
 I cannot tell all potential customers to do that! Hopefully the developers
 from Apache can talk to their counterparts at Microsoft and straighten
 this out. You should have a lot more clout with them than I do.
 
 As for the redirect statements, is it possible within .htaccess to
 redirect *.htm to the equivalent *.shtml? If not, then the solution
 I chose is the best way to do what I want, without a whole slew of
 Redirect statements in the .htaccess file. Or are you saying that I
 should have a "Location:" field in my returned document instead
 of using the META tag method?
 
 Thanks for your help.
