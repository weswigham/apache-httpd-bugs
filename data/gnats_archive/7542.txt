>Description:
Create a user account, http://localhost/~user/  From the user's default directory "Sites" on my machine, create a link to another directory belonging to user (ln -s ~/Documents/Humor in my example)  When I open the web browser to http://localhost/~user, I see the contents or the "Sites" directory, but the link to "Humor" responds with Error 403.

Note, I can follow links from http://localhost/ to directories located on a completely different hard drive.

Here is the contents of user.conf:
<Directory "/Users/dave/">
    Options Indexes Multiviews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

I have tried all sorts of combination of chmod and chgrp on the problem directories, but apache still won't follow.

>How-To-Repeat:
I posted this problem on Apple's discussion board.  One person replied saying he tried to do what I wanted, and could not do it either.  He claimed to spend an hour trying.

I found several other similar situations in the bug reports here, but no solutions.  One stated that if any <directory> does not have Options FollowSymLinks, then apache won't, but I can't find anything missing.
>Fix:
No.

  From my /etc/httpd/hpptd.conf file.........
 .

 .
 DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
 
 <Directory />
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride None
 </Directory>
 
 <Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents">
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews

 For a while today, I was wondering if the AllowOveride None line might be 
 the culprit.  I'm knew at this, but I am again of the opinion that it has 
 no effect.

State-Changed-Why:
No obvious configuration error, someone needs to look at what is going on under this particular OS and verify if this is a bug.
