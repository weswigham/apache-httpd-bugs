State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Jul 10 14:47:21 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The name you give is a cname for tom_cat.cbdata.com.br.
"_" is not a valid character for a hostname, so the
FreeBSD resolver libraries refuse to deal with it.
You will find that trying to telnet to the host from
the FreeBSD box will result in it not being found either.

The fix is to either hack your FreeBSD box so it understands
names with underscores in (requires a source change)
or you get them to fix their broken hostname and remove
the "_".
