>Description:
I was playing around with date.php3 of the example installation and wrote
following php3-file:

<HTML>
<BODY>
<?echo date("D M d, Y H:i:s", time())?><BR>
<?echo gmdate("D M d, Y H:i:s", time())?><BR>
</BODY>
</HTML>

My time zone is Europe/Berlin, currently Central Europa Daylight Savings Time (CEST)
When I continously reload the URL

http://kult.stura.uni-leipzig.de/date/now.php3

I get diverting results. Sometimes both lines are the same and sometimes they
differ by 2 hours, as it should be. Using the "date" command I could not make
out such behaviour so I suspect apache or php3 to be the buggy code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try continously reload that URL

http://kult.stura.uni-leipzig.de/date/now.php3

let's say for at least 10 times. Usually there will be a change after about
3 reloads.
>Fix:
I do not have any suggestions than simply fixing that bug.

State-Changed-Why:

This is almost certainly a mod_php bug.  Please report it
to the support path for that module, unless you can
reproduce it somehow under base Apache without using PHP.
Thanks for using Apache!
