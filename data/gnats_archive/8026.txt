>Description:
I have tried to set up protected irectories in the httpd.conf file using:
<Directory "/name/of/directory">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName " "
        AuthUserFile /name/of/non/accessable/dir/.passwdfile
        require valid-user
</Directory>

Worked fine the first time, the second time, but the third time did not. When I have investigated deeper, it seems that now all directories I have protected are accessable by only first two users (one for the first dir, and the one for the second dir). I have created separate password files using htpasswd. I have restarted/reloaded the server. Even if I rename/delete the password files, still the same users have access to all dirs that are protected this way.

Does Apache somehow cache these passwords? What can I do to flush this cache?

Upgrade of Apache is currently out of question on this machine.

I was thinking even of rebooting the whole server to completlu flush the memory, but this is obviously kludge solution.

State-Changed-Why:
I am sorry, but if, as I suspect, you are using the
version of Apache distributed with the RAQ3/whatever,
then we really can't help you.  This version has
been modified to authenticate from the system password
file, and we know nothing about how this works or does
not work.

Sorry, but you'll have to contact whomever gave you
this distribution of Apache (Cobalt/Sun/whomever).
