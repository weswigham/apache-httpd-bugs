>Description:
I guess this is a wish-it-were-this-way bug.
I did not have the includes option correctly set in access.conf, and the error
mesage in the log was 'handler server-parsed not found, using defualt' ...
something like 'option Include not set for /var/www, using default handler'
would have shortened the time I spent figuring it out.
picky, huh?

State-Changed-Why:

This is a generic error message and not just for
the server-parsed handler or the Includes option.
I'm afraid it is very unlikely that we will change
this.

But thanks for your report.
