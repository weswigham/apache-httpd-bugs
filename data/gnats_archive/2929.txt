windows NT workstation 4.0 SP3
>Description:
Following the recommandations , I've upgraded from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1 
on a Windows NT 4.0 sp3 system.
I've followed the indication in PR 2876, but it's still not working
and the Service ConTrol Manager indicates errors.
I could try to re-install from scratch but do I have to remove
something with regedit before ?

 I've discussed this problem with Ken Coar.
 
 In fact, there is a problem when upgrading from one version to another
 one because of the registry. If you deinstall the software first, you
 have to save your configuration files.
 
 So there is something to do when upgrading on an NT system and to
 improve the mechanism.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Daniel Clar
