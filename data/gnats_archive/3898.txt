>Description:
I'm trying to build/install apache in a "shareable" fashion, where the SW is
installed to (in my case) /Packages/Linux-ix86/apache-1.3.4, but is accessed
via /usr/local/* - this is managed by using cmu-depot.

Usually (mainly other gnu-autoconf kits) it's sufficient to do a "configure --prefix=/usr/local ..."
followed my a "make" and then a "make install prefix=/Packages/Linux-ix86/apache-1.3.4",
however the Apache-kit ignores the "prefix=.." in the "make install .." command,
and trying to use "configure --prefix=/Packages/Linux-ix86/apache-1.3.4
--exec-prefix=/usr/local" results in some of the stuff (mainly the support-tools)
going directly to /usr/local, while the rest goes where it's supposed to go.

The problem is compounded by the fact that the /usr/local hierarchy is strictly
maintained by cmu-depot, which means that stuff that hasn't been added by cmu-depot
simply gets deleted.

Not a serious problem, but definately an annoying one (to me at least ;-) )

 What you're searching for is "make install root=....", I guess.
 Look inside the INSTALL file for details.
