State-Changed-Why:
You need to be a lot more specific.  Exactly what did you
enter to try to configure it?  Exactly what error did you get
at exactly what stage?  ie. cut and paste was invented for
a reason...

 I downloaded this file apache_1.3.9.tar.gz from apache.org
 I uncompressed it in the directory /usr/local
 I read the INSTALL file 
 I tried to intall using APACI
 so i executed the script configure in the directory the /usr/local/apache_1.3.9 
 it gave the following error
 #./configure
 Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.9
  + Warning: Configuring Apache with default settings.
  + This is probably not what you really want.
  + Please read the README.configure and INSTALL files
  + first or at least run './configure --help' for
  + a compact summary of available options.
  + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
 Creating Makefile
 Creating Configuration.apaci in src
 Creating Makefile in src
  + configured for Linux platform
  + setting C compiler to gcc
  + setting C pre-processor to NOT-AVAILABLE
  + checking for system header files
  + adding selected modules
  + checking sizeof various data types
  + doing sanity check on compiler and options
 ** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
 ** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
 ** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
 ** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
 ** will also provide a clue.
  Aborting!
 
 I think this would be sufficient.. 
 thanks in advance..
