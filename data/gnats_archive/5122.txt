>Description:
* When using a non-default compiler (in my case a version of egcs)
apxs does not fill in $CFG_LD_SHLIB which causes a subquent failure.
* In addition, apxs checks $CFG_LD_SHLIB against "gcc" (line 385).
>How-To-Repeat:
env CC=/opt/egcs/bin/gcc ./configure --enable-module=so
Then afterwards build php --with-apxs=...
>Fix:
1. Either configure should set LD_SHLIB to CC if undefined or
apxs should do so.
2. Instead of checking against "gcc" apxs should check against
the equivalent of `basename $CFG_LD_SHLIB`
