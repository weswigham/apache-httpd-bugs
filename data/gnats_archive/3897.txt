Linux dragon 2.2.1 #1 Wed Feb 3 14:41:10 GMT+0200 1999 i686 unknown
gcc version 2.7.2.3   elf, glibc 2.0.7
>Description:
I'm trying to upgrade from 1.2.0 to 1.3.4.  The compile is fine, but 1.3.4 will
not start.  It starts, as usual, but dies without error, as seen here:

dragon:/usr/local/apache/bin# apachectl start
././apachectl: kill: (31663) - No such pid
././apachectl start: httpd started
dragon:/usr/local/apache/bin# apachectl start
././apachectl: kill: (31710) - No such pid
././apachectl start: httpd started

It is apparently exiting normally:

dragon:/usr/local/apache/bin# gdb httpd
(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd

Program exited normally.
         
I did a completely new install, even so far as resorting to the dist config file,
with the same results.

Is there anything in the error log?

What does strace-ing httpd while starting it do?

 Hi Marc,
 
 Thanks for the quick reply.

 Alright, being more awake I decided to do an strace -f this time, which
 shows a segfault.  I added in a sleep and gdb'd the child process (the
 detached parent) and it seems to be dying during the return from
 set_signals() called from standalone_main():
 
 (gdb) info break

 (gdb)
 Continuing.

 (its not reaching line 4275, the first line after returning)
 
 something i forgot to mention previously is that 1.2.0 was compiled libc5,
 and 1.3.4 glibc.  could this be a library problem?
 
 Thanks,
 Gaven

Yeah it could totally be a library problem.  If you installed
glibc over top a libc5 system I'd suspect the installation.  If
it's a fresh glibc system... dunno.  I've never been happy
with any attempts to make libc5 and glibc dev environments
co-exist -- it's just not worth the headaches.
