State-Changed-Why:

Without significantly more information, there is no way
we can analyze this further.  You don't mention the specific
subversion (1.3.??) of apache, or what other binaries are
running, including loaded apache modules.

I'd suggest this is an interaction between apache's mode
of providing an invisible service.  Please use the cmd

apache -k uninstall -n apache

to remove the service, and run apache as a console program
instead.
