>Description:
I have built Apache 1.3.17 as an upgrade from 1.3.14. 
Extra :
* suexec
* mod_ssl 2.8.0 [with openssl 0.9.6]
* mod_perl 1.25
* PHP 4.0.4pl1 
* Improved mod_frontpage 15.0-1.3.17 [and 1.4.1-1.3.14 --> http://home.edo.uni-dortmund.de/~chripo/]
* [with and with mod_auth_mysql 2.20] --> _copied_ src/include/ap_alloc.h to src/include/alloc.h for this reason

Apache/1.3.17 (Unix) mod_perl/1.25 PHP/4.0.4pl1 mod_ssl/2.8.0 OpenSSL/0.9.6 FrontPage/4.0.4.3

The problem is this :

If i restrict access to a / [root] directory, it works fine. If I however restrict access to /some_subdir, I get an error that the host is not responding, a TCP/IP error.

Configged mod_perl with this config-option :
perl Makefile.PL APACHE_SRC=../apache_1.3.17/src EVERYTHING=1 PERL_AUTHEN=1 PERL_ACCESS=1 PERL_AUTHZ=1 USE_APACI=1

And added to the Apache-config:
--activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile the above config, and try to restrict access to a subdirectory :

AuthUserFile /opt/guide/www.maddog2k.nl/admin/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName "Admin"
AuthType Basic  
require valid-user
>Fix:
No....unfortunately not. I suspected mod_auth_mysql 2.20, but it wasn't. I suspected then mod_frontpage, but it wasn't. Then mod_perl, and it _was_ 
So there's something wrong with this one. I don't know in which way to report _this_ kind of bugs, but I do it at both sites.

It _does_ work on Apache 1.3.17 with PHP4.0.4pl1 (w/o suexec) @ RedHat 6.2
