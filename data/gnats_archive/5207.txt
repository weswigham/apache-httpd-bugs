>Release:        Apache 1.3.9, Apache JServ-1.1-b2_RH6x.i386
>Environment:
Redhat Linux 6.1. Using either JDK117_v3 or JDK1.2, Apache 1.3.9, ApacheJServ1.1b2, and either mm.mysql.jdbc or twz1jdbc.
>Description:
Get various errors trying to connect to JDBC. Currently running mm.mysql.jdbc-1.2. 
Registering Driver with DriverManager directly as I heard that not doing so can
cause a problem connecting to the driver. I get "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/gjt/mm/mysql/Driver" 
in Jserv.log.  My CLASSPATH includes jdk1.2/jre/lib/rt.jar, ....jsdk.jar and
..../mm.mysql.jdbc-1.2b.

The line of code that is "hanging" is:

DriverManager.registerDriver(new org.gjt.m.mysql.Driver());

That is the only place in the code where I reference the full path to the Driver class.

I get the same problem when I use the tzFM drivers instead.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I'm not sure where the problem is coming from. I know the Apache JServ jar file has 
the org/ path. Is there a conflict if Jserv's classpath and JDBC's classpath both
begin with org.? Other than that, I'm stumped.
