nt2000 sp1
>Description:
I have tried to install apache on an nt2000 workstation sp1. (256 mb ram)
I think Internet information service is installed and I wonder whether this is not what is blocking the Apache system. (visual studio.net is installed as a beta) I have not found any reference to this service in the service window.

Otherwise nothing special with the machine.

I installed apache as a service to force it to run and got then the above message.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Is there any way to see if internet information service is running

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
