>Environment:
2.0.32 binary from apache.org
mod_ssl.so compile by Visual C++ 6.0 sp4 in Windows 2000 english version
with open_SSL 0.9.6c
Run in Windows XP english version
>Description:
If the ouput content size is too large, the Apache will crash, both the child process and parent process.

For example, if I try to download a 5MB file.
The apache will try to output something, but the browser can only get 32KB/64KB.
And then the Apache itself crash.
>How-To-Repeat:
I can always repeat it easily.
The same problem seem exist in 2.0.28. But the maximium usable content size is bigger in 2.0.28. But in 2.0.28, the crash point seems change case by case.
But in 2.0.32, the crash point seems always be 32KB and 64KB.
