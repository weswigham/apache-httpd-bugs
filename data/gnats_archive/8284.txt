State-Changed-When: Mon Sep  3 11:12:50 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
You don't mention which subversion of Apache... upgrade to 1.3.20 if you haven't.

It is _remotely_ possible that XP is treating the socket connection in 'text' mode.

It's far more likely you are running it through some module or script that opens the 
file in text mode, or you have something else installed (even if it was installed by XP 
without your knowledge.)

Again, something is munging your files.  The Apache core (1.3.20) ALWAYS sends content 
without any text/binary translation.

How is your server configured?  Can you download the icons in /images/ without any problem?
Are you _certain_ Apache is the server answering the request (look at the headers.)

Finally, just try (from the local machine) requesting http://10.0.0.1/ (or whatever your
own IP address is) instead of http://localhost/ or http://127.0.0.1/, since these will
go through the loopback adapter you tell us already works correctly, while 10.0.0.1 (or whatever your IP address is)
will go through your network adapter and any additional
products you have installed on your PC.
