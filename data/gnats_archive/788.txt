>Environment:
Linux 2.0.31-pre-2, gcc 2.7.2.2, libc5-5.4.23, binutils-2.8.1.
Distribution: Debian 1.2, upgraded to 1.3 (via the packaging system).
>Description:
(1) mod_dld doesn't work - I have dlfcn.h but no dld.h

(2) Virtual hosting is broken if a Host: header is passed containing the
    short form of the hostname (i.e., 'web' as opposed to 'web.dom.ain').
    Also, with HTTP/1.0 it seems broken - with no Host: I get the wrong
    one, even if I connected to an interface (from another machine) that
    has a <VirtualHost> entry in httpd.conf.

I probably did something terribly wrong so feel free to ignore. :)
However, the first problem would qualify as not-so-good so I'll leave
the severity to "serious"
>How-To-Repeat:
telnet webserver 80
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: web

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: web

GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: web.virtual.domain

GET / HTTP/1.0
[empty line]

The first two and the latter give the wrong ServerRoot index.html
>Fix:
I'd check it out better if I had more time... if you need any specifics,
feel free to mail.

With regards,

State-Changed-Why:
mod_dld isn't supported everywhere ... and probably doesn't
really even work in 1.2.0 anyhow.

There's nothing the server can do if the client passes it a
hostname of just "web" rather than a fully-qualified hostname.
It can't guess the information ... if you want to support unqualified
names then you could use ServerAlias.

 You can't get the old behaviour back.  It was hopelessly broken pre-1.1 by
 the addition of the name-based virtual hosts.  There's a bunch of
 documentation that describes workarounds.  I know it's hopelessly broken
 because I've spent far too much time trying to make it work, and plan on
 rewriting vhost support entirely. 
 
 If you've got a <VirtualHost> that matches the ip of the machine that your
 server is on then it will have this undesirable new behaviour.  To work
 around it you can use:
 
 <VirtualHost _default_:*>
 ServerName whatever
 </VirtualHost>
 
 in place of your previous <VirtualHost>.
 
 Or you could place "ServerName localhost" outside of all <VirtualHost>
 sections, which fools apache into thinking that 127.0.0.1 is the address
 that it's supposed to do name-based vhost matching.
