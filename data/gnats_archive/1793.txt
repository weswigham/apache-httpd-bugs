>Description:
If I connect to my Apache server like this:
GET /foo.zip HTTP/1.0
Accept: text/html

It happily sends me the application/zip and even gives the content
type as application/zip.  IIRC, earlier versions refused to serve the
file, which strikes me as the right thing to do.

Comment-Added:
This is a protocol issue rather than a mod_negotiation one,
so I've recategorised it.  Please don't reply to any
messages with a subject containing "mod_negotiation/1793",
only to those with "protocol/1793".

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, the is unfortunately the current behaviour of Apache.
If you request a document which exists on the disk with
the same name, the negotiation algorithm is *NOT* applied.
In this case, foo.zip exists, so Apache returns is despite
the Accept: header. This is not really correct, so hopefully
a later version of Apache will fix this, by always applying
the Accept* headers to all requests.

In the meantime, the only way to get this to work is to
force mod_negotiation to kick in the negotiation algorithm.
This can be done in one of two ways:

  - either enable MultiViews (Options +Multi), then request
    the URL without the extension (e.g. GET /foo HTTP/1.0).
    This is a performance implication because now Apache
    will do a search for files called /foo.* to perform
    the negotiation

  or

  - enable "type-map" files (AddHandle type-map var), then
    create a type-map for (say) resource foo - create a file
    called foo.var containing

URI: z.zip
Content-Type: application/zip

  Now make requests for /foo.var instead of /foo.zip.

This is documented in /manual/content-negotiation.html on any
Apache mirror site.
