>Environment:
Windows NT 4, using Developer Studio 5.0
>Description:
During the compilation of the mod_rewrite module, the compiler finds the following error:
src\modules\standard\mod_rewrite.c(3197) : error C2167: 'strcat' : too many actual parameters for intrinsic function
This error appears via a command-line compilation, or via a Release compilation through the DevStudio environment.

The Debug compilation through DevStudio environment is able to complete with a simple warning:
src\modules\standard\mod_rewrite.c(3197) : warning C4020: 'strcat' : too many actual parameters
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The code probably expects an ap_strcat call instead of strcat.
