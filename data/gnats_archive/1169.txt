State-Changed-Why:
Are you saying it never works or that it only works
sometimes?

Have you added or removed any modules to the Configuration
file before compiling?  Have you modified the config files
much from the distributed versions?

Do you have gcc available?  If so, try that.

Do you know how to use a debugger or if there is one
installed on your system?  If so, using it to examine
the core file could tell where the problem is occuring.
