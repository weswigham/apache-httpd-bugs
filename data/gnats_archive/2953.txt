Trying to get access to all the directories (from root down) on the drive on which Apache is installed is failing. I am using exactly the same settings in my conf files for other drives (local and network) with no problem.

Error log shows:
[Fri Sep 04 12:08:11 1998] file .\os\win32\util_win32.c, line 66, assertion "s >= szFile && "this is a known bug"" failed

(Reverse of PR 1558?)
>How-To-Repeat:
httpd.conf:
   ServerRoot D:/apache
srm.conf:
   Alias /droot/ d:
   Alias /croot/ c:
access.conf:
   <Directory D:/>
   allow from all
   Options Indexes
   </Directory>
   <Directory C:/>
   allow from all
   Options Indexes
   </Directory>

URL = http://myserver/croot/ work okay
URL = http://myserver/droot/ fails with "connection with the server was reset"

Try using "Alias /xyz/ c:/" (note the trailing slash).

 Amended the alias to  Alias /droot/ d:/  but this produced a directory listing
 for the Apache sub-directory (together with the Readme file), NOT the root
 directory.  (Note that Apache is installed on drive d:.)

 [...]
 I have found the cause of the problem. It is not in the settings in the conf
 files, but the way that the server is fired up. I have left the conf files as
 before (i.e. no trailing slash):
 
   Alias /droot/ d:
   Alias /croot/ c:
   <Directory D:/>
     allow from all
     Options Indexes
   </Directory>
   <Directory C:/>
     allow from all
     Options Indexes
   </Directory>
 
 However, I made a simple change to the way in which the server is invoked from
 the Windows icon: the "Start in" property was set to "D:\apache" by default,
 and
 I changed it to "D:\".
 
 Everything is now working as expected.

(One of the windows people should check this stuff with

State-Changed-Why:
There are/were two problems here.

First, when using the Alias directive on Win32, be sure
to specify the root of the drive with a trailing slash
(e.g. x:/).  If you do not, and use 'x:' instead, Windows
will try to use the "current path on drive x:", not the 
root.  This is normal Windows/DOS behavior, and hence why
changing the "Start in" seems to fix the problem.

Second, PR 3001 pointed out that Apache Win32 was not 
getting to the root drive correctly, and this PR was
suffering from the same bug once the Alias was changed
to use a trailing slash.  This problem has been fixed
and committed to CVS and should be available in the 
next release of Apache.

Once you have received the version of Apache with the
fix for 3001, I recommend leaving the "Start in" 
as the D:\apache directory, and defining the Alias
directives with a trailing slash.  

Thanks for using Apache!
