>Environment:
Linux 2.0.30, GCC 2.7.2.2
>Description:
If using multiple HTTP/1.1 GET requests on single connection to retrieve
data from different virtual hosts, the virtual host list is scanned starting
with the most recently used VH, not with the first one which causes that most VH's
are ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
GET / HTTP/1.1, Host: first_virtual_host; GET / HTTP/1.1, Host: primary_server_name
>Fix:
Set current_conn->server back to the original value after each call to read_request
from the http_main main loop

 Yep that would be the correct fix.  This whole vhost mechanism really
 needs an overhaul, this like bug #934561 with it.
 
 Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
A patch along the lines you suggested has been added to Apache 
for the next release (1.2b11). A full re-write of the virtual host 
code will probably be done after 1.2 is out.
