>Description:
Using tabulations in an image map description file disturbs the server.
It returns one of the URLs in the file, but not the expected one.

Image map files working with apache 1.2.* may not work with apache 1.3.3 !!

Is this a bug in the parser ?
>How-To-Repeat:
Use tabulation in an image map description file.

rect	Fails.html	0,0		100,100

instead of
rect Ok.html    0,0 100,100
>Fix:
The current found workaround is :
1) do NOT use tabulations. Use spaces instead ;
2) use only one space between shape type (rect, poly,..) and the URL.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you maybe using a mac or PC to edit the image map files?
tabs work just fine for me... and the code uses isspace()
everywhere which should test for both tab and space.
