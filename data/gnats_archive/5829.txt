Would it be possible to change the error message not in docroot
from suexec to not in suexec docroot?

I only ask because when I was getting this error I didn't realise that the error
message wasn't refering to the <VirtualHost> DocumentRoot.  I feel it would be a
lot more obvious to users that they are two seperate things if they were
specified as such in the error message.
