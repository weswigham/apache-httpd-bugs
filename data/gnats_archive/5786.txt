>Description:
Dear Apache Developers,

I like to mention that Win32 documentation is incomplete.  It is very hard to 
setup and run CGI applications in windows with Apache due to lack of proper documentation, if some one uses .exe aplications and not a scripts. Your windows documentation is only one page wich DOES NOT cover issues with win-cgi at all. 

Most common features and directives to run CGI are not there:
AddType, Action, ScriptInterpreterSource just a few to mention.

PLEASE ADD MORE CGI SETUP INFORMATION FOR WINDOWS USERS.

Thank You.

Oleg

State-Changed-Why:

I added a note on ScriptInterpreterSource to the windows docs.  All the other CGI directives are exactly the same as for other operating systems, so there is no need to duplicate the docs.
