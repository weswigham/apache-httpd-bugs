>Description:
My domain is using the so called "reverse kludge" for reverse DNS. I believe
this is causing 'allow from' directive to accept only some forms of defining
client address. Full configuration can be seen at
http://www.kelloseppakoulu.fi:8888/. That URL maps to the configuration
directory of that server. The configuration is very close to the
example configuration that comes with apache distribution. With that
configuration access is allowed from everywhere, as it should.

The following discussion applies to our domain (which, as mentioned, uses
reverse kludge for reverse DNS). If I replace 'allow from all' with
  allow from 194.100.26.178
which is the address of my computer in that LAN, I am correctly given access.
If I replace it with
  allow from 194.100.26.128/26
or
  allow from kelloseppakoulu.fi
or
  allow from .fi
all of which should grant access to all hosts in our domain, no host in our
domain is given access.

If I try access the server from other domains (which do not use reverse DNS
kludge), following applies. If I replace 'allow from all' with
   allow from 0.0.0.0/0
or
   allow from a.b.c.d/16
and access the server from a.b.x.y, I am not given access although I should, and
if I replace 'allow from all' with
  allow from .hut.fi
and access the server from alpha.hut.fi, I am given access as I should.

a.b.c.d/n is a 1.3 feature, it doesn't work in 1.2.  The
documentation on our website is for 1.3.  It should mention

 In addition to what Dean said about the / notation not being implemented
 in 1.2, the reason why kelloseppakoulu.fi doesn't work is probably because
 your machines aren't configured to return full hostnames.
 
 If you try to access the web server from a machine that should be allowed
 access, what is recorded in the access log for the hostname?  If it is an
 IP, then you either don't have Apache setup to do name lookups or you
 don't have proper reverse.  If it is a hostname without domain, then you
 have an /etc/hosts file or NIS setup that is being used instead of DNS.

 We are using DNS. /etc/hosts has only localhost.
 
 We don't have proper reverse. That's because the resolver we are using, the
 one that is in Linux libc-5.3.12, doesn't handle the reverse kludge
 correctly, and under most circumstanes can't resolve the reverse addresses.
 So that's why 'allow from kelloseppakoulu.fi' doesn't work, obviously.
 
 'allow from 194.100.26.178' works as mentioned, and 'allow from x.y.z.w/n'
 syntax doesn't exist. I'm assuming 'allow from x.y.x.w/255.255.255.0' type
 syntax doesn't exist either - at least it doesn't work for me in our domain
 (always denies access).
 
 Btw, if someone can tell me how to compile the resolver to work with the
 reverse kludge, I'd be grateful.

State-Changed-Why:
The mod_access documentation has been updated to indicate that the
a.b.c.d/x syntaxes only work in 1.3 and later.

As for the resolving problems, you should probably try asking in a
linux specific mailing list or newsgroups.

Thanks for using Apache.
