>Environment:
MS Windows 4.00.1381
IE 4.0 4.72.3110.8 (aka service patch 2)
>Description:
Brand new clean install. I got 1.3.4 off of apache.org and used the setup (typical). No problems reported. However, it didn't work and I noticed a lot of files .conf in the .tmp directory. So I moved those over to .conf. When I ran it from the start menu, no log file created. So I went to DOS prompt. There I got errors on line 93 "serverroot must be a valid directory". The registry entry was there, and as I played with it I could see that the DOS error message was reading from the registry. But it wouldn't move to the next error until I put the actual path in the httpd.conf file. I had the same problem with Document Root "DocumentRoot must be a directory". My guess is that httpd.conf is not reading the registry entry.
>How-To-Repeat:
Clean install of NT version. Verify that installation completes (no files in .tmp) and that serverroot and document root can remain "@@serverroot/?" - if so then its unique to my install.
>Fix:
No.

State-Changed-Why:
You described an installation that failed, but did not
give the error message that you got. We cannot 
look for a problem without this information. In general,
installation does work for most people, but could fail
if you don't have enough disk space or don't have permission
to create directories or files in those directories.

All the problems you mention (files in .tmp, 
configuration files with @@ServerRoot@@ in them, etc)
are because the installation did not succeed. You
should not try to use Apache if installation did not
work.

Each version of Apache for Windows has it's own unique install problems... This one is fixed only to be replaced by another :-)
