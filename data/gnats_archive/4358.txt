Solaris 2.5 with gcc 2.7.x
>Description:
My provider has not configures language support, but I did it by myself via
the .htaccess file without problems - i.e. AddLanguage etc. works fine!
Now I wanted to add "DefaultLanguage en" - after doing so, I received an error
from the server. As it seems DefaultLanguage and AddLanguage should be within
the same "AllowOverride" group I can not figure out that I have done something wrong.

Here is my .htaccess file:

ErrorDocument 500 /error500.html
AddLanguage de .de
AddLanguage en .en
LanguagePriority en de
DirectoryIndex index
Options +MultiViews

because the english index files are named index.html I wanted to
add DefaultLanguage en
The Server is a virtual host.
>How-To-Repeat:
Hopefully the above given information is enough for a reproduction.
Because I have no direct access to the server configs I can not give you
more - sorry.
>Fix:
Maybe DefaultLanguage is not within the same OverrideGroup as AddLanguage,
or it has been documented as usable within .htaccess, but not correctly
implemented?

I cannot reproduce your problem. Using
DefaultLanguage in a .htaccess file works for me if
I set AllowOverride to "FileInfo".

 Dear Lars,
 
 As I wrote, I have no direct access to the apache configuration of my
 provider :( Is it possible, that AddLanguage etc. work without an
 explicit set "AllowOverride FileInfo" - and DefaultLanguage doesn't?
 Btw. do you have tried it with version 1.3.4 or with the latest 1.3.6?
