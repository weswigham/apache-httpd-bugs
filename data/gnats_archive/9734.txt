>Description:
If I overload the public void init(ServletConfig) method in HttpServlet in my implementation of the servlet, that method never gets called and error.log shows NoSuchMethodError encountered when MyServlet::init is attempted by the JServServletManager. If I don't overload init in my class it works properly.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: jerenkrantz
State-Changed-When: Wed Feb 27 08:20:08 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
From our limited knowledge of Java, this is correct behavior.

However, this bug report should be filed against Jakarta's
bug repository:

http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html

(And, I believe mod_jserv is no longer supported.)

This bug report will be closed.

Thanks,
Justin Erenkrantz
