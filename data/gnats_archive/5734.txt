>Description:
I kept getting the undefined reference to crypt message so I searched the FAQ. I
added -lcrypt to EXTRA_LIBS as instructed and tried to rerun the src/Configure
file but get the following message: cd ..;  gcc -DLINUX=2 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE-EXPAT
-I./lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED     -o helpers/dummy helpers/dummy.c  -lcrypt -lm
/user/i386-linux/bin/ld: cannot open -lcrypt: no such file or directory
make: *** [dummy] Error 1
