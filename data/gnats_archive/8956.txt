>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
MS Windows 2000 Professional SP2
AMD Athelon XP, 1 GB ram, 80 gb hd.
Binary Install
>Description:
Using either apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.msi _or_ apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.exe, the installer fails immediately after clicking the "install" button on the dialog (i.e. after all options have been selected etc.). The following error message is displayed:
"Internal Error 2755, 1631, C: DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\_isA7\ApacheHTTP Server 1.3.22.msi". The installer then goes directly to an "interrupted" msg with a "finish" button.

There is 3.89 gb of free space on C:. I'm installing to J: where there's over 6 gb of free space available.

This message is also given right after startup (after "checking an installer version" dialog) if the .exe version is used (but not if the .msi version is used):
"1207: Windows(R) Installer 1.11.2405.0 found. This is an older version of the Windows(R) Installer. Click OK to continue."
>How-To-Repeat:
exec the installer or .exe.
accept license terms
network domain: 216.xx.xxx.xxx (I have no registered domain name)
Server name: 216.xx.xxx.xxx (Wasn't sure what to put here)
[X] Run as a service for all users
[X] Complete - All program features will be installed.
Change install directory to: J:\Apache\ (yes! I did use \ and not /)
click on "install" -->> GET ERROR
>Fix:
Nope - sorry.
