Dir Sir,

I looked for a solution for my problem on apache.org and there I found
your e-mail addresse. I hope that you can help me.

I've just installed a new Debian Linux with an 1.3v Apache server.
And my great problems that I can't use my shell script in my html files
because the SSI doesn't work.
I've already setted the parse parameters and directives (in mime.types,
srm.conf, access.conf) how these were long ago, in earlier Apache
version but all effort was unsuccessful.

I would be very glad if you help me. Thanks in advance.
