No. Another user confirmed this problem. He could get around it by converting

Please try these things and see if your problem is fixed:
1.  put your cgi-bin directory in a dir with no spaces to it
( d:\apache ) and NOT c:\program files\blah.
2. Make sure the #! line is going to the perl interpreter.
3. Some cgi changes went in with 1.3.2 please try and reproduce
wirh 1.3.2 ( I have tested perl cgi's on 1.3.2 and they worked
for me.

 It is. The cgi-bin directory is
 
 In access.conf
 
 <Directory "h:/data/web_data/simcity/cgi-bin">
 
 
 > 2. Make sure the #! line is going to the perl interpreter.
 
 Well, this might be the problem. I have all my scripts set to
 
 #!/usr/local/bin/perl
 
 This is the standard UNIX location, but of course on my local Windows
 system this is not correct. In srm.conf I have the following alias
 
 Alias /usr/local/bin/perl "j:/perl/perl"
 
 I also have perl on the Windows path.

 Fails on 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 the same.

Comment-Added:

The Alias directive is used to map URI locations to
filesystem locations.

  Alias /usr/local/bin/perl "j:/perl/perl"

will not help your CGI problem because the shebang line
starts as a filesystem location and never goes through
the translation.  Why should it?  It's a local file telling
the local server where to find another local file; the
network and the Web aren't involved at all.

As Shane pointed out, try fixing your scripts' shebang lines
to be "#!j:/perl/perl.exe" and see if the situation improves.

 The Alias will not effect the #! line in your perl scripts.
 Try and put the actual path to your perl interpreter and this will work..
 
 ALso note if you are using ActiveSTate perl 4.005 ( I think ) then it 
 installs to a weird and long path....you can NOT move this to something
 like d:/usr/local/bin as then the libraries do not work....
 
 Please try with the correct #! line and provide feedback.

 Well, it changes. But it still dos not work. I get the following error.
 
 "Internal Server Error
 
 Couldn't spawn child process"
 
 
 BUT.....I could get the cgi to work if I made a directory on the same
 drive as Apache called
 
 /usr/local/bin
 
 
 and copied all the perl files into there. The same script that gave the
 'Couldn't spawn child process' now works.
 
 
 This is the best solution anyway - the whole reason for me having an
 Apache server here is to debug perl scripts for my real Apache websites. I
 have to maintain the UNIX paths as on the website.

 If you put
 #!f:/usr/local/bin
   ^^ A drive letter
 Then perl does not have to be on the same drive as Apache...
 but this does not maintain 100% compatiblity with your Un*x box.

 Well, no it did not, unfortunately.
 
 ie #!j:/perl/perl.exe 
 
 does not work. It comes up with a "cannot spawn child process error."
 
 This does not suit anyway as it does not maintain compatibility with my
 UNIX setup. So I made a path on the SAME drive as Apache the same as on
 the UNIX box. ie
 
 /usr/local/bin
 
 I then went to the J:/perl/bin directory and simply copied all the files
 from there to /usr/local/bin and everything worked. And it keeps my UNIX
 system happy.
 
 Good stuff.
 
 While fairly simple in hindsite, perhaps some mention of this might be a
 good idea in the docs for the Windows version.

State-Changed-Why:
If you give the correct path to the perl interpreter
cgi's work and I also just tried having apache on a different
drive that perl adn it worked provided I preface the 
path to the perl interpreter with a drive letter colon ie
#!c:\perl\perl
or
#!perl
as long as perl is in your path
#!/some/dir/with/perl 
as long as this is no the same drive as Apache.
