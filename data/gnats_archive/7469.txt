There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "i586-pc-linux-gnu"...

>How-To-Repeat:
This occured because I did not have my hostname configured properly in
DNS.  
str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0';                            
        if ((!(p = gethostbyname(str)))
            || (!(server_hostname = find_fqdn(a, p)))) {
            /* Recovery - return the default servername by IP: */ 
            if (p->h_addr_list[0]) {                    

You should do another check to make sure p is not null.
