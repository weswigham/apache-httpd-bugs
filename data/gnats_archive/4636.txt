hitting a mod_perl Registry script (or an Apache::ASP script)
resets the PATH to en empty string in the server, which then screws up the
regular CGI scripts.

I'm slowly simplifying the test case, but it appears that any
mod_perl script will do.

Not sure.  Sorry.

 After further investigation it appears that the changes in mod_env are
 probably the culprit.
 
 apache 1.3.6 is working fine with mod_perl, mod_env has changed a bit in
 1.3.7-dev.

Comment-Added:
Could you please come up with a test case where this happens? What do you mean by "CGI accesses"? (which only makes limited sense in a mod_perl context)

Did you try backing mod_env.c back to revision 1.28? (can be done with the patch at <http://www.hyperreal.org/~ask/mod_env_1.29_to_1.28.patch>)
