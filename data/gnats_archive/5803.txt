>Description:
Hi,

when starting Apache on a machine where DocumentRoot 
is a symbolic link it's looking for the .htaccess file 
in /home/ i.e. with an empty username

Error message in error_log is
[Wed Feb 23 23:10:52 2000] [crit] [client 134.171.26.21] (13)Permission denied: /home/.esoacc pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

When I change DocumentRoot to a plain directory the server
starts up fine. BTW: the same behaviour shows up when an
"Alias" directive points to a symbolically linked directory

We're not running NIS on the machine

State-Changed-Why:
That is how it is supposed to work.  You can use
<Directory />
AllowOverride none
</Directory>
to stop the .htaccess checking.
