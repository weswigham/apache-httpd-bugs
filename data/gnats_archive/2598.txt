Linux 2.0.34, GDBM 1.7.3, PERL 5.004, RedHat 5.0
>Description:
Using:

---

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Site admin"
AuthDBMUserFile sitepasswd
AuthDBMGroupFile sitepasswd

<Limit>
order deny,allow
allow from all
require valid-user
</Limit>

---

and loading only mod_auth_dbm, the browser shows "Internal Server Error"
while error log shows :

[crit] configuration error: couldn't check access.  No groups file?: /admin/

Even after deciphering the dbmmanage problem (submitted earlier) didn't
solve this.  Creating a special group file based on the format requested in
the docs didn't resolve this.

The only way I was able to access this area was to modify the config to include
mod_auth, and USR1 the server.

This allowed me to use the same old passwd file, despite it not having group
info in it.
>How-To-Repeat:
You should be able to repeat it by creating a server conf with just mod_auth_dbm
included, and us the above listed .htaccess file.  It should fail as indicated.
>Fix:
A) Document it

    and/or

B) Fix the reason it fails.
