The conf/access.conf file is used to configure access to the server.
Although the online manual suggests that a series of configuration
commands of the form:
   deny from all
   allow from ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca
should be possible, it does not work as described (access is denied to host
ugweb), whereas:
   deny from all
   allow from .cs.ualberta.ca
does allow access to host ugweb, as well as all of its peers in the domain
cs.ualberta.ca.  Preceding the hostname in the first example with "." does
not function as a work-around.  Either the document should be clarified, or
(preferably) the code modified.
>How-To-Repeat:
The above example should suffice
>Fix:
Hack the access code

State-Changed-Why:
User verified that problem was using ugweb instead of 
gwynne; the reverse DNS for that site is what is used.
