>Description:
src/main/http_main.c uses getopt(..."Xd:f:vVhlZ:") and
                          getopt(..."Xd:f:vVhlc:ius").
src/main/http_main.c usage() only describes -d, -f, -v, -h, -l
src/support/httpd.8 only describes -d, -f, -h, -l, -X, -v, -?

Using the "-?" option results in "illegal option -- ?"
>How-To-Repeat:
/usr/local/apache/src/httpd -?
>Fix:
Change src/main/http_main.c and src/support/httpd.8 to describe
all options alphabetically, completely, and consistently.
Make sure "-?" works.

Comment-Added:
The httpd.8 man page should say "this page is not kept up to date
check the html documentation for more info", kind of like the GNU
folks don't keep their man pages up to date.  But I bet the html docs
aren't up to date either.

Except for the Win32/Multithread part in http_main
now the options and manual pages were made consistent
for Apache 1.3b6.
