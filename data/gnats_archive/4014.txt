>Environment:
RedHat 5.2 and Linux Mandrake 5.3
Linux kernels 2.2.1 and 2.2.2
gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
I am running a few flavors of the Linux distribution (Linux Mandrake, RedHat,
TurboLinux) and find that Apache 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 will not allow a browser
(in this case, Netscape Communicator 4.5 for i386 Windows98)to view the content
of the user's (~username) www directory or index.html file (or any other files in 
the directory).

This problem happens on default configured Apache running on RedHat 5.2 or 
LinuxMandrake 5.3 but it doesn't happen on TurboLinux 1.2.  Each system runs
the 2.2.2 Linux kernel however.

>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a RedHat 5.2 Linux box with Apache 1.3.3 or 1.3.4 (it may be in other
versions of 1.3 as well, but I haven't checked them) and then try to access
a user's public_html directory from the web.
>Fix:
Maybe make a configure/compile option for Apache that will address the
different libraries (?) used by RedHat-based Linuses?

I honestly don't have much of a helpful suggestion other than the possibility
that the problem may be specific to RedHat Linux.

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly due to an incorrect Apache
configuration (eg. Directory settings) or to file permissions
(eg. the home directory isn't world readable)

Unfortunately, since you didn't do little things like include
any info from the error log or say there is none, I can't say
much more.

This is almost certainly nothing related to a bug in Apache.

 As I said before, your home directory probably isn't world readable.
 
 Not the directories under it, the directory itself.  All directories in
 the path of the file being accessed, up to and including the directory it
 is in, have to be readable by the user Apache is runnng as, which normally
 means world readable.
