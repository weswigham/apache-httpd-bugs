>Description:
I use IDL a lot (http://www.rsinc.com/), and I periodically put up IDL
programs on the web.  IDL files (*.pro, *.sav) aren't in mime.types, so 
these files get a generic icon.  I made an IDL icon that's about like the
other source code icons, and added the appropriate bits to mime.types.
There aren't any conflicts with other types in this version of the file.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The icon may be had at:
