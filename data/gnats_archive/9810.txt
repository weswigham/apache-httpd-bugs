>Description:
I have checked, rechecked, and again rechecked my conf files, and cannot find an explanation to why i cannot access a directory without an index file.  I get a 403 error.  My configuration for all directories and all vhosts include +Indexes.  I am pretty sure that mod_autoindex was also included in the compilation of apache.  Other than that, decent build.  Where can I comment on the beta releases?

No

 I have discovered the cause to this problem
 [configuration error].  I accidentally ran across the
 solution while installing APACHE/WIN.  This thread
 should be closed, as this is not a bug.
