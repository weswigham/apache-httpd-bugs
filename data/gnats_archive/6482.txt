>Description:
I'm not sure if this is the problem with Apache but I'll explain the scenario here. I couldn't find anything related to this problem in bug database.

I have a servlet application through which I can upload files to the server. I'm able to send any amount of data through this application but the problem comes into picture only when I try to send files (more than 40KB) of type application/msword (word document). Where as I don't face any problem in sending about 4MB of txt file. 

I tried the same set of servlets with 'servletrunner' but I don't get any errors. I'm able to send any size of word document through 'servletrunner'. I get errors only with Apache-Jserv. 

Help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Vadivelu
