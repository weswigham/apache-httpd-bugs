>Release:        1.2.4
>Environment:
SunOS reason 5.5.1 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
Solaris 2.5.1 OS
SunWorks SUNWspro C compiler version 4.2
>Description:
Using Sun's 4.2 CC compiler, Configure generates
an optimization flag of -o2.  This generates an 
warning message during compiling like:
WARNING:  option -2 passed to ld

The Sun compiler wants -xO2 or -xO (both are
equivalent)
>How-To-Repeat:
run Configure and make using Sun's cc compiler
>Fix:

The fix is to change the OPTIM variable in the
Makefile to 
OPTIM=-xO2
for the case of using Sun's cc
The Sun C preprocessor defines __SUNPRO_C=0x420
for detecting these compilers.

State-Changed-Why:
This is cleaned up in 1.3... but requires a little too much surgery
to do in 1.2.  As you mention, you can work around the problem by
setting OPTIM in Configuration.  So I'm going to close this out, thanks
for the note.
