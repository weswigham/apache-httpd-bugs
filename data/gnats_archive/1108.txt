Solaris, Linux
>Description:
When using a ProxyPass to mirror another server, if %2F ('/') appears in a
directory name it causes a 404 on the proxy server.

There's a similar bug in mod_rewrite for redirects - see #1103
>How-To-Repeat:
ProxyPass /foo http://www.wired.com/news/

http://localhost/foo - this works
http://localhost/foo?%2F - this works
http://localhost/foo/%2F - causes 404 on the local server.  In this case it
  should return the remote server's 404 page.
>Fix:
Provide an alternative to escape_url() that does the right thing?
