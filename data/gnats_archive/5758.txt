>Description:
A URI with a query string of [abc] is urlencoded as 
  uri?%5Babc%5D

The QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED variable is set to \[abc\]
I cannot find any documentation about QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED
and would have expected QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED to be set to [abc].
Not all urlencoded characters will be preceeded by a \.  "=+" are 
unescaped without the \ (ie 3D%2B becomes "=+") but urlencoded {} (%7B%7D)
is held in QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED as \{\}.    
 
>How-To-Repeat:
Use http://www.hcidata.co.uk/testenvi.htm

This will submit a form (method=GET) with many non-alphanumeric characters.
The next html page uses SSIs to echo various environmental variables such as
QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED
