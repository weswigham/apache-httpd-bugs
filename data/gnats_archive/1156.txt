>Description:
I've read and reread the documentation for AllowOverrides and mod_autoindex,
and played with all the options (as far as I can tell), and I've come to the
conclusion that there is no way to allow users (via .htaccess) to enable or 
disable Indexing without 'AllowOverides options' which would also allow users
to turn things like ExecCGI on, which I certainly don't want.

I'd like to default to having indexes off, but still allow indexes to be turned
on for individual directories (or trees) via .htaccess, WITHOUT also 
giving ExecCGI too.

It would be nice if there was an IndexOption that turned indexes on and off,
or if 'Options +indexes' worked without 'AllowOverrides Options' 
with 'AllowOverrides indexes'.

If this can be done then the documentation doesn't mention it or I missed it
after repeated readings.
>How-To-Repeat:
<Directory />
AllowOverides indexes
Options -indexes
</Directory>

and in the .htaccess file: (any of)

options +indexes
IndexOptions FancyIndexing
>Fix:
# wishful thinking--something like this in .htaccess
IndexOptions indexing=on
IndexOptions noinde
