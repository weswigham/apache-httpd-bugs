>Release:        
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
WinNT4.0
>Description:
I switched the parameters usage (key/element of hashtable) in getInstance.
Then cocoon was doing fine as standalone.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to run cocoon 173 as standalone
>Fix:
modify engine.java: (dwe!!)
    public static Engine getInstance(Configurations confs, Object context) throws Exception {

        Engine engine = null;
        if(confs != null)
//	dwe!!		engine = (Engine) engineInstances.get(context);
			engine = (Engine) engineInstances.get(confs);
        
        if (engine == null) {
           synchronized (Engine.class) {
              engine = new Engine(confs, context);
//	dwe!!              engineInstances.put(context, engine);
              engineInstances.put(confs, engine);
           }
        }

        return engine;
