>Description:
If the DirectoryIndex file does not exist in a directory Apache shows a file
created on-the-fly.  The right column is labelled "Description" but there is 
no documentation on how to activate it so users can see a description of the
files.  Index.txt or Files.BBS are commonly used by FTP sites and BBS's but
nothing I have tried works.  Documenting this feature would help!

If a default file for descriptions exist...document it :-)

This is documented in the mod_autoindex (well, mod_dir in
1.2.x) docs under the AddDescription directive.

 That documentation is so unclear as to be unusable.  My guess is that
 the lines indicated would be added to the srm.conf file.  With 40,000+
 files online here it would be a bit cumbersome to do so manually.  Use
 of a standard format FILES.BBS or INDEX.TXT file would be much more
 realistic and would greatly simplify maintenance.  Tools exist for
 generating them automatically.
