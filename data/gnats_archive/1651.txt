>Description:
I'm attempting to set-up authentication. Realizing that crypt()-like
functionality isn't available on NT (yet), my pw file looks like the following:

dave:tiger

When requesting anything in the "protected" area, I'm prompted
(correctly) for user name/pw. I enter dave for name and tiger for
pw. It fails.  The error_log tells me that:

[Sun Jan 11 16:35:51 1998] [error] user dave: password mismatch: /cgi-shl/junk.cgi

Now for the interesting part -- if I modify my pw file so it looks like:

dave: 

(that is it has no pw) everything works just fine. So I think there may be
some problem with the way pw's on interpreted (or user names w/pw's...)

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure you had a blank line at the end of your
passwd file?  It isn't necessary, but you do need to terminate
the first line and that is the easiest way to make sure it happens...

If you enter an empty password, the behaviour isn't defined.

Yes, you're right about that. However, this is not the essence of the
problem. 

The right conclusion here is that the password matching *only* works for
passwords consisting of an empty string. In all other cases, the
matching fails with a "password mismatch" error as a result. In short,
password matching does not work even though the passwords are stored in
plain text.

Cheers,
Magnus
