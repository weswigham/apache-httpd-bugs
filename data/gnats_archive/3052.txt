>Description:
Where mod_speling.c gave a list of possible choices of similar filenames with
common a common basename in apache-1.3.1, now in apache-1.3.2 the mod_speling.c
is only outputing "Multiple Choices Spelling fix: /~msolomon/laughBG: 2 candidates "
ONLY without a list of choices.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at 'http://www.seva.net/~msolomon/laughBG' -- there are two files there
named "laughBG.gif" and "laughBG.jpg" and note the lack of a pick list from
apache.

 Hmmm. Make sure that you applied the patch, cleaned and remade,
 reinstalled everything, and fully stopped and started the server.
 Please also make sure that there are no caches in the way; try
 connecting directly rather than through any proxies and clean out any
 browser caches.
 
 I was able to duplicate this bug before applying this patch, but
 everything seemed to work after the patch on my servers.
 
 If none of the above helps, are there any 3rd party modules installed
 or other patches applied?
