OpenStep 4.2, Mach
>Description:
For as far as I can remember back, NEXTSTEP and now OpenStep has displayed this bug.  I have reported it in the past.

NeXT's strftime does not support the %T shorthand for HH:MM:SS, as a result its necessary to declare it long form.


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:

This can be corrected simply be adjusting line 94 of mod_include.c to use

#define DEFAULT_TIME_FORMAT "%A, %d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S %Z"
