redhat
>Description:
i just upgraded from redhat 5.1 to 5.2.  prior to this we could o directory
browsing via http.  but now we get a forbidden access if there is no index.html.
this only occors on user accounts.  that is, the browsing will work on
directories in /home/httpd/html/ but not in ~/public_html/.

State-Changed-Why:

asked in a user support forum, not a bug reporting forum.

You need to ensure that the Options directive covering
the directories in question includes "Indexes".
