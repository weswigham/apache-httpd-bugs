>Release:        1.3.9
>Environment:
Windows 95 OSR2
>Description:
When setting a command line paramter containing a space, such as

apache -d /work/apache -c "ProxyRequests On"

The function create_process when starting a child process loses the quotes so 
that ProxyRequests and On become separate paramaters, leading to a failure to 
start the child. The parent loops indefinitely restarting the child.


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Changing line 5819 of http_main.c (in create_process) to quote all parameters
fixes the problem for me on windows 95. I will post a patch to new-httpd later.
