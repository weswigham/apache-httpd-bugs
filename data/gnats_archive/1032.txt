>Environment:
Linux Slackware v3.2 with Kernel 2.0.30
Apache 1.2.3 compiled with gcc,  using suEXEC. No VirtualHosts setup yet. Root server only.  Running Apache under "user/group" www.frontpage from /var/lib/httpd.
All file permissions set to user/group www.frontpage and chmod 755.
MS Front Page Extensions installed and working fine.
>Description:
No core dumps.

I used to have Apache 1.2.1 setup on a Linux box as a proxy server. Using Microsoft Explorer on a W95 box I always accessed the http://investor.msn.com  without any problem. Upgraded to Apache 1.2.3 and cannot use Apache as a proxy server any more for THIS PARTICULAR SITE ONLY. I did not check many others, but a few worked ok. 
Aparently the problem is with the home.asp file that gets loaded from this URL. Don't know enough to understand what's going on.
>How-To-Repeat:
Probably yes. Try going to http://investor.msn.com through an Apache 1.2.3 proxy server.
>Fix:
Re-install Apache 1.2.1 (simply replaced the binary-executable%2
