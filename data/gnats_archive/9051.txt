I see a lot of people asking about solutions as to why their ColdFusion module doesn't work with Apache. To save Apache.org time from having to answer these non-Apache-related queries, here are URL links that should answer nearly all their questions: 
http://www.allaire.com/developer/documentation/coldfusion.cfm and download "Installing and Configuring Coldfusion Server"--it'll give them all the configuration instructions for Apache.
