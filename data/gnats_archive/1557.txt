FreeBSD 3.0-970815-SNAP #0	
>Description:
I've wrote a module doing user configurable directory file listing.
the first thing is reading in the format template, in the merge step.
the problem is, the first server's template pointer, seemed to be appended
part of the configuration files such as httpd.conf, srm.conf. thus, 
the stuff sent out will be with part of the configuration files.
and the second or above server won't, neither would apache 1.2
but I didn't see this problem happening in other modules. hope it's not my
bug.

but it's hard to get to the first server, so you may want to see the source code

>Fix:
well, still debugging & tracing

State-Changed-Why:
I doubt this is a problem with Apache, it's more likely a problem
with how your module is implemented.  The URL you gave does not
resolve so I can't look at it.  In general though we can't help
folks write modules... but if you can get a working URL someone
may find time to look at it.
