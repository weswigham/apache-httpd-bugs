>Environment:
I'm running a virtual host with Hiway Technologies (http//www.hway.net)  Don't know the specs.
>Description:
This problem probably exists due to my ignorance, but Hiway's tech support is stumped and gave up on me.  If I place a modified .htaccess file in my root directory making all of my .html file parsed for SSIs, the SSL stops working as well as the date and time stamps included with the include are incorrect.

Can you please advise as to the correct format for the .htaccess file and config for hiway?  They said they have contacted you also.

Please advise ASAP, I'd really like to get this working.

Regards,

Brad

State-Changed-Why:
This is a very site-specific question.  SSL is not included
in the base Apache distribution, so we can't support it 
since it could be any one of several versions.  

Sorry.  Hope you have fixed your problem.
