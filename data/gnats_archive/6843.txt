i have no core dumped!
i think a system network call made by httpd process is the source of the problem or
maybe my linux box is managing too much tcp connections!
>How-To-Repeat:
i don't know
>Fix:
i think the source of the problem is the kernel TCP/IP stack, but 
i don't know how to fix it. Could you give me some advise? Thanks.
