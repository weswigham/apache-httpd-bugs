>Description:
I am working in a very simple reverse proxy configuration, which I have only one server and several clients for traffic load. The clients connect to reverse proxy which direct the requests to the server (no caching).After heavy traffic Apache clients stop handing requests. it seams that they are stuck on blocking because the CPU idle is almost 100%. This situation can be easily reproduce by reducing the MaxClients to 1 and then producing heavy traffic. After few minutes the Apache stops handling requests but the interesting think is that the PC is not working at all CPU idle 100%. The only way to make the Apache start working again is to restart him.
