A Windows ME. 4.90.3000 I've downloaded the compiled version
>Description:
When I try to execute a CGI file(which is placed in the cgi-bin) It gives a 500 Internal Server Error. 
When I look in the Error log it gives:
[Wed Apr 04 19:51:01 2001] [info] Parent: Created child process -169179
[Wed Apr 04 19:51:01 2001] [info] Parent: Duplicating socket 76 and sending it to child process -169179
[Wed Apr 04 19:51:01 2001] [info] BytesRead = 372 WSAProtocolInfo = 020
[Wed Apr 04 19:53:12 2001] [error] [client 62.45.8.28] couldn't spawn child process: c:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/survey.cgi

Please help me, cause i havb't found a way to fix this problem myself and neither in a FAQ.

Thanxs in advance
Paul
