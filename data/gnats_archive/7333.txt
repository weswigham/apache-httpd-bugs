>Description:
Hello,

I have a technical question and I couldn't find it on
any FAQ or tech help site.  If you can, could you tell
me where I should send a tech question?

This is my problem...

I'm running apache 1.3.12 (I tried to upgrad to 1.3.17
but it didnt work) on SuSe Linux 5.4 kernal 2.2.12
I got the httpd up and running but I cannot run any
cgi file i upload.  I can run the CGI files that were
compiled when apache was compiled but not my own.

This is the httpd error I get in the error_log

[Tue Feb 27 20:41:57 2001] [error] (2)No such file or
directory: exec of
/usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/cgitest.cgi failed
[Tue Feb 27 20:41:57 2001] [error] [client
24.4.225.187] Premature end of script headers:
/usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/cgitest.cgi

Perl is running and the httpd.conf file is configured
to look for cgiscripts in /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/

Can you help me out please?

Thanks

Shawn

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
