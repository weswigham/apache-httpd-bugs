>Description:
As described in bug #6017 (among others), RLimitNPROC does not have any effect when used in conjunction with suEXEC. With the gain in popularity of simple to use and socket-friendly tools such as PHP, anyone can DoS even a medium-sized server without hurting his fingers, by using copy-pasted code such as :

#!/usr/bin/php -q
<?php
$i = 0;
while ($i < 1000) {
    $fp = fsockopen ("www.unluckydotcom.com", 80, $errno, $errstr, 10);
    if (!$fp) {
        echo "$errstr ($errno)\n";
    } else {
        fputs ($fp,"GET /fat.cgi HTTP/1.1\r\n");
        fputs ($fp,"Host: www.unluckydotcom.com\r\n\r\n");
        fclose ($fp);
    }
    $i++;
}
?>

And I can assure you that b0red teenagers on IRC saturdays night don't pass the opportunity.

On a shared hosting environment, you cannot enforce safe script programming for each of your hundreds of customers, and you are bound to get one or two frozen servers each month, specially if you host high-profile sites...

I rated this problem as SERIOUS, because any 6-years-old kid with a modem can DoS your server with a simple BROWSER. huh.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. configure a vhost or server with RLimitNPROC 4 4 - for exemple
2. start a "top d 1" session on this server
3. load a fat and long running cgi script on this vhost and hit "reload" 20 times very quickly.
4. watch in despair as the 20 first lines of your "top" are filled with the cgi script's name...
>Fix:
As _not_ using suEXEC is not appealing (RLimitNPROC becomes global), the only solution we found was to install mod_throttle_access to limit the number of concurrent accesses to a given Location. It works "tant bien que mal".
