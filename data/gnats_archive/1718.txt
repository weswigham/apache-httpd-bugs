>Environment:
SunOS m012006 5.6 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5 patched with
sun recommended cluster from 12/17/97.
>Description:
see this message in error_log, but fairly infrequently: 2-3 in 24hr period.
the site is not heavy. recently (last few days) moved from SunOS 4.1.4
apache 1.1.1 w/ frontpage 1.1.1 on a Sparc2 to this site Sparc5 Solaris 2.6
w/ frontpage 3.0.
i did add to /etc/rc2.d/S69inet at the bottom
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_slow_start_initial 2

should i be concerned?
>How-To-Repeat:
i doubt that it is easily repeatable since it is very infrequent and 
nothing in either logs points the way.
>Fix:
nope

State-Changed-When: Sat Feb  7 03:55:03 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
I doubt it's anything to worry about.  It's likely just caused
by sockets which are accept()d and then the client closes the
connection before it's actually used... there's a small window in
which this can happen, so it won't occur frequently.  If you
suspect something worse down the road feel free to open another
report.

Thanks for using Apache!
