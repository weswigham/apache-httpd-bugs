>Description:
When I print out all of my ENV variables in a perl script, the HTTP_REFERER does not show up
I have made this declration:
$my_url = "$ENV{'HTTP_REFERER'}";
REF: $my_url;

But the HTTP_REFERER still has yet to show.  I have linked to this script, but it will not
show the referer. I am using Netscape 4.06, so I know the browser is passing the info.
I really need help with this!!  I have programs that depend on this to work.
I DO have mod_env installed!!
<!--#echo VAR="HTTP_REFERER"--> -- This SSI code won't even work on the server!
I'm at a loss!
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.webnautics.com/cgi-bin/refer.pl -- ENV print out....link to it and you
will see the REF: is blank!
http://cafe.webnautics.com/  --  this is where the SSI code is not working. 
It is part of a counter I use to track Referers. View Source, and scroll ALL the
way to the bottom to see.
>Fix:
Please Call me 1-800-810-7270 OR 1-912-423-9390
and let me know what is going on.  I have posted to the UseNet and 
NO ONE has ever had this problem

Thank You,
Brant

 Sorry, it isn't blank:
 
 HTTP_REFERER : file://localhost/tmp/foo.html
 
 Double check what you are doing, and be sure you are linking to it from a
 page got via HTTP and not from a local file, since some clients won't send
 referers from local files.

 	The "Bug" turned out to be, as usual, Human Error.  Sorry to alarm
 everyone!
 
 Thank You,
