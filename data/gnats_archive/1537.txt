Subject: A Personal Message.....

We placed an ad in one small area of the Internet. And when

the dust started to settle we had over six thousand responses

in ten days.

COLORADO MARKETING FIRM SHARES MONEY

GENERATING TRADE SECRETS ON THE INTERNET!

-----------------------------------

Hello,

My Name is Shannon Johnson. I am CEO of Success Concepts in

Fort Collins Colorado. I have to tell you that I am really angry and upset

about what is going on here on the Internet. We at Success Concepts

are so angry, in fact, that we decided to do something about it. Read on

and you'll see.

For three years I have lead my marketing firm in sales campaigns on

the Internet and the other large online services which have yielded

outstanding results! We are now sharing the information we have

gained over the last several years with other people who are desperately

trying to figure out how to make a substantial income from their home

computers.

Do you know what it's like to turn your computer on in the morning to

find an email box full of orders for your product.....Where it takes over

an hour to sift through just the credit card orders alone?

We do!

Do you know what it's like to have the postman bring you a bag full of

orders for products you have marketed on the Internet, and then hear

him complain about all the mail you get?

We do!

Do you know what it's like to place a simple ad into a newsgoup or

classified section on the Internet and have your Order Department's

phone ring off the hook with people who want to buy your product.

We do!

Have you ever placed just one advertisement on the Ineternet and when

the dust settled ten days later had over 6,000 responses by phone,

fax, mail, and email?

Well....we did in January of this year!

Have you ever tried to market something simple on the Internet, only

to have weeks or months of toil and effort result in only a few sales,

if any?

Well....that's happened to us too. But not since we learned the secrets!!!

You see, we found the "secrets" to marketing just about anything on

the Internet. And it is really quite simple, once you know them.

Imagine this. You decide to make a second, or even a primary

income from the Internet. So, you put up a Web Site, get a mess

of email follow-up letters ready, put your Web Site in several hundred

search engines (people gotta find your page...right), get in the News-

Groups and advertise your site, and drop hundreds of classified ads

all over the Net. There ya go.....now you are going to rake in the cash!

Two weeks later you have one sale and you are telling your spouse

and your friends that "This will take time! " Four months later you've

made just enough to pay for your web space and your friends don't

listen to you anymore. They consider you an "Internet Marketer

Wanna Be". Sound familiar!

We are not trying to rub salt in your wounds. What we are trying to

do is let you in on the TRUTH about doing business from your home

on the Internet. Let's face it. The vast majority of people who are

trying to earn a living on the Internet are STARVING!!! That's right!

They don't have a clue of what to do first, second, third or fourth! And

even if they do have a clue they have been lead down the garden path

with dreams and silly techniques which don't work and are breaking

the hearts of thousands of people who are just trying to make a living

from their home computers. That is what we are so upset about at

Success Concepts!

But, it doesn't have to be that way! People don't have to really FAIL at

making a good income on the Internet. And it really doesn't have to

take months or even years to learn how to do it. Not if you have the

right guide to show you what to do, and when to do it.

THE GUIDE (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is the name of our informative guide to generating orders, money, cash,

on the Net. It was written with the "average" Netrepreneur in mind, in

plain English, with straight to the point "How To" and "Why Do You Do"

phraseology.

In......

THE GUIDE (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

we expose all the traps WE fell into in our first year of Internet Marketing,

but stay away from now. We expose the lies and half truths which people

have fallen for in the past. We expose the SECRETS which most of the

successful Internet Marketers really DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW!

Because, when you know the secrets you will be off and running in...

that's right......THEIR BACKYARD....the Cyberspace Marketplace!

THERE IS ROOM FOR A LOT MORE OF US!

There are millions of people on the Internet. And there are millions

of more people on the way here. The pie which will be cut up is

so huge that several hundred more people who know what they are

doing will not even make a dent in our income level. It will just be a

drop in the bucket so to speak.

THE GUIDE (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

will expose the Ineternet for what it really is, the marketplace which

can provide you with a steady income. It will literally show you what

to do first, second, third, fourth, and so on.

You are about to discover exactly what makes the difference between

the "Internet success stories," and the obscure "Web Marketing Failures."

This guide will give you all the details, the tools, the ideas, and the

resources to help you make all of your INTERNET DREAMS come true...

Finally, the truth is revealed! Find out the secrets that some of the

wealthiest Internet marketers are using to propel their sales through the

Cyberspace roof.

THE GUIDE (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

Will show you:

** How to use Newsgroups to your advantage. The tricks!

Just placing a few ads just won't do it for you!

** How to use a sig file to get more orders. They look simple, but if

you write your Sig correctly it can be a GOLD MINE to you. We generate

thousands just from our sigs!

** How to place your web page at the top of the search engines.

If you don't get close to the top you can forget many hits!

** How to maximize your web sales using a professional looking web page

(that you can build all by yourself).

** All about follow-ups and how to do them using email.

A very simple technique which can mean rapidly increasing volume to

you. This technique is used by some of the top Internet Marketers.

** How to effectively build mailing lists on the internet.

Without lists your business will probably perish!

** Special Coding Techniques which can make your Marketing efforts

amaze even the most die hard skeptics

** Where and how to place thousands of FREE classified ads.

What to say in them, and what to expect when you place them.

** What products you should or shouldn't market for quick results

** How to use Testimonials...

** The importance of tracking your marketing results.

** The importance of a "back-end".

** A step by step guide to get you started IMMEDIATELY!

** And much, much more...

Here is what some people who turned their Internet Marketing

results from failure to success have to say about "The Guide":

I thought all I had to do was place some classified ads on the Net for

my flame retarding spray. Every night after work I would place a

few ads and answer some questions in email. I never made much

money at all. Then I read THE GUIDE and everything turned around!

I'm looking at leaving my job now. And their newsletter keeps me up

to date with all the new things I need to know to keep on track with

my business.

I started Internet Marketing in the Chat Rooms on AOL. What

a joke that was! Nobody ever told me it would take so long to

make any money that way. Then I read the 'The Guide." The

Chat Rooms, Internet Newsgroups, Web Sites, and email all

make me money now. And it wasn't all that hard either. I just

didn't know the secrets before. But I do now!!! The Internet is

huge, and I've just started getting my share!

THE GUIDE (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is usually only offered to our marketing clients. With all the garbage

we have seen on the Internet in the past few months we have decided

to offer "The Guide" to everyone reading this advertisement. Our clients

have paid $99.95 for "The Guide" and have felt that it was a real bargain

for that price. "The Guide" has now gone into it SECOND Edition and

we feel that we should open it up to just about anyone's financial budget.

At least for a limited time.

THE GUIDE (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is being offered to you, for a limited time, for only $24.95!!! That's

correct! That's a full $75 off the regular price. Once 200 more or

so orders have been placed at this price we will take "The Guide"

off of the sale counter and move the price back to $99.95. But, why

offer this for such a deep discount? It's simple. Success Concepts

feels that the time is right for this information to become more available

on the Net. But we aren't marketing fools either. The Guide holds a

Copyright, and will only be offered at this very deeply discounted price

for a very limited time.

(There is some Joker on the Net who is trying to sell LESS information

without our two bonus offers to follow for $395.00. That is ridiculous!!!)
