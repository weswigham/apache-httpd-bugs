Oracle 8.0.5.1.0, JDBC OCI8
>Description:
Hi, Apache Support Team:

I created the environment to use servlet to access Oracle 8.0.5.1.0 by using
Apache Jserv 1.1.1. The thin jdbc driver runs fine, but I want to use oci8
(thick) driver, because I should deal with BLOB and BFILEs.

I configured jserv.properties and set java run time path
"-Djava.library.path=/usr/oracle/lib" which is my jdbc native library's path.

Now, jserver is started. I use following java servlet to connect to oracle rdbms
and the error occurs, and stack trace is as following:

-------------------------------------
import java.io.*;

import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import java.sql.*;


/**
 * This is a simple example of an HTTP Servlet.  It responds to the GET
 * and HEAD methods of the HTTP protocol.
 */
public class Dictionary1 extends HttpServlet
{ 
    /**
     * Handle the GET and HEAD methods by building a simple web page.
     * HEAD is just like GET, except that the server returns only the
     * headers (including content length) not the body we write.
     */
	static private String errString;
	static Connection conn;
	public void init (ServletConfig config)
	throws ServletException
	{
		super.init(config);
		errString=null;
	}	
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response) 
        throws ServletException, IOException
        {
            PrintWriter out;
            String title = "Example Apache JServ Servlet";

            // set content type and other response header fields first
            response.setContentType("text/html");

            // then write the data of the response
            out = response.getWriter();
            
            out.println("<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>");
            out.println(title);
            out.println("</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">");
            out.println("<H1>" + title + "</H1>");
            out.println("<H2> Congratulations, ApacheJServ 1.1 is working!</H2><br>");
			try {
				DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());
				conn= DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:oci8:@o8051","scott","tiger");
				Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
				out.println("<table>");
				ResultSet rset = stmt.executeQuery("select TABLE_NAME, COMMENTS from DICTIONARY");
				while (rset.next())
						out.println("<tr><td>"+rset.getString(1)+"<td>"+rset.getString(2));
				out.println("</table>");
				rset.close();
				stmt.close();
        		conn.close();

            out.close();

---------------------------
Using the absolutely same environment, this servlet works fine on Netscape Enterprise 4.0's servlet engine
 

>How-To-Repeat:
Could you please use above java servlet source code to test, please change the
connection string (here is o8051) for your testing environment.
>Fix:
When I failed, I checked "netstat -na" to see if this servlet tried to connect
to Oracle DB server, but no any active connection made. I wonder if Apache Jserv
engine forbidded the running servlet to open socket, or Jserv does not support
java native interface very well.

Your help will be highly appreciated.
