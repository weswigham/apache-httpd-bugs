Linux 2.0.14
>Description:
When an FTP connection is attempted using the proxy module, the error
"proxy:error setting PASV debug option" appears in the log and the connection
fails.
>How-To-Repeat:
FTP to any site.
>Fix:
It seems that the Linux kernel requires ROOT permission to set the DEBUG
option on a socket.  It also seems that the DEBUG option is not actually
required on the FTP socket.  The code that sets the DEBUG option can be
removed without apparent effect to the remaining code.  My patch is to
insert #ifndef LINUX/#endif around the code in modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c
thusly:

#ifndef LINUX
    if (setsockopt(dsock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_DEBUG, (const char *)&one,
      sizeof (int)) == -1)
    {
        proxy_log_uerror("setsockopt", NULL,
            "proxy: error setting PASV debug option", r->server);
        pclosef(pool, dsock);
        pclosef(pool, sock);
        return SERVER_ERROR;
    }
#endif%0
