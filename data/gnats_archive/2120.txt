>Release:        1.3b6
>Environment:
Win95, downloaded the binary of 1.3b6
>Description:
Installed binary release under windows 95,
Uncommented the loadmodule proxy command in the httpd.conf
Tried to run, fails with "cannot load module_proxy dll" error.
If I re-comment the loadmodule line, apache loads great and works fine.
It appears the dll is either corrupt or apache is just not able to load it for some
reason (size?)
>How-To-Repeat:
Apache will not run, bombs with failed to load module_proxy 
>Fix:
Nope!  If I do not uncomment the loadmodule command, apache works great!

State-Changed-Why:
As I said on Usenet, this is a known bug that only pops
up in Win95 and that we don't have a solution for yet.
It works fine under NT, and there is a report of it working
under 98.  There is already PR#1462 open on this, so the
issue will be tracked under that.
