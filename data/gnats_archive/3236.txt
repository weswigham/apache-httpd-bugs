>Environment:
Win9x/NT. The executable I downloaded was apache_1_3_3.exe and I
have changed nothing in this file.
>Description:
Because of not being able to limit the size of error_log I don't want to let
error_log create. So I uncomment it in file highperformance.conf-dist.
It looks now:
# it's always nice to know the server has started
#ErrorLog logs/error_log
But error_log is created evertime I start the Apache server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start and kill the Server twice and open some files in browser which
aren't existing.
>Fix:
None, it's a bug I think.

State-Changed-When: Sun Oct 18 22:48:32 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
If you read the docs for the ErrorLog directive, you
will see that the default is "logs/error_log" so
commenting it out won't disable that.

If you wish to disable it being logged to disk,
"ErrorLog nul" should do it.

 Erm... no it doesn't, but it does say what the default is, ie.
 "logs/error_log".  Default means that if you don't have it set to anything
 else.

 First of all, "*-dist" files are the distributed config files.  Second,
 you need to read the comment at the top of the file to figure out why it
 doesn't use highperformance.conf.  You need to set it in httpd.conf unless
 you change the config file being used.

 Thanks for your fast reply, this was my fault. As I write "ErrorLog nul"
 in httpd.conf it has the right effect. Thanx. I can only repeat I'm a
 Windowser. But can you tell me how I could limit the error_log file size?
