State-Changed-Why:
Sure enough, the docs were wrong, IdentityCheck is only
allowed to be set in the .conf files.  Sorry about that,
a fix has been applied to the documentation.

>>Status: core

I can use the directive only inside a <Directory >...</Directory> section 
of access.conf. Here is what I get if I try using the directive inside the
following .htaccess file:

public_html/ident/.htaccess:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
AddType application/x-httpd-cgi CGI
IdentityCheck On
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

error.log:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Thu Feb  5 13:03:10 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: 
 [...] public_html/ident/.htaccess: IdentityCheck not allowed here
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, it seems the directory got enough privileges to add the cgi type, but
not to enable an ident... At the very least, I feel this as a shortcoming
in the docs, which states to the opposite of what happens, or refrains from
stating which options you need to be able to enable IdentityCheck on a 
granular, per-directory way.

Yours,
