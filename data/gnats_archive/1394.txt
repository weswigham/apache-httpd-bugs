Windows 95
>Description:
I installed the Win32-Version (1.3b2) of Apache out of a self-extracting EXE-File.
I edited *.conf-Files exactly like the *.conf-Files on my Linux-Apache. If I request a URL
without naming the correct filename (e.g. http://192.168.1.2/) I receive the Error "not found" from the Server.
A request with http://192.168.1.2/index.html the correct page will be shown.
I set the DirectoryIndex-Parameter as
DirectoryIndex index.html
The second mystery ist, that I can't get a directory-listing.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try any URL without naming the filename (Windows 95)
>Fix:
Maybe the Apache-Server has a problem with the long filenames in Win95 when guessing the name by its own..
