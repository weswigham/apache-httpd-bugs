 The ampersand, as explained by the man page, means that the offset is relative:
 
     Sometimes you do not know the exact offset as this depends on the length of
     preceding fields. You can specify an offset relative to the end of the last
     uplevel field (of course this may only be done for sublevel tests, i.e. test 
     beginning with > ).  Such a relative offset is specified using & as a prefix 
     to the offset.
 
 mod_mime_magic complains about these entries, first that the offset is invalid, then that the type is invalid.  The code should probably be updated to either
 understand this, or ignore the line a little more quietly.
