>Description:
I have started a business called ViperSoft Inc. and wish to have a website. I have registered and payed for www.vipersoft.org, and wish to host it on my own with Apache. That is all, and I have followed the manual and FAQs, but I still can't seem to get it to work! Can someone please guide me through the process of just getting the site UP?
