 Quote from customer Feb 2001
 “ I was suffering from “Panic Attacks” and in my country you cannot order
 from a Doctor unless your oxygen count is low.
 
 What they fail to understand, when one has an attack, it is mentally not
 physically. This requires one to inhale oxygen so you can get a second
 breath.
 
 This country has a lot to learn when it comes to holistic approaches!”
