>Description:
I have installed Apache on an OS/2 machine with expected (good) results.
Installation on a Unix workstation evidently requires compiling the Apache
source. This has introduced a can (should I say, barrel) of worms--it is
nothing less than an abomination to read through the install instructions 
for a C compiler, say GNU gcc, let alone getting it to work. Is there no 
concept of a "quick-start" for the makers of this C compiler? After all, 
I want to administer a web server and do functional, practical things with Apache, 
not learn C. Can there be an Apache installation on Unix which, like the 
OS/2 version, is pre-compiled and does not involve the user with C?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
A pre-compiled Unix version of Apache. The OS/2 version does not involve
using a C compiler and I am very happy about its easy installation and its
subsequent performance.

State-Changed-Why:
Do you have any idea how many different Unix platforms there
are?  Binaries are provided for some, but keeping them up to
date for hundreds of platforms isn't practical.

It really isn't that tough to compile Apache once you have
a compiler, and if installing a compiler on your OS is
difficult then that is really a problem with your OS.

 Take a look at
 http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries/solaris/
 There seems to be a 1.3.1 ver, but not the latest
 1.3.3  The process to build the binary images
 seem to be in discussion, but this would be the place
 to look to find it.
