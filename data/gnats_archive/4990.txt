RedHat 6.0 apache 1.3.6 using as a proxy server 2 nics one is on the 10.0.0.0 network and the other is on the real network 209.109.185.0Linux proxy.fisonline.com 2.2.5-15 #1 Mon Apr 19 22:21:09 EDT 1999 i586 unknown
>Description:
When accessing the web site www.spectera.com from behind the proxy server I can view the main web page, however; when I click on the Providor Locator image it returns an error of you don't have access to view this page.


What I believe is happening is the apache proxy server isn't allowing ssl on port 9001 to return to the proxy server but I am not sure
>How-To-Repeat:
i am using internet explorer 5.0 behind the proxy server I have configuration of my proxy set up correctly as far as I know I can get to just about every site on the net just not this one

I goto www.spectera.com and click on the provider locator image (which points to https://www.spectera.com:9001) I get you are not authorized to view this site.

I have the following configuration which I am sure is correct<Directory proxy:*>
order deny,allow
deny from 0.0.0.0
allow from 10.0.0.0/8 12.21.227.0/24 209.109.185.0/24 24.93.0.0/16
</Directory>

If this is just a configuration error I apologize but I don't think it is 





>Fix:
allow the proxy to pass ssl on any port above 1024 through a configuration variable that can be set by the user
