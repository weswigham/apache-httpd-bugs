3b7 treats it as if it were a GET
I reinstalled 3b6 and now everything works again.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you please double-check your scripts under 1.3b7 to
make sure they're getting the entire environment they
should be?  There's a known problem with CGI in 1.3b7
(see <http://Bugs.Apache.Org/index/full/2294>); can you
confirm that this is what you're encountering?

[Response from submitter]
Sorry, I'm a novice and all I'm sure of is that 3b6 works fine and
3b7 doesn't; it treats a POST as a GET. I did check your bug page
2294 and it sounds like my problem is probably related to what
folks are talking about there. I wish I knew more so that I could
constructively contribute. Meanwhile I'll wait for 3b8.

 Thanks for your response.  In the future, *please* do what the
 above says so that your response will go into the database?
 (You don't need to do it this time; I already did it for you.)

 Do you know CGI?  Are the scripts yours, or did they come from
 someone else?  How do you know requests are being passed to
 them as GET rather than POST?  I'm not familiar with CGI on
 Win32; if you're familiar with Unix, could you add the
 equivalent of a 'printenv' to one of your scripts?  If it's
 a BAT file, I think a "set" command with no arguments might do it.
 I'll see if I can get someone else to be more specific as to
 what you can try..

 OK.

 I know Perl better than cgi. The scripts I tried are Websearch
 (Burgdorf) and Guestbook (Wright). When you do a GET with the
 Websearch script, you get a list of the files the program will
 search; when you do a GET with Guestbook, you get a page saying
 "You seem to have left your name blank".
 
 These are the results I get when using 3b7. So I guess I don't
 really _know_, but the assumption seems logical.

 Sorry, I'm not familiar with Unix.

 It's not a BAT file. I'm calling the scripts from my browsers
 (Netscape 3.0 and Opera 3.21).

This problem is almost certainly caused by the 
known problem of missing environment variables in b7;
please try 1.3.1 when it is released, hopefully within a week.
