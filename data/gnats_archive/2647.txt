All attempts to add lines to httpd.conf result in:

Invalid command 'PerlModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined
by a module not included in the server configuration.

Same lines (e.g. PerlModule Apache::AuthenCache) work
fine in Apache 1.2.5.  What's going on here?  I noticed
PR #2347 (still open after a month and a half) was
getting same message.

How about some documentation somewhere about
"server configuration" related to mod_perl.
I've used every search engine I know and
I'll be damned if I can find anything.

 Erm... well, do you have mod_perl as part of your server?

 mod_perl is a third party module.  We can not support third party modules,
 nor should their documentation be included in the Apache distribution.
 
 The proper place to complain about third party modules not working is
 whatever third party the module may be from...

 i appreciate your prompt response, and yes i am
 running mod_perl (1.12).  i suppose i was taken in
 by all the hoopla about Apache/Perl integration
 and thought you might be of some help.  it is
 after all your error message.  if you can explain
 to me how i would "include" a module (any module)
 in the "server configuration" that might be
 of some help.  i tried adding a PerlModule line
 to the srm.conf file but that didn't help.  by
 the way we're not talking about any old random
 modules here, these are the Apache::ModuleName
 modules, and I can't get any of them to work 
 in Apache 1.3.0.
