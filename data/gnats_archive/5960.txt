>Description:
I installed apache 1.3.12 w/ php 3.0.15 on Solaris 7 w/ 128 megs of RAM

uname -a
SunOS webserver 5.7 Generic_106541-09 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2

The server runs fine for about an hour or so and then I start getting
a lot of these errors into the error_log:

[Wed Mar 29 12:23:26 2000] [crit] [client 205.188.208.231]
/home/fo/foobar/public_html/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: 
unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

That file is readable by all. When I restart apache the errors go away for
awhile and then comes back.

I initially thought that the problem had to do with open file descriptors,
so I placed "ulimit -n 2048" into the rc script that starts apache, and
just to confirm, I placed ulimit -a into the same script to make sure that
indeed my setting happened:

Current ulimit:
time(seconds) unlimited
file(blocks) unlimited
data(kbytes) unlimited
stack(kbytes) 8192
coredump(blocks) unlimited
nofiles(descriptors) 2048

I have posted this information to both the news group and the php mailing list
and have received no response. Checking the bug database, I notice this has
been reported before and there were patch releases for earlier versions of
apache. Those will not patch into this version. Someone also suggested 
(in one of the bug reports) to try and place -D_REENTRANT=1 into the CFLAGS
variable. I tried that, problem still happens.
