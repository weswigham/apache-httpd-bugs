 Dean, I agree with you, but there is no mention of this in any of the
 documentation for the windows version of Apache.  And if that number is set
 to anything other than 0 it is suicide for the entire server when the number
 is reached.  Since there is not "parent" executable program to spawn another
 apache session, there is nothing to take its place.
 
 All I am suggesting is ignore the setting.
 
 Thanks
 
 Dale

State-Changed-Why:
Brian Behlendorf added code to ignore this setting on Win32.
It appeared in 1.3b7.  Thanks for the report, and for
using Apache!
