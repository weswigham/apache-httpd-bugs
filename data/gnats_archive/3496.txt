State-Changed-Why:
Please STOP sending these repeated junk reports.  Not only
are you not making any sense in them, but you are not saying
how anything is related to Apache.

If your OS can't create files bigger than 2gb, then that
is an issue with your OS.  Many OSes have such limitations.
Unless you have a specific reason to think otherwise, I
don't see how Apache has anything to do with it.
