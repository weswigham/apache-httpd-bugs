>Description:
While trying to set up mod_dav with authenticated subdirectories, I came across
this problem.  It seems that if a Location section contains a limit section,
then and .htaccess file under the location is completely ignored.

By playing with permissions, I determined that the .htaccess file is at least
read by apache (or at least I get an error if it can't be read), even though it
ignores the contents.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following in httpd.conf:
Alias /test "/tmp/test/"
<directory /tmp/test>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
<location /test/1>
  AllowOverride All
  <Limit PUT POST DELETE PROPFIND PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK>
#  <LimitExcept GET HEAD OPTIONS>
      AuthType Basic
      Require user steve
      AuthUserFile /tmp/test/.htusers
  </Limit>
#  </LimitExcept>
</location>
 
Create the /tmp/test/1/2 and all parent directories.  Put the following
.htaccess file in /tmp/test/1/2:
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Directory"
AuthUserFile /tmp/test/.htusers
Require user tech
 
Create the /tmp/test/.htusers file with at least the tech and steve
users.  As long as the limit (or limitexcept) section is in the location
directive, the .htaccess is ignored.
>Fix:
Sorry, I have no idea.

 I must have accidentally hit submit twice.  This is the same entry as 
 PR#6937, so please delete this one.
