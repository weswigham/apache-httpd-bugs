Apache version 1.3.12 with mod_perl 1.2.3 running on Sun Solaris 5.7. Client PC running windows NT 4.0 (service pack 5).
>Description:
I am using IE5 to connect to an Apache web server. I have configured the web server to prompt me for a user ID and password when I enter a certain URL on the web server by using the following code :

NameVirtualHost 192.222.64.11:80

<VirtualHost 192.222.64.11>
    ServerName admin.cannon-hill.com
    DirectoryIndex /olhs-maint/olhs_mtnce.cgi
</VirtualHost>

   Alias /olhs-maint/ "/u02/olhs/maint/"
   
    <Directory "/u02/olhs/maint">
        Options Indexes Multiviews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        AuthName "Maintenance"
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/apache.passwd
        require valid-user
        satisfy all
    </Directory>

I have created the file apache.passwd using htpasswd. Using IE4 or any version of Netscape this works fine as I am presented with a login window for the user ID and password. With IE5 however I am taken straight to the 401 Authorization Required page. It is as if I have already mistyped either my user ID or password 3 times and do not have authority to enter the specified URL. Is this a 'feature' in IE5 and is there a workaround???

footnote, you want the comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
newsgroup.  Further, it sounds like IE was caching a prior p/w.
