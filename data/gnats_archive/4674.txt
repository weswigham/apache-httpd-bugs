Linux redhat 5.2 and 6.0, compiled with gcc
>Description:
Working in a reverse proxy situation. We have an application that sends  
a status line containing the following sequence

HTTP/1.0 SP SP 200 SP OK

SP = one space caracter

The proxy interprets this as a wrong header, because of the 2 SP caracters 
seperating the protocol definition and the status. It will then generat its 
own header. The real header will then be interpreted by the browser as a text.
For text/html content you will see the complete header being displayed by the 
browser. For images, they cannot be displayed since the browser is unable to 
understand the content. 

Iexplorer and Netscape browsers interpret this sequence as normal. The proxy 
should also interpret this as normal.

>How-To-Repeat:
make a simplpe nph- CGI script and print the wrong header
Access it through the reverse proxy.
>Fix:
parsing of the status line should admit multiple SP as seperators.
