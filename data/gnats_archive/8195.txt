PATCH: without any patch

>Description:
I'm writing apache modules using ap_* functions.

Looking at such html tag:
<FORM action="?act=1">

Use ap_parse_uri_componets() to parse the URI "?act=1", then use ap_unparse_uri_components() to recover the URI, you will get the different results, and the convert=>revert result is an empty string "".

This was not a problem in apache_1.3.14.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at the source code of apache_1.3.20/src/main/util_uri.c:line 250 is better.
Or insert following test code into apache to be called and do debug:
------------------
void test_ap_unparse_uri_components(pool *anypool)
{
  uri_components *uptr = ap_pcalloc(anypool, sizeof(uri_components));
  int status = ap_parse_uri_components(anypool, "?act=1", uptr);
  char *new_uri = ap_unparse_uri_components(anypool, uptr, 0);

  // verify the new_uri became empty here
  if (strlen(new_uri) == 0)
    // this shows the problem
    exit(1);
}
>Fix:
Add one line before 250 line of util_uri.c:
line 250: +)    if (uptr->path)
line 251:  )       parts[j++] = uptr->path;
