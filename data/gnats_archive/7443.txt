apache
>Environment:
Red Hat Linux release 7.0 (Guinness)
Kernel 2.4.1 on an i686
>Description:
I have a form and script that allows users to upload files of any size to the server. This worked fine on previous version of Apache (1.3.4), but since installing the new one I now get an error ONLY if the file is over 1 meg in size.

This is the error in the log file, and is definitely caused only when the file to be uploaded is over 1 meg. The error comes up immediately, ie its not a Timeout related error:

Malformed multipart POST
[Wed Mar 21 15:40:16 2001] [error] [client 203.17.36.12] Premature end of script headers: /www/docs/www.dbmsystems.com.au/upload/upload.cgi
