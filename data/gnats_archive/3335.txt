>Description:
Does your server provides FTP server together with http?

I don't think so. Please can you make a FTP server which
runs with the same apache.

I would not be difficult because most of the things can
be imported from HTTP.

Thank you.

State-Changed-Why:
No, Apache is a web server not a ftp server.  If you want a
ftp server get a ftp server.  We have no plans to try to do
the foolish "lets put everything in one program" thing.

This isn't really the appropriate place to ask questions
like this; the Usenet groups you are pointed to before you
submit a report would be more appropriate.

 I am extremely sorry :(
 
 I just wanted the best and free of bugs and reliable ftp server,
 and your httpd server is the best on the net. Won't you develop
 a separate program for it in near future?
 
 thanx anyway.
