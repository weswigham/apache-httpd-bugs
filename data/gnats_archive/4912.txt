SunOS umi-c001-m6 5.6 Generic_105181-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
When I try to startup Apache, I get the following error:
  fopen: No such file or directory
  httpd: could not open document config file /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
  /umi/www/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

My configure line looks as follows:

  CC=cc ./configure --prefix=/umi/www/apache \
	--enable-suexec --suexec-caller=umi \
	--enable-module=rewrite --enable-shared=rewrite \
	--enable-module=auth_dbm --enable-shared=auth_dbm \
	--enable-module=auth_anon --enable-shared=auth_anon \
	--enable-module=proxy --enable-shared=proxy

I also tried explicitly setting exec-prefix and sysconfdir, but that didn't 
help.  

This problem did not exist with version 1.3.6

Also, I don't directly install to the PREFIX (/umi/www/apache), but install with
the line:
  make install-quiet root=../..
Then I use Solaris packaging to actually package and install the file.  I don't 
think this is related, but including it for completeness.

 Er, nevermind.  This seems to be directly related to something I'm doing
 wrong with
 mod_perl.  It does work fine w/o mod_perl and I was mistaken when I said
 it worked under 1.3.6.
 
 Sorry to waste your time.
