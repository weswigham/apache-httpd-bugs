>Environment:
WinNT 4.0sp3, VC++ 5.0
>Description:
On a clean tar -xzf of the 1.3b3 dist, running nmake -f Makefile.nt _apacher 
fails when it tries to execute del CoreR\buildmark.obj.  nmake returns a 
fatal error and aborts the build. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Take the original tar file, uncompress it, cd into the src directory and
run nmake -f Makefile.nt _apacher
>Fix:
I commented that line out (line 21 of Makefile.nt: del CoreR\buildmark.obj)
and apache built just fine.  On sebsequent builds, with that line left
uncommented, apache built fine

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Mon Nov 24 17:54:13 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This has already been resolved shortly after the release
of 1.3b3.  The fix is to add a - in from of the del
to ignore errors.

Thanks for the report.
