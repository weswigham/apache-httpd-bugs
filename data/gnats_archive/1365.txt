SunOS 5.4 Generic_101945-34 sun4m sparc
>Description:
When a Internet Explorer client iniates a large download, seen at 400K, the file
is transmited in stages. This causes the sames file and transaction to be logged
seperate for each stage.  This in turn causes most log analysis to overstate the hit count for this document.  
Seen with IE3 & IE4, However not seen with Ntscpe 4.  

Didn't see this prior version.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you reproduce this at will?

Does it only happen on certain types of files?  eg. PDF files?

Can you show some sample log entries?

If IE is requesting the file in pieces, and it can do
so for most files using HTTP/1.1 byte ranges, then
Apache will log an entry for each request.  There isn't
anything else that Apache can do.

 with PDF files.

State-Changed-When: Sat Feb 14 05:24:35 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is normal for pdf files.  pdf files are byte-range served,
the client asks for pieces of the file as required.  ns3 will
do it as well if you have the right acroread version.
