PROBLEM:
Most free e-mail servers (which using PHP) could be vurnealble if user send an email with attachement for example test.php.php3.
Problem is if e-mail browser application detect php or php3 (and others) name (mostly just a extension) of that file is replaced by e-mail browser application, for exemple: test.php.#php3 but if
directive AddType application/x-httpd-php (in httpd.conf) contains multiple extensions PHP is still executable by PHP parser. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Just a make file test.php._php3 or ....php.#php3 .
But test.php.php3_ is not parsed.
Probably problem in Apache config parser (reader).

This problem can be solved when directive AddType application/x-httpd-php contains only one extension behind.
For example:
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Most documentations (PHP) recommending multiple extensions in one line.
