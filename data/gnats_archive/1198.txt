>Environment:
SuSE Linux 4.4.1 (kernel 2.0.29), gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
In the new features of version 1.3 it is mentioned that server generated
directory listings are sortable now. I have tried it on your web site and
liked that feature very much.

Now on my system, after compiling 1.3a1, the server does not generate the links in
the table header, although FancyIndexing is enabled.
>How-To-Repeat:
Place FancyIndexing On into srm.conf and access a directory without an index
file and without any other configuration in .htaccess.
