Apache and Jserv out of the box and were installed by Sun.
>Description:
A GET request is made in a loop : GET /servlets/prompts?prompt=num1 
where prompts is the name of the servlet and "prompt=num1" is a parameter
passed to the servlet. 

This works fine in almost all cases but occasionally, I get a "Not Found"
response back. The failure is quite rare but is there nevertheless.

The failure response (captured by ethereal was) :

State-Changed-Why:

This is almost certainly a jserv problem, so I suggest you
address it to the jserv developers, who now live at
http://jakarta.apache.org/

Thanks for using Apache.
