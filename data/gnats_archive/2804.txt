>Description:
If while Apache is running httpd.conf is edited to be syntatically incorrect
Apache will exit without any error logging.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run apache. Put garbage in httpd.conf. kill -1 apache-pid
>Fix:
Before restarting call `apachectl configtest` to test syntax of conf files. 
If syntax is wrong Log to syslog and/or STDERR. 
Then either exit or refuse to restart.
