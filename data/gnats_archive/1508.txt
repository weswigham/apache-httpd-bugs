win32 - all
>Description:
Fully qualified path (i.e. D:\mypath\apache) for passwd, documentroot and alias
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
in http_config.c: set_file slot, change the line:
    if (*arg == '/')
to:
    if (*arg == '/' || arg[1] == ':')
In util.c: chdir_file, add the line:
    if (x == NULL) x = strrchr(file, '\\');
after the line:
    x = strrchr(file, '/');
and the line:
{ char *cp ;for (cp = buf; *cp; cp++) if (*cp == '/') *cp = '\\'; }
after the line:
 buf[x - file] = '\0';

It works for me...
Thanks
