State-Changed-Why:

This problem will be handled by eliminating the Port directive in 2.0.
It has certainly caused many users grief.  The new syntax
will use Listen for port specification, and some entry like
ServerName to give the canonical 'name' of the server for
it's own use.

State-Changed-Why:
Re-opening for a couple of reasons.

1)  It isn't fixed yet.
2)  I believe this is a problem with IPv6 vs IPv4 config,
    and even if the directive names change, the behavior
    isn't going to.

I am looking into exactly what is happening and why now.

State-Changed-Why:
No feedback received...

If you want to pursue this further, try it on a recent
version of Apache 2.0 and see if the problem persists.  If so,
note that some platforms (e.g., NetBSD) only allow IPv6 connections to an IPv6 listening socket.  If this is
the case on your platform, you'll need two listen
statements per port so that Apache gets separate
IPv4 and IPv6 sockets.  Here is an example:

  Listen 0.0.0.0:80
  Listen [::]:80
Do this for each port.
See PR 7492 for additional discussion.  For now, that other
PR is suspended.
