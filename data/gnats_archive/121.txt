>Description:
In access.conf, I have FollowSymLinks set in the options for the DocumentRoot
directory.  Look at these links...

In /home/orgs/www/htdocs/ ...
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     other    23 Jan 22 01:30 pawx -> /home/orgs/weather/pawx
lrwxrwxrwx   1 www      www      23 Jan 22 01:45 pawx2 -> /home/orgs/weather/pawx
lrwxrwxrwx   1 www      www      30 Jan 22 01:49 dem -> /home/staff/demark/public_html

In /home/orgs/weather/ ...
drwxrwxr-x   7 www      pawx         512 Jan 20 21:35 pawx

In /home/staff/demark/ ...
drwxr-xr-x  12 other        512 Dec  5 19:34 public_html/

Now, http://www.ugems.psu.edu/pawx returns "Forbidden - You don't have permission to access /pawx on this server."
http://www.ugems.psu.edu/pawx2 returns "You don't have permission to access /pawx2/station.cgi on this server."
(Note that this link found the correct file to return, station.cgi, but didn't return it)
http://www.ugems.psu.edu/dem works fine (except for a clock cgi that doesn't like being requested
from a different server).

The first two cause the following lines to be added to the error_log...
[Wed Jan 22 02:01:54 1997] access to /home/orgs/www/htdocs/pawx/ failed for ajd3
.rh.psu.edu, reason: Symbolic link not allowed
[Wed Jan 22 02:01:57 1997] access to /home/orgs/www/htdocs/pawx2/station.cgi fai
led for ajd3.rh.psu.edu, reason: Options ExecCGI is off in this directory

Now, I have FollowSymLink and ExecCGI on in the directory.

What am I missing??

Thanks,
- Tony


>How-To-Repeat:
Go to the URLs mentioned above
>Fix:
Yeah, I could just move the "pawx" directory into the DocumentRoot... but that
would be too easy!   =%2

Have you resolved these problems yet?
Do you perhaps have any .htaccess files anywhere that are
changing the Options directive settings?
