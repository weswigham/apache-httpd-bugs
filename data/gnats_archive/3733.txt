>Environment:
OS/2, Warp 4, FP 8 (german), EMX 09d, gcc 2.8.2, 
bash or tcsh
>Description:
Configure creates makefile in modules, which is not correct:
in the line with :: after the backslashes a newline is 
missing.
The file ap_config.h defines MAXSOCKETS which is now defined
in socket.h
The macros STIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO and STDERR_FILENO
are not defined, #define STDXX_FILENO fileno(stdxx)
Production level code should not contain -g as OPTIM-flag 
but -O at least, yet -O2 preferred.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure under OS/2
>Fix:
Mentioned above, contact me for further questions

 The recommended shell to use is pdksh 5.2.13. See
 http://silk.apana.org.au/apache/ for information on building Apache under
 OS/2.
