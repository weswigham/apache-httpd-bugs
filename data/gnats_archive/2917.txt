>Environment:
OS/2 with GCC and EMX installed
>Description:
The conditional compiles are not quite right if DEBUG_INCLUDE_CMD
is set.  In particular, the FILE *dbg is defined twice and causes
the compile to fail.  I would be happy to send a fixed file though
such a minor change is hardly worth sending.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with __EMX__ flag set.
>Fix:
Move the 1st FILE *dbg to after the #else for __EMX__ test
and move the print to after the first #endif.
