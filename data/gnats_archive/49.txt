>Environment:
SGI Irix 5.3 / Apache 1.2b2 / Irix IDO and GCC 2.7.2 compilers.
>Description:
America Online issues an error about incompatible protocol versions when
attempting to access a site running on Apache 1.2.  This happens on all
sites we were able to test version 3 of AOLs browser on.  This did not happen
immediately after installing Apache 1.2 but rather it has been happening since
Friday 13th (heh)...this was almost a week after installing the upgraded version,
I think.
>How-To-Repeat:
Our site www.e-net.com as well as your site www.apache.org (and I'd assume
www.hyperreal.com) fail with version 3 of AOLs browser.
>Fix:
Since this happened about a week AFTER I installed the 1.2b1/2 upgrades, I'd
assume AOL has an incompatibility with HTTP1.1 and is explicitly blocking sites
returning HTTP/1.1 as protocol level.  This is only a semi-educated guess
