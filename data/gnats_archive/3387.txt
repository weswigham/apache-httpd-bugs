Linux eddie.sccd.ctc.edu 2.0.34 #3 Wed Aug 26 15:23:44 PDT 1998 i686 unknown
redhat 5.1, apache 1.3.1, gcc-2.7.2.3-11, glibc-debug-2.0.7-19, glibc-profile-2.0.7-19, glibc-devel-2.0.7-19, glibc-2.0.7-19

>Description:
I cannot pinpoint any specific time or reason that the server dies.   Just every 6 or 7 hours
the all the the httpd children will slowly die (within about 10 minutes) until there is
only one process left, the one owned by root.  I then stop and restart the server using the method
described on apaches web page ( kill -TERM `cat /var/run/httpd.pid`).  About every three days this
method of stopping and restarting the server does not work because it says the 
port (80) is still in use and there is no /var/run/httpd.pid file and I must reboot the server.  I have recompiled httpd
recently and it only caused the problem to be worse.  I also increased min and max
spare servers so as to ensure the server was not getting overloaded.  But this problem
does not seem to be related to the nubmer of processes running on the system.  
I'm also attaching a process and netstat report from when the server dies.  Don't
know if it will help or not, but I hope so.

 There is another thing I meant to report.  My Minspareservers is set to
 10.  But 
 the number of server processes regularly goes below 10, for example last
 time 
 before it died.  the number of httpd processes waiting was below 10 for
 over 35 minutes.
 Other times the server will go down to about 4 or 6 servers and stay
 there for a half hour before returning to the minspare server amount of
 10.
 Isn't the min spare servers suppossed to signify the least amount of
 spare servers
 that should be running?  So there should be no less than 10 for more
 than a few minutes?

 I also thought the following would be helpful:  This is the error log
 from this morning, it
 is confusing to me that the information messages say, for example,
 spawning 8, 9 idle, 49 total children while the ps ouput at that time
 shows only 18 processes.
 
 Attached are the error log for a certain period and below that is the
 number of proccesses
 running at each time corresponding to the error log.

 NOTE:
 Ther server stopped actually serving at around 9:40 though there were
 processes still running.  Also the number of processes in the list above
 does not include in the count
 the parent process which is owned by root.
 
 Is there any other info that would be useful?  An strace?

Yeah an strace of the parent when this problem occurs would be
most useful.

Thanks

Comment-Added:
Is your problem still occuring?  We're trying to track down
more information on problems like this because we think it
is a kernel bug.  An strace of the parent process when this
problem happens would be excellent...

 I ended up upgrading redhat and apache as well and the problem is no longer
 occuring.  When we were having the reported problem I could not get anything
 on the strace worth looking at, at least not that I could tell.  I know this won't
 help much but it would just repeat the same line over and over again.  I believe
 it was just the number of the process or something.  Sorry I can't help more.
