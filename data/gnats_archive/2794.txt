 a 100,000 instruction  cycles of each other
will get the same session id.


    /**
     * Get a session identifier. These should be unique identifier.
     */
    public static final String getIdentifier() {
        //Unless this takes less than 1 millis second that shouldn't
        //cause collision.
        return Long.toString( System.currentTimeMillis() );
    }

In addition the use of a time-stamp only ( or any other
predictable algorithm  ) has a big security hole when used
with cookies. Its trivial to program a client application
to emulate cookie presentation and knowing the current time 
search for a hit on a user's session.

Try something like this to fix the problem.

  static private int session_count = 0;

  /*
   * Create a suitable string for session identification
   * Use count and synchronized to ensure uniqueness.
   * Use timestamp because it useful in session timeouts.
   * Use random string to ensure timestamp cannot be guessed
   * by programmed attack.
   *
   * format of id is <random-hex-string>.<count>.<timestamp-ms>
   */
  static synchronized private String createSessionId () {
    String random = Long.toHexString(Double.doubleToLongBits(Math.random()));
    String time = Long.toString(System.currentTimeMillis());
    session_count++;	
    return random+SESSIONSEP+session_count+SESSIONSEP+time;
  }

>How-To-Repeat:
Not necessary - its a design flaw.
>Fix:
See code snippet.

Note I made this critical because its a possible mechanism to breach 
security of servers.
