>Description:
NOTE, I am not reporting a problem with a non-supported cgi-script.  There seems
to be a problem with embedding leading spaces after the initial "?" or after any
"&" in QUERY_STRING input.

If you still have access to the "test-cgi" script from the "cgi-pack" or if you
hae a simple cgi environment variable displayer do the following

    visit the script
	http://www.yourplace.com/test-cgi

it works fine.  Append to it "?a=b" or "?a=b&c=d" it will work fas expected.

If you instead append, "?    a=b" or "?a=b&    c=d", that part that begins
with the whitespace is shoved into the SERVER_PROTOCOL variable [on my system
at least).

I have not had time to look at mod_cgi or whatever other modules might handle
the splitting up of the environment but this would not seem to be correct
behaviour

State-Changed-Why:
Unencoded spaces are not valid in a request.  All spaces
must be % encoded (to %20).  Spaces are used to seperate
the method, the request URI, and the protocol.  Apache's
behaviour is correct.
