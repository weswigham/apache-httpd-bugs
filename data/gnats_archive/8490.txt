 Chocolate Baked Popcorn Gifts (New Black Business)=20
 
 Greetings Brothers and Sisters
 
 Aunt Marie's Gourmet  is a new African American owned business, that has cr=
 eated an original product: <B>Kettle Bake Popcorn ( The world's only Chocol=
 ated Baked Popcorn).</B> It will be the most wonderful tasting thing you've=
  ever had. We are doing an introductory offer on our <B>Six Pack Sampler: $=
 10 (Reg $20)</B> And also:<B>Does anybody like OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIES?</B> =
 Because Auntie's are the baddest in the world. We used to sell these to tho=
 se hard, thug brothers in the barber shops on Saturdays. And all of them we=
 re saying "Please, and Auntie may I have another." Brothers were walking ar=
 ound all week looking funny, because they spent all their money on cookies =
 instead of getting their hair cut. <B>And for just $36 our COOKIE SUBSCRIPT=
 ION</B> will send three months of these bad boys (One pound a month for thr=
 ee months, and that includes a note from you. We'll get with you about the =
 note) to all of your favorite homies. You decide when you want the first or=
 der to go out. So click on a picture to get to the web site. And then click=
  on "Order Popcorn," if you want the $10 six pack sampler, or "Cookie Subsc=
 ription," if you want the three month oatmeal raisins. <B>And if you do fou=
 r or more months,</B> we'll send a free order of the Chocolate Baked Popcor=
 n directly to you. <B>Now, on a more serious note. It's been said, by the h=
 aters, that black people don't have more businesses because we don't suppor=
 t the businesses we do have. I don't believe that, but the fact is, we sent=
  out 5000 of these messages in September, and 5 brothers and sisters out of=
  the whole 5000 decided to participate. Now, we don't want to take anything=
  away from Walmart or Blockbuster, or Amazon.com, because they already have=
  billions of your dollars. The only thing the brothers and sisters who work=
  here have is rent and child support payments. But it appears that the FATH=
 ER wants us to do this, because HE keeps bringing us back to it. But if we =
 don't make enough this month, we probably won't be around for November and =
 the Christmas season. We need to sell 278 three month subscriptions, or 100=
 0 six pack samplers by the end of October, to keep everybody employed. So t=
 here it is.</B>=20
 
 Small 1 quart cannister: Chocolate -- $7.50 (retail) whlsle12 pak case $4.0=
 0 per can 1-5 cases
 http://www.kettlebake.com
    We use five pounds of Ghirardelli's chocolate in the mixture for this fl=
 avor. We call it double chocolate.  It has a wonderful crunch and a deep ch=
 ocolate flavor. Small enough to fit in a gift basket (4-1/4 x 5-7/16).
 
 Large half gallon cannister: Chocolate -- $15.00 (retail) Whlsle 12 pk case=
  $8.00 per can 1-5 cases

    Same as the 1 quart cannister, only more of it.
 
 Losange Dress bag: 3.2 ounces -- $30.00 (retail 6pk) Whlsle 20 pak case $3.=
 00 per pak 1-5 cases

 Small 1 quart cannister: Praline -- $7.50 (retail) whlsle12 pak case $4.00 =
 per can 1-5 cases=20
 http://www.kettlebake.com
    You'd think we were crazy if we tried to explain how wonderful this tast=
 es. Once you've had it, you will understand. "Oh my goodness!" is most peop=
 le's response.=20
 
 Half gallon cannister: Praline -- $15.00 (retail) Whlsle 12 pk case $8.00 p=
 er can 1-5 cases

    The same "Oh my goodnesses". Only for a lot longer.=20
 
 Six pack sampler: 3.2 ounce Chocolate and Praline -- $10.00
 http://www.kettlebake.com
    A good, inexpensive way to taste the best popcorn in the world.=20
 
 Let's  just tell all those haters to <B>"Shut up!"</B> We're sending out a =
 lot of these messages, and I apologize if we spammed any of you. That wasn'=
 t the intention. Just trying to let y'all know we're here, for now. So if y=
 ou get this, please try the products and send the page on to 20 others. <B>=
 www.Paypal.com even lets you pay with an echeck if you don't have a credit =
 card.</B> Much love, and thank you in advance for your business. <B>Also, e=
 mail us if you would like to be a dsitributor of Kettle Bake baked popcorn,=
  which means everything you buy could be a write-off. Lower your taxes by g=
 iving gifts to your friends and loved ones. Can't do that at Walmart.</B>=
