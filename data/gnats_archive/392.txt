>Description:
In apache 1.2b8, the request

  GET http://pertsserver.cs.uiuc.edu/ HTTP/1.1

fails, while

  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: pertsserver.cs.uiuc.edu

succeeds.  The error log for the first request says:

  [Mon Apr 14 13:15:30 1997] access to / failed for pertsserver.cs.uiuc.edu, reason: client sent HTTP/1.1 request without hostname

My understanding is that they should both succeed.  The HTTP/1.1 
spec (RFC2068) says:

  5.1.2 Request-URI

   [...]
          Request-URI    = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path

   [...]

   An example Request-Line would be:

          GET http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1

   To allow for transition to absoluteURIs in all requests in future
   versions of HTTP, all HTTP/1.1 servers MUST accept the absoluteURI
   form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only generate
   them in requests to proxies.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, Apache is behaving correctly.  From RFC 2068,
section 14.23

"  A client MUST include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request
   messages on the Internet (i.e., on any message corresponding to a
   request for a URL which includes an Internet host address for the
   service being requested). If the Host field is not already present,
   an HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST add a Host field to the request message prior
   to forwarding it on the Internet. All Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers
   MUST respond with a 400 status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message
   which lacks a Host header field."

Thanks for the report, though, and for using Apache!
