>Environment:
HP-UX aenet1 B.11.00 A 9000/735
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
This is perl, version 5.005_03 built for PA-RISC1.1
>Description:
Whenever attempting to use ./htpasswd -c filename username

it returns with error:

# ./htpasswd -c users bob
New password:
Re-type new password:
./htpasswd: unable to create temporary file
fopen: No such file or director


But i copied the htpasswd executable from another apache version 1.3.6 into the
same directory, and did the "htpasswd -c users bob" and it created the password 
file users with the username "bob" without a problem. Also the permissions on
file and directory are set correctly. What gives?

I'm running mod_ssl with openssl 2.9.4 together with apache.

thanks,
Vinnie

Something in the script htpasswd is attempting to open a directory or file that
does exit!?

State-Changed-Why:
Please try this again after upgrading to Apache 1.3.12.
If you still have the problem let me know and I'll send you
a patch from the next version of htpasswd, which is a little
more vocal about its problems in this area.
