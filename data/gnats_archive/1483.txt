>Environment:
Linux 2.0.32 (RedHat 4.2+), GCC 2.7.2
>Description:
Given a conf containing "ProxyPass /other.machine.edu http://other.machine.edu",
Apache 1.2.4 fetches & maps the following URL into the namespace of the current
server:

  https://current.server.edu/other.machine.edu/index.html <-
     http://other.machine.edu/index.html

Unfortunately, if http://other.machine.edu/index.html has any relative links
on it, they do not work.  For example, if http://other.machine.edu/index.html
has a link like <IMG SRC="/graphics/logo.gif">, this link should be mapped as
follows:

  /graphics/logo.gif ->
     https://current.server.edu/other.machine.edu/graphics/logo.gif <-
        http://other.machine.edu/graphics/logo.gif

Unfortunately, this is what happens:

  /graphics/logo.gif ->
     https://current.server.edu/graphics/logo.gif

Normally such mappings result in "broken" links.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
No suggestions; I'm only now looking at the source.  But I'd be happy to try
out patches for you, and try to work things out.

I feel really stupid - as if I've missed something obvious.  If so, then this
is a documentation bug, and not a software bug, seeing as I did not find a ready
solution to the problem in the documentation.

I'd be happy to help rewrite the relevant section of the docs, if that turns out
to be the problem.

Thanks...

State-Changed-Why:
That is not entirely a relative URL you are giving; it
has a full path, and the only thing it is relative to
is the current server.  A true relative URL would be
graphics/logo.gif or ../graphics/logo.gif, etc.

Apache does not do any parsing of the HTML to try to
find such things.  Any attempt is really doomed to failure,
because there are so many different places they could
be.  eg. anchors, Javascript, etc.

This could be called suboptimal, but it would be a _LOT_
of work to implement a correct HTML parser, and even then
it wouldn't be complete.  You really need the cooperation
of the remove site to use directory relative URLs, not just
server relative URLs.  This can be a pain, but...
