>Description:
We are trying to use apache2 to provide reverse proxy services in the same way as we use apache1.3, https://servername/server1/pages.xxx is requested from http://seerver1/pages.xxx. This works in 1.3 but in 2.0.32 we get
 [Fri Mar 15 17:50:44 2002] [error] mod_ssl: SSL error on writing data (OpenSSL library error follows)
[Fri Mar 15 17:50:44 2002] [error] OpenSSL: error:140D0114:SSL routines:SSL_write:uninitialized
[Fri Mar 15 17:50:44 2002] [error] mod_ssl: failed to write 16 of 16 bytes (reason unknown).

Requesting ssl encrypted pages off the actual server itself works fine. Its onl when we try and use the proxying capabilities that we fail.
