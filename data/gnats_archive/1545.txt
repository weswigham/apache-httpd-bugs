>Description:
Sending the content of the gif file using the following perl source (
or even C program), I got an empty result document.  However, 
if I open the gif file directly under Netscape, it is OK.
>How-To-Repeat:
#!c:\perl\bin\perl

print "Content-type: image/gif\n\n"; 
open F, "c:/www/us/en/what1but.gif"; 
while (read F, $r, 16384) { print $r; } 
close F; 
exit 0;
