>Description:
Below is a portion of our httpd.conf. The FYI I left others in my org. should explain every thing in context better than a diatribe from me. After that is the text/* segment of our mime.types file.

ServerName www.musicyellowpages.com
AddType text/x-server-parsed-html .shtml
AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .cgi
AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .pl
AddType text/x-server-parsed-html .html
AddType text/x-server-parsed-html .htm
AddType text/x-server-parsed-html .inc

ExpiresActive on
ExpiresByType application/x-httpd-cgi A120
ExpiresByType text/x-server-parsed-html "access plus 120 seconds"
# Doesn't work
# ExpiresByType text/html A120
###FYI undocumented quirk: mod_expires uses the initial mime/type for the
# file and not the served mime/type. ie; since we are using *.htm
# in place of *.shtml, our internal mime/type is parsed (via addtype)
# however the output is just text/html since this is derived from the
# file mime.types
# In other words AddType overrides mime.types declarations when dealing
# with a file internally yet fails to override those declarations in
# the header sent to the client. mod_expires doesn't pull mime/types from
# mime.types or at least not until it has checked the current env. for
# AddType declarations.

ExpiresByType text/html A120
# OK, it works but not on *.htm, *.html, *.inc, *.cgi, and *.pl exts.
# Maybe, we should use *.shtml for static pages
# Header append Cache-Control must-revalidate

# mime.types file segment
text/html                      html htm
text/x-sgml                     sgml sgm
text/plain                     txt
text/richtext                  rtx
text/tab-separated-values      tsv
text/x-setext                  etx
>How-To-Repeat:
use *.htm and *.html as a text/server-parsed-html mime/type using AddType directive as above. Then use ExpiresByType text/html A###. The output headers will show Content-Type: text/html but no Expires: header.
>Fix:
Just document it with the mod_expires directives and if this is more serious than I think it is, put it onto the "Maybe Tommorrow, TODO list".

State-Changed-Why:

Try following the directions in the mod_include
documentation; instead of using "AddType text/x-..."
use "AddType text/html .htm" and "AddHandler server-parsed .htm"
and see if that works better for you.
