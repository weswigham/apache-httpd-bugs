Solaris 2.6 and Redhat Linux 6.0 with 2.2.14 kernel.
>Description:
After upgrading from ApacheJServ1.1b3 to ApacheJServ1.1 final, the POST method in my JSP pages no longer worked.  It seems that GET works fine still.

I Have Apache 1.3.11 with JServ 1.1 (compiled from source as a module).  I am using tomcat as the servlet/jsp engine.  Tomcat works fine if I use the web tomcat web server on port 8080.  

I have downgraded back to 1.1b3 and it works again.
