not online since this is a local production server. Same stuff on the Unix Apache server on the web works (currently 1.2.4) Going to upgrade to 1.3.1 next weekend and expect that it works there. I think it's win32 only.

 Are you sure you didn't misspell anything in the configfile?
 
 Does anything appear in the error log?

 Why do you expect "require user1 user2" to work?  As the docs clearly
 state, if you want to require specific users you need to do "require user
 user1 user2".

 I'm sure. However, today I upgraded our BSDI Apache and checked it out. 
 Worked (as expected). Then re-checked the win32 setup and found that it is 
 mysteriously now working there as well. I did not change the setup except 
 that I first replaced the old password file with the one from the Unix server 
 and after this tried with the original. Both worked. This must have been an 
 issue of too many apache and browser stops and restarts and changes of the 
 .htaccess file. Maybe I was to unpatient, although I worked at least one or 
 two hours on the problem before I gave up.

 This was a typo resulting from copy and paste of the above valid-user line. 
 It would have been a bug then, anyway ;-)
 
 
 So, everything is fine. Sorry for the false alarm.
