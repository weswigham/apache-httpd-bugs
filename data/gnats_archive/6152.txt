IRIX 6.5.8 - gcc compiler, full patchlevel.
>Description:
Apache compiles and installs with no problems straight out of the box.
All the webservers work. But all the IP addresses of the clients are logged as 0.0.0.0. This is affecting my desired security, as I'd like to restrict access based on client IP. no matter what IP address the client comes from, it is always considered to be 0.0.0.0.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well, I just unpacked apache, ran ./configure, then make, then make install. Couldn't be simpler!
>Fix:
Maybe some IRIX problem not returning the IP address. But I doubt it.
