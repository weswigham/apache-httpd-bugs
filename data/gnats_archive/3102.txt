>Description:
1. Added the following virtual host entry:

<VirtualHost grelmstavern.wonderdigital.com>
ServerAdmin grelm@wonderdigital.com
DocumentRoot /usr/local/www/grelmstavern/data
ServerName grelmstavern.wonderdigital.com
Errorlog /usr/home/user/grelm/weblog/http-error.log
TransferLog /usr/home/user/grelm/weblog/http-access.log
</VirtualHost>

2. When page is accessed as grelmstavern.wonderdigital.com, I get the basic web page for the server. When I type in: grelmstavern.wonderdigital.com/index.html, I get the proper page.

>How-To-Repeat:
See Full description..

grelmstavern.wonderdigital.com is the web site in question.
>Fix:
No.

State-Changed-Why:
First of all, there is no 1.2.8 release. What version of
Apache are you actually running? If it is a 1.2.x release,
you should seriously consider upgrading to 1.3.2.

Also, I don't see the problem you are referring to. The
same page is coming up with and without /index.html on 
my browser. Please elaborate on what your specific problem
is.
