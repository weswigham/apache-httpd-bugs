>Description:
I tried the following line in our Apache 12b8:
 
ErrorDocument 404 http://saarland/cgi-sz/test.cgi    

test.cgi looks like this :

#!/usr/bin/csh
echo "content-type: text/plain"
echo ""
setenv

In case of error 404 the script shows correctly the environment
however I can't see anywhere any REDIRECT_ vars like REDIRECT_URL
as mentioned in the Apache docs. The same works fine with Apache 12b8
under Linux.

Any idea ?
