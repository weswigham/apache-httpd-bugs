>Description:
I am running apache 1.3.12 on solaris 2.7
Once every 4 hours (cron) I move the apache logs and then send a kill -USR1 <apache pid> command to apache to recycle them. I then archive the logs. After about a week apache stops responding and the message in the error log says too many open files Accept: (client socket)
I tried raising the file descriptor limit but that just makes it last a bit longer. Sound like a leak maybe or something is wrong with the kill command. This wasnt posted on the news group, I tried but had problems with deja (sorry)
>How-To-Repeat:
Run apache 1.3.12 and send a kill -USR1 <apache pid> every minute. Should stop responding in about an hour
>Fix:
Maybe use a different signal in the kill command

 I have some updated info. We had configured apache with Jserv support. Some
 time in the future we expected to use some java servlets, so we thought
 that it would be prudent to add the jserv to our present configuration.
 However if you recompile apache and remove the jserv support. The open
 files problem goes away. Even with the kill -USR1 <apache pid> command
 running every minute. So it seems that somehow Jserv is either causing or
 revealing this problem.
 
 Thanks,
 Chuck

State-Changed-Why:
mod_jserv (as of 1.1.3) does indeed have a file descriptor leak.
It's related to the log files -- basically, the pool function
wasn't being used, and so no cleanup was happening.  The
following patch may resolve the issue:

     if (filedesc==-1) {
         char *buf=ap_pstrcat(p,"file '",filename,"' can't be opened",NULL);
         return buf;

This may at some point be committed to the JServ CVS tree, but
no further releases are planned.  I'm entering this information
in case someone else has problems with apache leaking file
descriptors during graceful restarts or ordinary restarts (
via the HUP or USR1 signals).
