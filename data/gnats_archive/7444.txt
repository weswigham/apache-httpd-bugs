>Description:
Two problems really using "htpasswd -m" under Solaris 2.6

Firstly the Solaris getpass() called by ap_getpass.c only returns the first 8 characters or the password you type. This is fine when using crypt() password hashes but we want to use md5 with longer (10 - 12 character) passwords. Sun have now introduced getpassphrase() to support 256 character passwords. Maybe this should be called instead.

Secondly the salts generated when using "htpasswd -m" are only 2 or 3 bytes long with "."s filling in the rest. I've looked at the source in ap_to64() and the fault seems to lie there. The value of "v" in the loop of "n" from 8 to 1 seems to reach zero after 2 or 3 iterations. I'll try it under Linux tonight but it's certainly not behaving as expected under Solaris 2.6.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Call getpassphrase() instead of getpass() when building on Solaris 2.6 ( and 7 and 8) by the looks of it. Sun decide to introduce getpassphrase() rather than extending getpass() therefore requiring all programs that call it to be modified, but probably protecting themselves against any side effects introduced by changing the behaviour of getpass().

The loop to generate a random salt seems a bit over complicated maybe something simpler would ensure it works on all Unixes.
