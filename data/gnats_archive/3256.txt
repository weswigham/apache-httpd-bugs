Thanks for your suggestion, Marc.  Here's what works so far:

I downloaded and used apache 1.3.3 (although my guess is that scenarios
below hold also for 1.3.2).

I can compile apache 1.3.3 either static or DSO and it will execute
scripts ok.

But when I add mod_perl in as DSO module during the initial build, it
will not execute scripts.  I got a fresh mod_perl-1.16.tar.gz from
perl.apache.org today.  Used these parms to configure mod_perl:
#!/bin/bash
# 981020
# make command for mod_perl.1.16
perl Makefile.PL \
   APACHE_SRC=../apache_1.3.3/src \
   DO_HTTPD=1 \
   USE_APACI=1 \
   PREP_HTTPD=1 \
   EVERYTHING=1

 I haven't tried mod_perl statically yet, nor adding it as module after
building and testing apache without it.

And, no, I definitely am not building with suExec.
