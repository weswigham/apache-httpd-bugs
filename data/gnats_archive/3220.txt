Win95 osr2 (releaseb) w/ y2k patch; precompiled win32 binary
running TCP/IP and backup exec clients (network related software)
>Description:
Bluescreen:
A fatal exceptoin 0E has occurredat 0028:C0231800 in VXD VMM (0d) + 00001800.  The current application will be terminated. 
It then procedes with a bunch more bluescreens-- I have to reboot, it doesn't recover. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I assume (i've done this) that a win95b install and apache will provide a duplication.
From there browsing the network neighborhood should produce this once you select a file to open.
It sometimes (rarely) will let you open the file, but a few attempts should give you a bluescreen.
I also have Office97, and backup exec client installed as well as Dr. Soloman's Antivirus.
I also have ssh client for windows and 
WAR ftp daemon installed, but rarely running.
Thanks for porting a Windows flavour, I've used apache for linux for a while-- now we can have a real web server for our NT and 95 boxes!

 Huh?  What does browsing the network neighborhood have to do with Apache?

 Sorry, guess I was a little vague.  Once I'd installed apache on my win95
 box I began to have this problem (bluescreen from network neighborhood).  I
 originially figured it was a win95 feature so i reinstalled my box from
 scratch and the problem was fine until I installed apache again.  My guess
 is that there is some sort of shared memory violation with the TCP/IP stack
 or something else way over my head.  Ordinarily I'd just look for something
 else to run, but I like apache too much to dismiss it right away.
 Hopefully this makes more sense...

 I'm really doubtful that this is an Apache problem.  There really isn't
 much we can do to solve it.  Win95 can start being unstable because you
 look at it the wrong way...
 
 Does it happen if Apache isn't running at all?
