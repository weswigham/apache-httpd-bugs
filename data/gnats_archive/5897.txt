Sun Sparc Solaris 2.6, with gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I have a proxypass situation and would like to add cache-control headers to the
proxy'd pages.  Specifically, I'd like to cache dynamic content that
is of the form http://other.server.com/querydir/somequery.show_parms

E.g.,

<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
  ProxyPass /querydir/ http://other.server.com/querydir/
</IfModule>

<LocationMatch "*show_parms">
  Header append Cache-Control "max-age=28800,public"
</LocationMatch>

Of course, it doesn't work.  I can't make LocationMatch work on any proxy'd
pages.  I believe the manual alludes to using <Directory> but that is inappropriate
for a proxypass.

I've posted on usenet and waited a week and half with no replies.

>Fix:
Please make LocationMatch work with mod_proxy.
