>Description:
Modify http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/examples.html

Add example for doing name-based virtual hosting with multiple ports since this isn't very intuitive. (ie If you don't define the ports with NameVirtualHost it won't work)

NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80
NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4:8080

<VirtualHost www.site1.com:80>
 ServerName www.site1.com
 DocumentRoot /web/https-site1/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.site1.com:8080>
 ServerName www.site1.com
 DocumentRoot /web/https-site1-8080/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.site2.com:80>
 ServerName www.site2.com
 DocumentRoot /web/https-site2/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.site2.com:8080>
 ServerName www.site2.com
 DocumentRoot /web/https-site2-8080/
</VirtualHost>

Yes, this is a good suggestion, thanks! We'll add it
to the documentation if you write a complete entry like
the others in vhosts/examples.html and provide us with a
diff.

 Well I can honestly say this is the first time anyone has asked me to 
 create a patch for a web page.  But anyway here it is:
