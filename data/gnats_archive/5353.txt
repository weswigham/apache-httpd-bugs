>Description:
If I create a location using

<Location /path/more/>
...
  AddHandler handler .ext
</Location>

and then access http://server/path/more/file.ext (thus invoking the handler 
for .ext files in the location), PATH_INFO will contain /more/file.ext, and
not /path/more/file.ext. Apache always removes the first element from the 
virual path, i.e. a <Location /path/> would result in /file.ext being sent in
as PATH_INFO, with the preceding path missing.

>How-To-Repeat:
No URL avail.
>Fix:
The problem seems to be in http_request.c. The function get_path_info()
will not work correctly if all it finds are directories, but no files.
My line 259 says:

if (S_ISDIR(r->finfo.st_mode) && last_cp) {
     r->finfo.st_mode = 0;   /* No such file... */
     cp = last_cp;
}

find_path_info() walks backward through the requested path, after it has been mapped
to the DocumentRoot (i.e. /opt/docroot/path/more/file.exe in above example),
and looks for non-virtual components. It finds /opt/docroot/, and so it sets 
PATH_INFO (cp in this case) to the last path it examined (minus
the document root) which was "/more/file.exe". 

Removing the line "cp = last_cp" solves the problem in this case, but I'm sure
it was there for a good reason!
