>Description:
The environment variables QUERY_STRING(!!!) and SCRIPT_NAME are not
set correctly when MultiViews is used to get to a CGI script.

QUERY_STRING is not set at all and SCRIPT_NAME has the script's base name
and PATH_INFO inserted into it.

>Fix:
No.  I'm guessing it's a by-product of some of the security "enhancements"
but I haven't gotten into them.

For now, I'm pulling QUERY_STRING from REQUEST_URI but that's just wrong.
