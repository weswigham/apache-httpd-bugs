documentation update
>Description:
In your frequently asked questions html documentation, you might want to add
another cause of "premature end of script header" errors. If a server is
running suEXEC and the target uid/gid mismatches with the directory or program,
the apache error log will often note it as a "premature end of script header"
error. You can still find the exact cause of the error in the suexec log, but
to prevent administrators from carelessly overlooking this simple mistake, it
might be a good idea to add this to the FAQ.
