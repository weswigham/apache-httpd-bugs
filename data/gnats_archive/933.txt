>Description:
I've been thinking about name-based <VirtualHost> and trying to make it adequately compatible with old web browsers.
I have already implemented the solution you suggest of having the virtualhost directories also available as directories on the main server,
but I think that using different port numbers would be better because the HTML writers would be able to specify relative URL's beginning with '/' if they wanted.
There are enough ports free on most machines to satisfy typical virtual-server requirements.
So, I'm suggesting that the same files be accessible as http://www.virtual.com/ and http://host.site.edu:8123/ and possibly http://host.site.edu/virtual/
>How-To-Repeat:
<virtualhost www.virtual.com host.site.edu:8123>  will not work for name-based vhosts.
>Fix:
Change the parsing of name-based virtual hosts to allow different port numbers. The in-depth explanation says that any port other than the default will be treated as an ip-based virtual host

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, a rewrite of vhosts will be done someday.  What you ask
for may already be possible, but I wouldn't count on it working
right.  The vhost support works well if your server is entirely
name based, or entirely ip-based.  Or entirely port-based.

BTW, port-based stuff is a bad idea for various reasons.  Including
lame corporate firewalls that only allow people to use http
on port 80.
