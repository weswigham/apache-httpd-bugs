Once I enabled a directory index, the icons weren't found.
Looking in the log file I discovered this.

Apache: [Fri Apr 16 14:04:00 1999] [error] [client 205.147.59.28] Filename is not valid: c:/program files/apache group/apache/icons"text.gif

I changed the line in httpd.conf from:

Alias /icons/ "c:\program files\apache group\apache\icons\"

to:

Alias /icons/ "c:\program files\apache group\apache\icons/"

and it's now working.

Note: I'm not using 1.3.6 because I can't control access with it.  1.3.4 allows plain text to work in a user file.

That's all.

State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 12:11:50 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/
