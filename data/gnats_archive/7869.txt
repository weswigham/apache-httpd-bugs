Apache 1.3.20
PHP 4.0.4 pl1
>Description:
I get "Internal Server Error" and the error-log states:
"malformed header from script. Bad header=HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized: c:/drivers/php/php.exe"
when running a PHP script which requests HTTP Authentication.

I was running 1.3.19 when I encountered the problem, and an upgrade to 1.3.20 did not solve my problem.
I copied the file (a very small test-script, see below) to a Linux machine where it worked like a dream. (I get the message box promping me for a user/password)
In the Linux (RH 6.2) machine I'm running 1.3.12 / PHP4.0.4pl1.


PHP Code snip:
<?
if(!isset($PHP_AUTH_USER)) 
{
  $COMPANY_NAME = "SourceTech AB";
  header("WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"The Realm of $COMPANY_NAME\"");
  header("HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized");
  echo "<H3>Error bla bla try again</H3>\n";
  exit;
} 
 else // A password is entered...
{
  // We dont get this far
}
?>

State-Changed-Why:
"HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized" is a HTTP header, it is not a
valid header for a CGI script to output, so Apache is doing exactly what it should be doing.  I do not know
why PHP is behaving differently; perhaps it is compiled as a module on the Unix system or perhaps it is setup to change the header to a valid one.  

In any case, there is nothing Apache can or should do about this.  Only nph- scripts (see the docs) are allowed to output the HTTP status line, other scripts need to use "Status:" to set the status.
