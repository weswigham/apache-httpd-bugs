>Release:        1.3.2
>Environment:
Win32, Apache 1.3.2
>Description:
Whenever I start Apache I get a warning "[warn] pid file c:/apache/logs/httpd.pid overwritten -- Unclean shutdown of previous apache run?"

This happened only in Apache 1.3.2 (Win32), not in previous Win32 versions.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have noticed that deleting the logs/httpd.pid file fixes the problem, but you have to do it each time you close the server.
