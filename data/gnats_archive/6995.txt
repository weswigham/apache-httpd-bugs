>Description:
I used the AddDescription directive to add some descriptions to some subdirectories. For some reason the description I entered for the dir 'rsw2000' was also applied to the dir 'rsw2000_2'. ??

so the output became:

rsw2000/                18-Dec-2000 23:55      -  RSW 2000 - Scouts
rsw2000_2/              18-Dec-2000 23:55      -  RSW 2000 - Scouts

instead of:

rsw2000/                18-Dec-2000 23:55      -  RSW 2000 - Scouts
rsw2000_2/              18-Dec-2000 23:55      -  RSW 2000 - Scouts (2)

which I expected..
>How-To-Repeat:
make a directory with two subdirectories:

/rsw2000
/rsw2000_2

create an .htaccess (fancyindexing = on) file with:

AddDescription "RSW 2000 - Scouts" rsw2000
AddDescription "RSW 2000 - Scouts (2)" rsw2000_2

>Fix:
When I put the AddDescription lines in reverse order (rsw2000_2 first), everything works fine..
I do not have control over the order in which the AddDescription are added to the .htaccess file..
