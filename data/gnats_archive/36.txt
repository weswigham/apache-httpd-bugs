>Description:
I have a .htaccess & .htpasswd file in a directory that will not authenticate.
I have checked the server config (access.conf) and everything appears correct.
the following is a sample of my .htaccess:

AuthUserFile /home/mixer/public_html/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName Hollywoodlove
AuthType Basic

<Limit GET POST>
require user brad
require user wishbone
require user mixer  
</Limit>

and here is my .htpasswd:

mixer:EFUDJlC91PvSk
wishbone:EF60tUknjzJSU
brad:EFboiNahRkO1E

and here is my access.conf:

# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
# override. Can also be "All", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo", 
# "AuthConfig", and "Limit"

AllowOverride None

# Controls who can get stuff from this server.

order allow,deny
allow from all

</Directory>

# /home/httpd/cgi-bin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.

<Directory /home/httpd/cgi-bin>
AllowOverride None
Options None
</Directory>

Now all of this looks correct and there are no HOWTO's that I can find and I have read
all of the FAQ's and the online docs at your web site and am still confused as to 
why this setup does not work....
Please mail me a response (verbose) as to what I may have done wrong or what the bug may be
and a correction for it.

Thank you

State-Changed-Why:

Your access.conf contains

   AllowOverride None

which prevents interpretation of .htaccess files.
This is explained in the documentation of AuthConfig.
