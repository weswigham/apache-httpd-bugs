>Description:
Dear reader,
The current docu for ErrorDocument says:
"...
The syntax is, 

     ErrorDocument <3-digit-code> action 

     where the action can be, 
        1.Text to be displayed. Prefix the text with a quote ("). Whatever follows the quote is displayed. Note: the (") prefix
          isn't displayed. 
..."

My question is: can you use multiple lines (with \ as continuator) or are
you bound to one (1) line (ie. upto and including the newline)?
I'm going to experiment with this carefully, but I hesitate to do frequent
restarts of the server to test this, because I don't want the server to be
offline too often...
Kind regards,
Eric Maryniak
>How-To-Repeat:
n/a
>Fix:
Text:
1.Text to be displayed. Prefix the text with a quote ("). Whatever follows
  the quote __upto and including the newline__ is displayed. Note: the (") prefix
          isn't displayed.

State-Changed-Why:

Suggest you install a second instance of apache in another
location, or create a second config in the same location
with it's own httpd.conf, within that renaming any lock,
pid, and log files, for testing and experimentation.
