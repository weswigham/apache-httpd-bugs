>Description:
dbmmanage is irregular. it will cut passwords at the number '0'
and often return the terminal in an irregular state.

also, it asks for the password twice, and if a '0' is in the first
password, it will skip the second prompt.
>How-To-Repeat:
dbmmanage ./bob.dbm adduser llorax
New password: [120979]
Confirm Password:
Passwords do not match!!!
>Fix:
sub getpass { $prompt = shift || "Enter Password: "; print $prompt;
$pwd = <STDIN>; chomp($pwd);
die "Cannot use empty password\n" unless length $pwd;
return $pwd; }

State-Changed-Why:
Your suggested getpass() function is not accepable, because
it doesn't hide the password from printing on the terminal.
But we at least can fix the existing getpass() function
to work correctly even for passwords with "0" chars. 
I've fixed it for 1.3b7 now. The incorrect state of
your terminal I cannot reproduce. Actually the usage
of "stty -echo" and "stty echo" is the correct and
most portable way to do it. I don't know of any other
way. But that's not to dramatically. At least the
"0" problem is now fixed. Thanks for your feedback.
