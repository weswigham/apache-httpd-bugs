State-Changed-Why:
Agreed that it is useful, however we do not wish to change
the format of that at this time.  You can get something
similar by using mod_log_config, logging the referrer
and pulling all the 404's out of it, but it is arguably
not as handy.

This should be revisited after 1.2 comes out.
