>Description:
In performing this configuration, I decided to try out the new configuration 
procedure.  In doing so, I notice an apparent oversight in that at the
configure time, one is unable to set variables to be used in the compilation
easily.  I was trying to set HARD_SERVER_LIMIT without having to directly
modify the include/httpd.h file.  I tried modifying the Configuration.tmpl
but that did not work either.  However, modifying the Configuration.tmpl did
work for setting the OPTIM and LD_EXTRA_LIBS and LD_EXTRA_FLAGS 

In looking over the distribution
I'd like to do this in an "official" nice manner....but how? 

BTW, before asking the question, I did do distcleans between each generation 
just to be sure.
>How-To-Repeat:
Maybe I am missing something or overlooking something but I changed the
EXTRA_CFLAGS variable to 

  -DHARD_SERVER_LIMIT=512 

to no avail.
>Fix:
I'm without a clue....the unnice way is of course modifications through
include/httpd.h but there must be a way to do this....there must be....:-%2

State-Changed-Why:
You didn't read the INSTALL file carefully enough:
There is a note especially for you:

     NOTE: Although we'll often advice you to read the src/Configuration.tmpl
           file parts to better understand the various options in this
           section, there is at no time any need to _EDIT_ this file. The
           _COMPLETE_ configuration takes place via command line arguments to
           the ./configure script. The src/Configuration.tmpl file is a
           read-only resource, here.

In other words: Configuration.tmpl should
not be edited. Neither when using the old nor when
using the new configuration scheme. Instead use

$ CFLAGS="-DHARD_SERVER_LIMIT=512" ./configure ...

Please read INSTALL again. Thanks.
