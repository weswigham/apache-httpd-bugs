>Organization:
>Environment:
win95a
>Description:
No matter what dial-up connection I try, apache cannot auto detect my ip/dns name,
causing me to have to find it out and plug it in.  I am prevented from testing 
apache while not being connected, as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
leave the servername global directive "absent"
>Fix:
I would suggest in http.conf putting a comment that told people to use
127.0.0.1 as an option if they are not connected or are testing apache locally.
It will help people just "test" it and not have to look up their ip every time,
etc, to get it working.

State-Changed-Why:
Although the decision on the method isn't final, we are
addressing your concern in the Apache 1.3.13 release.
Please note that Apache is not built for dynamic IP
environments, so your mileage may vary :-)
