>Description:
Directory indexing includes symbolic links, even if the FollowSymLinks or
SymLinksIfOwnerMatch option is turned off.  Thus, the indices output by
the module include links to URLs which Apache should know will return a
"403 Forbidden" error.

It would be nice if mod_autoindex could decide based on the FollowSymLinks
and SymLinksIfOwnerMatch options whether a symbolic link should be included
in a directory listing.  (Failing that, an IndexOptions keyword which could
select the file types to be included in the listing might be useful.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a symbolic link under a document tree where FollowSymlinks and
SymLinksIfOwnerMatch are off (or create a symbolic link belonging to
a different user from the target where SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is on).  Make
sure "Options Indexes" is turned on.  Get Apache to produce an index for
the directory; it will include an entry for the symbolic link, but following
the hyperlink will produce "403 Forbidden."
>Fix:
Have mod_autoindex check whether Apache would permit the symbolic link
to be followed.  Since doing so could potentially degrade performance (e.g.,
because checking SymLinksIfOwnerMatch would require Apache to stat() the
target of the symlink in order to compare owners), add a keyword to
IndexOptions controlling whether or not the check should be made (e.g.,
"IndexOptions +StrictSymLinks" or something similar).
