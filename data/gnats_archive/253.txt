>Description:
Yesterday, we killed our Apache via "kill -TERM". The server normaly
restarts via crontab after some minutes. This failed because Apache
could not bind to Port 80. "netstat -an" showed that this port
was in state BOUND. There were no other httpd processes running and no
zombies. Just a reboot could solve the problem.

Is this an Apache or Solaris problem ?

State-Changed-Why:
Almost certainly  a Solaris problem.  There are many known TCP
issues with 2.4; not sure if there are patches to make
2.4 work better or if you need to update to 2.5.
