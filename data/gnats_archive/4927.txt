>Description:
This problem already has been mentioned once:

If found it at a Date: Fri, 2 Oct 1998 13:12:42 -0400 in the
Bugs-database.
Even though there is a mention to the docs i can't get it to
work the way it should. Since i checked it multiple times and
some other folks on the internet tried to configure the same
stuff resulting in the same problem i guess there is either
a sw-bug or a serious config/doc-problem.

Following config:

Listen 62.104.246.100:80
Listen 62.104.246.100:2000

NameVirtualHost 62.104.246.100


<Virtualhost _default_:2000>
DocumentRoot e:/webspace/freepoint/slave/
php3_engine off
</Virtualhost>

<Virtualhost _default_:80>
DocumentRoot e:/webspace/freepoint/slave/
php3_engine off
</Virtualhost>

<Virtualhost _default_:*>
DocumentRoot e:/webspace/freepoint/slave/
php3_engine off
</Virtualhost>

<virtualhost 62.104.246.100>
port 80
DocumentRoot e:/webspace/freepoint/www/
servername www.freepoint.de
</virtualhost>

<VirtualHost 62.104.246.100:2000>
Port 2000
ServerAdmin ABlankerts@freepoint.de
DocumentRoot e:/construct/html
ServerName testcase.freepoint.de
</virtualhost>


I guess this is how it's described in the docs.
The _default_:2000 should catch a call to www.freepoint.de:2000
and answer with the /slave/-stuff.

But it doesn't. It uses what's defined for testcase.freepoint.de:2000

Why is that ?

I tried to change

NameVirtualHost 62.104.246.100

to

NameVirtualHost 62.104.246.100:80

and had the definition of each vhost have the :80..

No change in result.

Actually i'm lost and assume it's a bug.

MfG,
 Arne Blankerts




>How-To-Repeat:
either configure it on your own, or try my sites:

www.freepoint.de
testcase.freepoint.de:2000
www.freepoint.de:2000 <- the result here is WRONG
62.104.246.100 shows the page it SHOULD show..

no idea...

 After messing around for quite some more time i understand the "real" problem.
 Apache needs to listen on Port 2000 on the IP so it has to answer this port in general.
 
 That's whay every host on :2000 is answered.
 What i don't understand is why _default_:2000 does NOT catch it while the primary server is used.
 Anyway.. i configured the primary to a be the "catch-wrong"-server and it works.
 
 I guess you either have to fix the documentation what _default_:* and _default_:PORT is used for or
 change the behavior of apache in some way...
 
 Actually i have NO clue what _default_ is for since it doesn't work as expected.. 
 but that's another story i have to dig up..
