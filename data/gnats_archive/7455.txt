Linux 2.2.16 #22 i486 unknown (slackware 7.1)
>Description:
I don't know if this is a standard behavior of Apache, but even if it is so there seems to be a bug that interferes with mod.rewrite. If Apache cannot find the requested file name or directory it automatically looks for a matching file, and if it finds one, it returns the contents of that file even if its extension doesn't match. The problem is compounded with PHP files and rewrite rules (some of the rules are not executed if they conflict with this behavior). I included an actual example.
>How-To-Repeat:
There is a single file called a.php in http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/test/ . You can see it if you visit the above URL. If you enter http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/test/a (note that there is no extension) Apache should return an error, but it rather returns a.php (you should see 'Gotcha!'). It is even worse when you enter something like this http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/test/a/abc . It still works. This behavior ruins some of my rewrite rules. I didn't change anything in my configuration files. I was using 1.3.12 before, and everything was working fine. When I updated Apache to 1.3.19 I noticed the problem. For instance, the following rule doesn't work anymore if a.php exists (the rule is not even executed):

RewriteBase /homedir/aycan/test
RewriteRule ^a/id_([0-9]+)/$   a.php?id=$1
>Fix:
Unfortunately no.

 Try removing Option -> Multiviews from the directory in question, since that's
 the module that walks around the file extension.
