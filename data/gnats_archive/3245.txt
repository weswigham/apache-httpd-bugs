>Description:
The icons work fine when indexing all root documents, but none of the subdirs.

host/
host/~user
virtualhost/

all get indexed properly, the icons show up fine and the top line (Index of /) has the different font.

host/subdir
host/~user/subdir
virtualhost/subdir

don't get iconnized and the top line (Index of /subdir...) doesn't get the different font.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://host/ gets it right
http://host/subdir doesn't
>Fix:
I tried everything I could think of, read the docs, books and everything I could find, double checked all settings and posted questions on several mailing lists and newsgroups, but still no solution. And I'm about to upgrade to the latest but am not sure it'll get fixed...

State-Changed-Why:
First, it would have bene useful if you could have tried
upgrading _BEFORE_ submitting a bug report.  It just makes
life easier for everyone, we don't want to spend all our time
tracking down bugs that are fixed.

Can you provide a URL that shows what is happening?

Does anything show up in the error log?

Do you mean the images are broken or just don't show up?
If the latter, you probably have FancyIndexing disabled.
Check for any IndexOptions or FancyIndexing directives
either in your config file or your .htaccess file that may
disable fancyindexing.

 The upgrade is just a project and I'm not really counting on that right at the
 moment, I need what's there to run properly, this upgrade has already given me a
 lot of headaches, it's complex with adding mod_ssl/SSLeay plus mod_perl and a
 few others, the docs are too confusing... (sorry)

 Actually, I don't really know if it's a bug or not...

 Here's one:

 I have:
 
 Alias /icons/ /apache/icons/
 
 in the config and it works for anything at root document level, but nothing
 beyond that...

 They can't be broken, as they do show up for root document indexes, but they
 don't show up for subdirs...
 
 > If the latter, you probably have FancyIndexing disabled.
 
 Nope, I have:
 
 IndexOptions FancyIndexing
 
 and
 
 FancyIndexing on
 
 in the config as well.

 If it's in the config system wide, I shouldn't need to have a .htaccess everywhere..

 As we say before you submit a bug report, we can not support ancient
 versions of Apache and you should try a current version before thinking
 about submitting a bug report.

 We also ask you to include any messages from the error log.  Please have
 some respect.

 Yes, they are broken.  A "broken" image is a image that shows up with some
 type of "broken image" image beside it because the client can't find it.
 
 What AddIcon* directives and DefaultIcon directives do you have in your
 config files?

 No offense intended, I just didn't know to include any log entries in the form.

 Hmm.  I guess somehow:
 
 Looked at the error log. Please include any related messages in your
 report, or state that there are none.
 
 Isn't clear enough in the "before you report a bug page".

 Well, there is your problem!  You removed the leading '/' from all your
 icon configurations so of _course_ it is lookin in the subdirectory.
 Looked at the error log.

 Boy, I really can't remember doing this, I never realized it could be the
 problem, that fixed it, then it's no bug, thanks for the help :)
