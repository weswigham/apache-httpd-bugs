All operating systems. In my case:
Linux canary.computel.nl 2.0.34 #1 Fri May 8 16:05:57 EDT 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
We have a few CGI's that can be used by all virtual hosts. The most important 
one (for us) is PHP. But we want the CGI to run with suExec.

The only option (as far as I can see) is to have a CGI for every virtual
host, owned by the user of that virtual host. With a lot of virtual hosts this 
uses a LOT of diskspace, and it is a lot of work to update a CGI.
>How-To-Repeat:
See the description.
>Fix:
Allow files owned by a certain user, in a directory owned bij that user,
to be executed by suExec, so you can make a special directory with CGI's that
everyone can use. I used the user apache runs as. I made the following
patch to support this:
