The kernel slightly modified by me. Mainly a bugfix in a NIC driver.
>Description:
My plan is to rewrite http://www.mysite.com/a/A123456789/c?d to 
http://A123456789.someothersite.com/c?d and to proxy that through a proxy on 
my localhost.

(A123456789 can actually be just an a (upper or lowercase) followed by 9 numbers.)

I tried to accomplish this by doing the following:

ProxyPass Off
RewriteRule ^/a/([a|A][0-9]{9})/(.*)$ http://$1.someothersite.com/$2?%{QUERY_STRING} [P]
ProxyRemote * http://localhost:8888/

However, it does not work too well. This is the rewrite log:

rewrite /a/A123456789/c -> http://A123456789.someothersite.com/c?d
split uri=http://A123456789.someothersite.com/c?d -> uri=http://A123456789.someothersite.com/c, args=d
forcing proxy-throughput with http://A123456789.someothersite.com/c
go-ahead with proxy request proxy:http://A123456789.someothersite.com/c [OK]

So, the QUERY_STRING is lost on the way.

Obvious by the description.

I have no suggestions how to fix this.

 This bug does not exist. However, the report shows another problem.
 
 The http request that ProxyRemote *does not* leave out the
 QUERY_STRING. It is there. It just doesn't show up in the mod_rewrite log. 
 
 This is rather confusing. Why not let me see the entire string that is
 beeing proxied?
