>Description:
When compiling apache, in modules/ssl/, make fails with:

ssl_engine_rand.c: In function `ssl_rand_seed':
ssl_engine_rand.c:154: `ap_scoreboard_image' undeclared (first use in this function)
ssl_engine_rand.c:154: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ssl_engine_rand.c:154: for each function it appears in.)
ssl_engine_rand.c:155: `SCOREBOARD_SIZE' undeclared (first use in this function)
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 --with-mpm=perchild --enable-mods-shared=all --enable-ssl --enable-suexec --with-suexec-caller=apache --with-suexec-userdir=public_html --with-suexec-docroot=/var/www/html

make
>Fix:
I added:
#include "scoreboard.h"
to the list of "Apache headers" in modules/ssl/mod_ssl.h, and that seems to have fixed it.
>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Thu Jan  3 06:02:22 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
ssl_engine_rand has been changed such that it no longer references ap_scoreboard_image or SCOREBOARD_SIZE (though
some of that old code is there but commented out while a
cleaner solution to entropy is discussed).

A build of current code from CVS, or the next tarball (2.0.30?), will no longer have the problem.

Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache!
