SunOS redrum 5.5.1 Generic_103640-06 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20
>Description:
Connecting via mod_proxy to an URL which is valid but for which the server is
tempoaraily unavailable, the error report incorrectly indicates an internal
error in the proxy server. However, it also reports the correct reason.

Also, when a DNS lookup times out, the same error is raised even though the
cause is a network bottleneck.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a server as a proxy. Connect to another server via a valid URL. Disable
the target server. Repeat the test.
>Fix:
This is my naive suggestion.

In mod_proxy, proxy_util.c 
change line 843 ("return HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR")
to "return HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE"

 I have some additional information re #3455 which may be useful. I have
 found the following work-around is effective. It may form the basis for
 a full solution, I don't know.
 
 In main/http_protocol.c change lines 2365 onwards from
 
         case HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE:
         ap_bputs("The server is temporarily unable to service your\n"
                      "request due to maintenance downtime or capacity\n"
 
                      "problems. Please try again later.\n", fd);
             break;
 
 to
 
         case HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE:
         ap_bvputs(fd, "The server is temporarily unable to service
 your\n"
                      "request due to maintenance downtime or capacity\n"
 
                      "problems. Please try again later.\n<P>\n"
                      "If the problem persists, "
                  "please contact the server administrator,\n ",
                      ap_escape_html(r->pool, r->server->server_admin),
                      " for assistance.<P>\n", NULL);
             if ((error_notes = ap_table_get(r->notes, "error-notes")) !=
 NULL) {
                 ap_bvputs(fd, error_notes, "<P>\n", NULL);
             }
             break;
 
 
 This is in addition to the other change. In mod_proxy, proxy_util.c
 change line 843 ("return HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR")
 to "return HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE"

State-Changed-When: Tue Feb 16 06:20:16 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Based in part on your patch, two changes in http_protocol.c
and proxy_util.c address this problem.
First, the proxy doesn't always return HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
any longer, and second, the proxy sets an "expose" flag
so that the error printing routine displays the error-notes
text. Thanks for your patch/suggestion.
