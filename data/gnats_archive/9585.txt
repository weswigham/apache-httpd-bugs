Linux Mandrake 7.2 with kernel 2.4.16 (Athlon)

>Description:
Every script taking a long time to be executed can be dangerous when 
executing "apachectl graceful", because if a "graceful restart" has occured 
between the time when you begin to load the page and the time when you hit 
the stop button (or reload the script), the process won't die, and will
continue infinitely, and if you reload, the new process will be "immortal"
as well, as will be all the next ones !!!

If I comment "User" and "Group" in my Virtual Host configuration, and changes 
to permissions of the script to 755, stop Apache, start Apache, call my 
script and then restart gracefully apache, the process becomes  <defunct> 
just after I hit the stop button, and then die. So everything is OK without 
SuExec.

So if Apache allows 100 childs, just type 100 times <Enter> in the URL bar 
after loading the script a first time and after a graceful restart, and you 
can trust all the childs until the system administrator kills them manually. 
During this time, Apache won't be able to respond to other visitors any more. 
This need only a very few resources on the remote attacker and on the network 
(9600bits/s can be enough...).

This can even prevent Apache from restarting. I even had to reboot my web server.

I send it to security@apache.org, since this can be used for a DoS attack.
But no answer for 2 days....
>How-To-Repeat:
use this script with suexec, run it, then restart apache gracefully, then reload the script several times, and type "top" !

#!/usr/bin/perl
printf "Content-type: text/html\n\n<html><body>";
for ($i=1;$i<=4000;$i++)
{print "$i\n<br>";sleep(1);
}
>Fix:
Just kill the "suexeced" cgi-scripts when using "apachectl graceful", like are the other CGIs.
