Linux 3.0.32 / gcc v2.7.2.3 / no patches to apache
>Description:
this bug (if it's a bug) affects logging (and possible tracking & statistics)
for systems running v1.2.6 on a machine with one ip, but several hostnames..

i recently upgraded from apache v1.2.5 to v1.2.6.. the machine it runs on has
one ip and about four different hostnames.. i have apache configured to
maintain different logfiles (requests and errors) for each of the hostnames
via <VirtualHost> blocks in httpd.conf.. everything was working fine (since
v1.2.4) until i upgraded to v1.2.6.. the first time it happened, i just
restarted v1.2.6 and everything was fine, but by morning it was back to
logging ALL requests and errors to the primary access.log and errors.log files..

now, of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the requests were coming from
old browsers such as mosaic, old netscape, or old lynx, but this is happening
regardless of what browser the user is using:

Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.0; AOL 3.0; Windows 3.1)
Mozilla/4.04 [en] (Win95; I)
Mozilla/3.01C-SI304A01 (Win16; I)
Mozilla/3.04Gold (Win15; I)
Mozilla/4.05 [en] (Win95; I)
Mozilla/3.01 (Macintosh; I; PPC)

etc.. etc..
>How-To-Repeat:
uhm.. beats me.. ;)
best i could do is email someone a copy of my config files..

i only see one way to reproduce the error, setup a machine with one ip, assign
it some hostnames, and configure apache with <VirtualHost> blocks & see what
happens..

<VirtualHost vhost1.blah.org>
DocumentRoot /home/vhost1
ServerName vhost1.blah.org
ErrorLog logs/vhost1.error.log
TransferLog logs/vhost1.access.log
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost>
DocumentRoot /home/vhost2
ServerName vhost2.lala.net
ErrorLog logs/vhost2.error.log
TransferLog logs/vhost2.access.log
</VirtualHost>

that's basically what my setup is like..

 There are a few other reports like this in the bugdb.
 
 The most likely cause is that you have entries in /etc/hosts (or NIS) 
 which do not match the DNS addresses for the affected hosts.
 
 Try logging into your webserver and typing "telnet hostname" for one of
 the affected hosts and see what IP address it goes to.
