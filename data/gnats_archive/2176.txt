>Environment:
i386-sun-solaris2.6
Solaris x86 2.6
gcc 2.4.5
apache source code 1.2.6
>Description:
Complie will end with a FATAL ERROR #1 in alloc.o.  Running make with verbose output showed that the error was in a header file called stat.h.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I was able to "fix" this by renaming the stat.h file in /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i386-sun-solaris2.6/2.4.5/include/sys directory of gcc and then replacing it with stat.h from /usr/include/sys. As far as I can tell this second file is part of the Solaris distribution.  After this the complie finished with no warnings or errors and seems to fucntion with no problems.

State-Changed-Why:
That's almost certainly a problem with your gcc installation.
When gcc is built it does special things with the system header
files.  If you get a mismatch between a gcc built on a system with
different header files it'll easily mess things up.  I suggest
you rebuild gcc...

Take care
