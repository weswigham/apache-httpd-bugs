>Description:
ScriptLog directives in httpd.conf within Virtual hosts area
and outside of Virtual hosts area don't take affect. I would think
that restarting the server would at least create the files a specify, but
it doesn't.

Example of usage:
ScriptLog logs/script.log

I also tried putting it in srm.conf. No luck.

State-Changed-Why:
This file will only be created when (if) a script causesan error response. It will not be created by just restarting theserver. Also if the user that runs the httpd child processesdoes not have write permission to the directory or file namesd,the logging may not work. Make sure the file given iswritable by the httpd user (a file in /tmp might be a goodlocation).If it still does not work, please send your configuration filesand the output from error_log when accessing a bad script.
