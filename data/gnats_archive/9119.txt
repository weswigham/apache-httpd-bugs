>Environment:
XP 5.1.2600.0
>Description:
Simply won't display a handful of .JPG files for no apparent reason.  The files are present in the htdocs dir, I can access them locally either with Windows explorer or navigating the files with IE 6 on the local drive.  I have no explanation.  The images were generated at the same time and with the same software as all the others, but for some reason... thy won't show up.

I am running behind a firewall (router) on a cable connection using port 90.
