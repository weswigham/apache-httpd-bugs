AIX 4.2.5 
uname yields  "AIX teddy 2 4 000061174600"
compiler =gcc
gcc -v yields "Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/rs6000-ibm-aix4.1.4.0/2.7.2.2/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.2"

>Description:
output from make command follows.  
I was able to compile in AIX 3.2.5 using earlier version of gcc.  
So Configuration files are not the problem

Here is tht output from make in 4.2.5:

Target "all" is up to date.
Target "lib" is up to date.

State-Changed-Why:
As your output clearly shows, you are using AIX 4.2.5
with a 4.1.4 compiler.  You need a version of gcc designed
for your version of your OS.
