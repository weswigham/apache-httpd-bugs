>Description:
Apache fails to install correctly as an NT service.  I believe the reason for this is that the path provided in the registry is incorrect:

My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Apache\ImagePath = "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\Apache.exe"

This value is incorrect, because I installed apache to another drive (G:), but the service was installed pointing to the wrong location.
>How-To-Repeat:
To repeat the problem, install Apache onto another drive, and then try to install it as an NT service.  An NT service entry will appear, but it will not run.
>Fix:
I worked around the problem by fixing the path in the registry:
My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Apache\ImagePath should point to the proper path selected at install time.

State-Changed-Why:
How did you install the Apache service, via command line or by
clicking on program menu item?
Did you install Apache twice, first to the C: drive and then to 
the G: drive?
Does clicking "Uninstall Apache Service" program item followed
by "Install Apache as Service" fix the problem?
Can you recreate the problem?

 1.	I installed the Apache service by selecting "Install Apache as Service
 (NT Only)" in the Start Menu.
 2.	I had installed a previous version of Apache a long time ago, but I had
 uninstalled it (so I thought).  I don't remember in which directory I had
 installed it, but it was probably C:.
 3.	I did not try to uninstall and reinstall the service, because I hacked it
 into working by editing the registry.  However, now that it works, when I do
 uninstall and reinstall the service, it works properly.
 4.	Now that my Apache server is up and running, I'm afraid I can't take it
 down and try to recreate the problem.  Sorry.

I believe the problem reported was due to there being an entry
in the registry from a previous installation and that installing
Apache as a service with the current installation would have 
fixed the problem.

 In that case, since I did do a complete uninstall of my previous Apache
 installation but the registry key was still there, there may be a problem
 with the uninstaller not cleaning out the registry completely.
