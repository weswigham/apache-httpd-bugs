>Description:
With the "Option Indexes" turned off (not specified) in access.conf regular 
directories are not viewable, as intended.  However, with the "Options Indexes" 
turned off directories that are Aliased (set up using "Alias" in srm.conf) 
are still viewable.  Definitely seems like a security issue to me, I don't 
want my users to be able to view that directory.
