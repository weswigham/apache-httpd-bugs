>Description:
We are using apache as proxy server for HTML on our Firewall with no problems.
However using the FTP protocol through the apache server seems imposible.
When I try to download a file from a ftp server via Netscape the ftp file
is displayed in HTML document window. Netscape is configured to use for FTP the
same proxy address (5000) as for HTML.
I tried several configuration options alike Addtype, and modified the
mime.types file buth with no success.
What is neccesary to use apache as FTp proxy server ?

You need to add entries for your mimie.types file for the
files you're having this effect with. See the proxy FAQ on
the mod_proxy docs page.
