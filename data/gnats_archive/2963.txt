>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.2.6, JDK1.1.6, JSDK 2.0, JServ 1.0beta snapshot 980906
>Description:
If you have an initArgs line like this, with several initial arguments 
separated by commas AND white spaces:

xxx.xxx.initArgs=name1=value1, name2=value2,  name3=value3

When you later do a "getInitParameter" for "name2" or "name3" you won't get it,
because it has the parameters mapped with names " name2" and "  name3".

State-Changed-Why:

This is fixed in the latest version of JServSSI.  You can
get this with the latest snapshot of the JServ source tree
(the 0.9.x tree is no longer in development); the snapshots
are available from http://java.working-dogs.com/daily/

This bug will be marked closed when a checkpointed version
of the 1.0b development tree is released, unless we hear
that this is still a problem.
