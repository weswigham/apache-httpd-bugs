[Wed Jun 27 15:27:58 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] (2)No such file or directory: script not
found or unable to stat: c:/program file/apache group/apache/koha/cgi-bin/koha/search.pl

That directory does have search.pl. but it says it doesn't. I also changed the shebang line of
search.pl and it still gives me the same error.

Can u please help me.?
>How-To-Repeat:
Just goto koha.org and download that stuff. Then get mysql and follow the koha configuration. then it will give you the error.

Nope

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
