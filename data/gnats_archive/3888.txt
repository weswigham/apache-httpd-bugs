Result of uname -a: UnixWare eurodic 5 7 i386 x86at SCO UNIX_SVR5 
>Description:
During heavy loads (1 request every 10 seconds), the system seems to 'hang' due
to too many connections in time_wait. The system is actually in test phase and the 
system load has to be increased in final phase up to 1 request every second.

Is there a way to force the time_wait timer to reduce to very low value?
