>Environment:
I downloaded and installed Apache 1.3.6 hoping that it would be used mainly as a cache server for my firewall. I have a NT4 server SP3. My firewall runs on unix and sends authentication request to all connecting clients(nt4 ws).
>Description:
In the httpd.conf, I only added the following lines and changed this :

I also unmarked all the modules

ProxyRequest On
ProxyRemote * http://firewall.mycompany.com:80
NoProxy .mycompany.com

All cache values to run as per default. 

Error message from the error.log :
[Fri Jul 30 12:01:52 1999] [warn] proxy: Bad HTTP/1.0 header returned by http://www.yahoo.com/ (GET)
