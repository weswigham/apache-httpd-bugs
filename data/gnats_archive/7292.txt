Window NT 4.0 SP 5 (english)
>Description:
Trying to install Apache 1.3.17 on the above mentioned system, the installer throws an "Internal Error 2735. ResolveServerName" and cancels installing.

I also installed it on another machine (with the same configuration) without problems. Seems to be a combined problem of Apache installer and NT.
>How-To-Repeat:
On the above mentioned system, it never worked. On the other it worked without a problem.
>Fix:
Try to localize the internal error and give a hint, what's "wrong" on the NT-System.

State-Changed-Why:

This bug has been reported before.  Search the bugs database
for a more detailed answer.

Some aspect of Win32 IP Networking is not installed on this
system, the WinSock2 update is not installed, or their is
cripleware (such as a not-fully implemented provider such
as Aventail connect) installed for TCP/IP networking.

The next release of Apache will provide a slightly more
meaningful message than 2735.

Thanks for your interest in the Apache httpd project.
