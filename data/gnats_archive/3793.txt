>Description:
While this is not a bug, per se, I think it is still woth mentioning.  We upgraded our old Apache 1.2 server to 1.3.2 
several months ago.  It was a big problem for us that the default paths had changed.  These paths, of course
can be changed in the configuration files, but we wanted to try to keep up with the changes.  After some messing
around, we finally got all of the paths changed.  Life was happy.  I upgraded to 1.3.3 when it was release.  More
happiness.  I saw that 1.3.4 was released and I was eccstatic!  Little did I know that the default paths had changed
AGAIN!  Now, in order to stay with the default paths, I must go through and change all sorts of paths
in various CGI's, log analyzers, etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Upgrade from Apache 1.2 to 1.3.3 then to 1.3.4
>Fix:
The old paths or the new, I don't care, but the constant changing is really an issue for some 
of us anal-retentive administrators who don't want to stray from the norm.  Ad my
dear grandfather says "S**t or get off the pot" meaning, pick one or pick the other, just pick!

State-Changed-Why:
We are quite aware of the changing paths and the unfortunate
issues associated with them.  This is documented, and there really
isn't anything we can do about this at this point.
