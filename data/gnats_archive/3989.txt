>Description:

I've got several vhosts on my server, but they are not located
under the main server's docroot tree, so they won't initially work
with suexec.

I only use ScriptAliases - This way I am able to control the use 
of CGI by a restricted set of users, and they name their cgi as they want.

I would like suexec to work with ScriptAliased directories.

[workaround - I disabled the htdocs path checking of suexec, that's
still safe enough for my site]
>How-To-Repeat:

Have ScriptAlias directories outside htdocs.
>Fix:

Makes suexec more complicated: if script path not in docroot, load
an alternate list of trusted ScriptAliased directories from a safe file.

As most sites does not need this, provide it as a makefile option.

Provide an utility to compile such a list from httpd.conf and eventually
accessible .htaccess files.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan  7 14:57:37 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:

The current design of suexec requires that all suexeced
scripts reside under the path defined at compile-time.
That may mean that you need to define that as "/",
but that's the way it works.  Any and all options must
be set at compile-time, not run-time.

 "It's not a bug it's a feature", so ? :) How should I report a suexec
 _design_ bug ?

 This is not really convenient when using pre-compiled binaries. For
 example everytime I upgrade my system my own version of suexec gets
 overwritten ... and having to set the path as "/" means that this is a
 sometimes useless security check.
 
 I think that using a pre-parsed run-time config file won't hurt the
 performance too much and will really ease suexec's configuration ... and
 it's as safe as suexec alone.
