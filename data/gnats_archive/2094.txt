Linux pinguin 2.0.33 #17 Thu Mar 26 17:42:57 CET 1998 i686 unknown
>Description:
In the following case, caching of an otherwise cachable document no longer 
occurs:

mod_proxy receives a proxy request for a remote document
there is a copy found in the cache, but it is expired
the document is refetched from the origin server, and the content length 
  has changed

In the case described above, the new version of the document is not cached but
rather the old version is kept. With the next proxy request for the same 
document, the origin server is contacted again, and so on.

In ap_proxy_cache_tidy, below the commentary 
/* file lengths don't match; don't cache it */
bc is not equal c->len and proxy_cache_tidy immediately returns without caching
the new version.

The problem is the line 
  clen = ap_proxy_get_header(c->hdrs, "Content-Length");
in ap_proxy_cache_update, where the old rather than the new content length is 
taken. Here c->hdrs should be replaced by resp_hdrs in order to get the right
value for c->len *and* for buff which is written to the cache-file.

(I also considered the problem being in ap_proxy_cache_tidy, 
but without the fix in proxy_cache_update the wrong value also gets 
into the cache file via buff.)

I'm going to have another look at proxy_cache.c, but
it looks like your patch fixes the bug. Thank you!

State-Changed-Why:
Yes. The calculation of the length was definitely wrong.
I put your proposed fix into the 1.3b7 release.
Thanks a lot for your help.
