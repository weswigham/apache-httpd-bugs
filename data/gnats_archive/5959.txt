>Description:
When using a statement like

HeaderName HEADER

in the config file, and two file are present in the directory in question, like

HEADER   HEADER.html

then HEADER is being displayed instead of HEADER.html as the documentation in 
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_autoindex.html#headername
would suggest.

State-Changed-When: Tue Aug  7 07:22:41 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

This is correct behavior.  An exact filename match always
wins.  Given HEADER.txt and HEADER.html, then HEADER.html
should win.
