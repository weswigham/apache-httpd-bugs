Do not depend on machine environment.
However, environment of this place is SunOS 5.6 Generic_105181-22 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-250.
>Description:
It is assumed that there was the following environment.

              |
              |  (waiting port/80)
    [Port forwarding device] (ex. BIG/ip)
              |
              |  (connecting port/2000)
    [Web Server waiting port 2000]

When I access 'test' directory of DocumentRoot subordinates as 
http://www.domain/test then Server answers it as follows.

% telnet localhost 80
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET http://www.domain/test HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 15 Dec 2000 10:55:52 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)
Location: http://www.domain:2000/test/
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>301 Moved Permanently</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Moved Permanently</H1>
The document has moved <A HREF="http://www.domain:2000/test/">here</A>.<P>
</BODY></HTML>
Connection closed by foreign host.

Because server adds the port number that oneself works and turns over 
"Moved Permanently" when I do port forwarding, error occurs.

>How-To-Repeat:
Please prepare the environment that can access server by a change 
of access port. And access not to add "/" to one directory last.
>Fix:
Add directive to appoint the port number that I want to indicate as
"Moved Permanently" to "httpd.conf".

For example, I add attachment of "ForwardPort 80" in "httpd.conf"
if I add directive of ForwardPort.

The following is patch of that purpose.
#Will it be a right solution method?

 Does it work if you configure as follows?
 
 	Listen 2000
 	Port 80

 Perhaps it will be YES.
 However, because separate httpd moves in "Port 80" already,
 it cannot.

State-Changed-Why:

You misunderstood Tony.  Check the docs on Port, and
you will see that when a Listen directive is specified,
Port DOES NOT set the actual port that Apache listens
to.  It only sets the port used in redirects, etc.
Tony's suggested configuration should work perfectly
in your situation.

 Yes, I found it. I misunderstood that "Port" did bind the
 port, actually.

 I was able to confirm it.
 Thanks a lot!!
