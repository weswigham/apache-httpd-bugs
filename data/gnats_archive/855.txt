>Description:

I just wanted to recommend a directive that would make the authentication 
non-case sensitive.  I needed this for our server so I manually when in to
the mod_auth.c and added the code, but I know of many people who would also
like it non-case sensitive.

Thanks

n/a
>Fix:
Add a directive for non-case sensitivity.

State-Changed-Why:
Just about every password system in real life is password-
sensitive; we're hesitant to give people more ways to reduce
the security of their systems.  Thanks for the suggestion.

oops, "password-sensitive" should have said "case-sensitive".
