Not much more info I can provide. Ran the installer and attempted to start. Everything loaded into default directories, config files default, etc.

Try installing it on a windowd 98 machine. I have MS Personal Web Server too, but it was off the entire time.

 Please send the contents of your *.conf files.

 The config files are edited by the installer.  You can't just copy the
 *.dist-win files and have them work, you have to either edit them or use
 the installer.  I need to see what config files the installer generated.

 You have:
 
 DocumentRoot "C:Bulk/Web Sites/Crinos"
 
 That was not created by the installer.  It is also not a valid 
 path; it has to be "C:/Bulk/Web Sites/Crinos".

 I forgot that I modified the srm.conf too. Additionally, I'm an idiot. I
 changed the path names so they were correct and the server fired right up.
 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go shoot myself. Sorry to have wasted
 your time. Chalk it up to a UNIX Apache user too stupid to make the
 transition to Win32.... :(

 Hi.
 
 I received this error (running from the DOS 7 command line
 (Win95 on a Pentium)):
 
 == con: ================================
 F:\ApacheGroup\Apache>F:\ApacheGroup\Apache\Apache.exe -d F:\APACHE~1\APACHE
 [Thu Jul 30 23:52:54 1998] file .\os\win32\util_win32.c, line 66, assertion 
 "s>= szFile && "this is a known bug"" failed
 
 F:\ApacheGroup\Apache>_
 == /con: ===============================
 
 I've just installed the binary win32 files (1.3.1), did just a bit 
 of editing in the conf/*.conf files (made a copy from the .tmp/
 *.conf-dist-win files), and made a sample index.html file in
 the right directory. But running the shortlink created by the
 install program gave me only a quickly-disappearing DOS-window.
 Luckily for me, I know how to write a simple batch file, where
 I could easily add a PAUSE statement ;) I then saw the above
 message.
 Looking at <http://bugs.apache.org> I saw you had solved
 the problem (PR number 2684). Jippy! Or is it?
 
 I searched all my files for this kind of solution, but to no avail.
 I then took the liberty to #comment all commands from the three
 conf/*.conf files until the error disappeared, thus pinpointing
 the cause to access.conf (after uncommenting the others back)!
 I have three entries there, two Directory directives and one
 Location directive:
 
 == access.conf =========================
 <Directory "@@ServerRoot@@/htdocs">
 Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
 AllowOverride None
 order allow,deny
 allow from all
 </Directory>
 
 <Directory "@@ServerRoot@@/cgi-bin">
 AllowOverride None
 Options None
 </Directory>
 
 <Location /cgi-bin/phf*>
 deny from all
 ErrorDocument 403 http://phf.apache.org/phf_abuse_log.cgi
 </Location>
 == /access.conf ========================
 
 All directories mentioned are available on my PC, except
 /cgi-bin itself. But the strange part is, that the
 location directive is not the problem! Both the Directory 
 directives are! Either one alone, or both together...
 The true problem that could be there would then be in the 
 @@ServerRoot@@, but checking httpd.conf told me:
 
 == httpd.conf ==========================
 #ServerRoot: The directory the server's config, error, and log files
 #are kept in
 #ServerRoot "@@ServerRoot@@"
 ServerRoot "F:/APACHE~1/APACHE"
 == /httpd.conf =========================
 
 which was confirmed as the -d parameter on the commandline...
 (which gave the error even if I used the / instead of the \...)
 
 With both Directory entries disabled, my Apache WebServer is 
 up and running smooth as a baby skin...
 
 I hope this helps clearing the problem...
 
 
 Kind regards,

 Your problem is that you have to replace the @@ServerRoot@@ with the
 actual directory you are using.
 
 The installer does that automatically when it creates the *.conf files.

 Hi, Marc,
 
 Thanks for the (very fast!) reply!
 
 You wrote:

 I thought the program would do that 'run-time'???
 Do I have to manually change all @@Variables@@ this way, or
 only in the address.conf?
 Maybe this can be made a bit more clear in the docs?
 
 > The installer does that automatically when it creates the *.conf files.
 
 Mmmm, my conf/ directory was empty at first, and the files
 in the .tmp/ directory (where I copied the *.conf-distr-win files)
 were not automatically correct...

 Thanks for your help, I appreciate it very much.
