FreeBSD-3.3-RELEASE, apache-1.3.9
>Description:
In the operating system I use (FreeBSD), there is possibility to
restrict user programs from consuming too much cpu time.
It can be accomplished by setting 'cputime' variable in
/etc/login.conf.  But if suexec runs program as a particular
user, this program can consume unlimited cpu resources, regardless
what is written in /etc/login.conf
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
get current settings from login.conf and call setrlimit just
after suexec starts.
