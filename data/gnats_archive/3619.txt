>Description:
My apache-server has worked fine. But now, I've installed X and from this time, the server doesn't start. httpd always claims, that there are failures in the config files. I must comment many lines in these files, even AddType and AddHandler. When the server is active, nothing works the right way, because it doesn't serve the right data.

What's going wrong?

State-Changed-Why:
You have to give a more precise description of what you did
and exactly what errors you are getting.

Did you install Apache using some package system or did you
install it yourself from the base distribution?

It really sounds like something broken with your OS or a
modified version of Apache that comes with your OS, and we
really can't do anything about that...
