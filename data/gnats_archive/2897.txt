hi there,

i'm using apache 1.2.6 over a linux slackware v 2.0.3 box,
my web server is running as normal user and group so i need to read my
/etc/shadow file owned by root to authenticate users via web page running a
cgi script, so i'm tring to use suexec and i guess everything is setup
correctly.

NB : when i run the httpd server the follwing message appear :
"Configuring Apache for use with Suexec wrapper"
my cgi.log's always empty


my problem is : i still don't have access to this file !

Any thoughts, and hopefully suggestions as to how to handle this will be
greatly appreciated.
regards
