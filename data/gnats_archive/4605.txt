>Description:
Hello

When configuring virtual host to run under a different user than the default apache
user (here is the virtual hgost config)
<VirtualHost www.cs.ait.ac.th:80>
SSLDisable
DocumentRoot    /home/www.cs.ait.ac.th/htdocs
ServerName      www.cs.ait.ac.th
# I cannot use csim here, I dunno why, if use csim, I cannot use
# <!--#set SSI directive
User            httpd
ServerAdmin     on@cs.ait.ac.th
TransferLog     /home/www.cs.ait.ac.th/logs/transfer_log
ErrorLog        /home/www.cs.ait.ac.th/logs/error_log
ScriptAlias     /cgi-bin        /home/www.cs.ait.ac.th/cgi-bin
Redirect        /~wutt          http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/wutt
Redirect        /smartnet99             http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~ca/smartnet99
ScriptAlias     /Harvest/cgi-bin/       /home/www.cs.ait.ac.th/htdocs/Harvest/cg
i-bin/
Alias           /Harvest/       /home/www.cs.ait.ac.th/htdocs/Harvest/
<Directory /home/www.cs.ait.ac.th/htdocs/CSIM-limited>
AddHandler CSIM-limited html
AddHandler CSIM-limited shtml
Action CSIM-limited /cgi-bin/CSIM-limited
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>                                                  

User httpd is the default apache user, I want to use a specific user for that virtual\
host, with the directive User csim

When I do that, every thing goes fine except that the <!--#set XSSI directives
are not passed to the <!--#exec'ed CGI (i.e. I don't get new environment variables set
with what information I would like to set).

I presume this is a restriction due to suexec that limit the environment
variables passed to the process after it has done a setuid.

I do need suexec, I do need to run the different virtual hosts under different 
users names and I would really like to use <!--#set directive

Thank you
>How-To-Repeat:
On a server with suexec and virtual hosts, set a virtual host to run under a
user different from the default apache user

User a web page like

<!--#set var="foo" value="bar" -->
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/test" -->

test CGI doing nothing more than printing the list of environment variables, I
could not see the variable foo with the value bar

State-Changed-Why:

You are correct, suexec has a severely limited number of
environment variables that it will pass on to the
exec'd script.  Arbitrary envariables set by SSI directives
are not among them.  However, you *can* use different
User/Group values on a per-vhost basis; that's supported.
Please upgrade to 1.3.9 and try that aspect again.  If
you want the arbitrary envariables, you're going to need
to alter the suexec source yourself.  Thanks for using
Apache!
