[Thu Jun  5 11:49:22 1997] access to /home/httpd/html/frontpage.cgi.html failed for jato.hackvan.com, reason: file permissions deny server execution

Try to access a plain file named foo.cgi.html and see if it's correctly 
recognized as text/html instead of executed as a CGI.
>Fix:
When matching filename extensions, search from rindex(filename, '.') instead of
searching the whole string.

I can not replicate this problem with 1.2.0.  1.2b7 is quite

 I've since upgraded to 1.2.0 and the problem is still there...
 
     ==> error_log <==
     [Wed Jun 11 16:45:44 1997] access to /home/httpd/html/frontpage.cgi.html failed for localhost, reason: file permissions deny server execution
 
 I'm running with "Options ExecCGI" and srm.comf contains
 
     # To use CGI scripts:
     AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
 
 
 ----------------
 
 In other news, it seems that the comment at the bottom of the default
 srm.conf is incorrect.  301 would be the correct status code for redirection
 "301 Moved Permanently".

 PS:  Roy Fielding's ABOUT_APACHE file is wonderfully written.  I really like
 the description of how the apache group works and his description of why
 apache is free.  (Of course I don't suppose this has much place in your bug
 database. ;)

State-Changed-Why:
Looking at this further, this is not an incorrect behavior,
just unexpected.  The code is explicitly designed to allow
that, to allow users to setup things such as foo.ssi.html.

Changing the AddHandler to an AddType would eliminate the
problem in this case, as would changing it to:

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi$

 An old one which wasn't forwarded to apbugs.  Marc, your .cgi$ suggestion
 is bogus. That disables CGIs unless they're named .cgi$.  This is still a
 somewhat open problem, and related to the more recent PR asking for
 "SetHandler none".

 In this case, then the default configuration of the web server is, I think,
 erroneous.  Below is a patch to fix the default configuration for CGI
 scripts, but I think that some consideration should also be given to the use
 of AddHandler vs AddType throughout the default configuration file...
