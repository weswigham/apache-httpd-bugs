Solaris.
>Description:
Only our server www.cc.mydomain.com is accessible from outside thru the firewall. It is also used to access the outside world thru a proxy. When we map a local machine into its address space to make it accessible from outside, it asks the users for authentication which it should not? why should it use proxy service to access a local page? It works if proxy authentication is turned off.

ProxyRequests On
ProxyRemote * http://proxy.mydomain.com:8000/
ProxyDomain   .cc.mydomain.com
ProxyPass /foo/ http://foo.cc.mydomain.com/

<Directory proxy:*>
AuthType Basic
AuthName ProxyService
AuthUserFile /pkgs/apache/etc/passwd
require valid-user
</Directory>

>How-To-Repeat:
as mentioned above.
>Fix:

I tried NoProxy for the local machine, but it did not work.
