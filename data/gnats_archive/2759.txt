php 3 final release

When the UA close an loading connection (Stop button or crash ) ,
the php process launched by Apache never stops.
I've heard it isnt a php specific problem, but affect also other CGI programs. i didn't verified it though.
the php process :
- stays in memory "forever"
- can't be killed ( permission denied in task manager)
- seems to be in a "stopped state" ( uses no cpu time)
- stay even after apache service being restarted
- the only way to get rid of it is to restart the machine.
