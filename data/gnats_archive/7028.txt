A simple win95 PC station.

Installation ok, no problem.
When I run apache.exe, the Command window quickly disappear and I get the following information in .../logs/error.log :
[Thu Jan 04 14:16:56 2001] [crit] (10091)(FormatMessage failed with code 317): setup_inherited_listeners: WSASocket failed to open the inherited socket.
>How-To-Repeat:
No way...  :(
...Unless I send you out my PC...
>Fix:
Yes, give me the name of the .dll that is not up to date to this release or specify the win95 versions that are supposed to be able to run Apache 1.3.14.
The problem seems to occur in the socks2 module, but I've just replaced it by the one provided by microsoft (not a garantee, but...)

One more thought, are you running VPN software whatsoever,
such as Aventail connect?  Please see the FAQ on possible
problems that could cause.

Finally, please detail the Time, Date and DLL Versions
for the following windows\system files:

wsock32.dll
ws2help.dll
ws2_32.dll
