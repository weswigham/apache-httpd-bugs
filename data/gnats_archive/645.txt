- State-Changed-Why:
- I have a strong suspicion that the problem you are seeing
- may be due to the fact that Apache 1.2 responds with HTTP/1.1
- headers.  Your report indicates you're getting HTTP/1.0
- responses, but it also looks like it was typed from memory
- rather than being an actual transcript.
- 
- Can you bring the 1.2 server back up, perhaps on a different
- port, and let us know the URL?  That will let us do a little
- testing.
Maybe next week, I send you a mail!
