>Description:
It's pretty much of the problem in breif description. Problem is caused
by the fact mod_dir returns NOT_IMPLEMENTED if method isn't M_GET. This
makes it impossible to implement PUT method for a directory:-(
>How-To-Repeat:
in .htaccess
Script PUT /cgi-bin/PUT
<Limit PUT>
allow from all
</Limit>
>Fix:
*** mod_dir.c.orig      Fri Jun 27 04:21:22 1997
--- mod_dir.c   Fri Sep  5 16:05:55 1997

*** 872,878 ****
      if (error_notfound)
        return error_notfound;
  
!     if (r->method_number != M_GET) return NOT_IMPLEMENTED;
      
      /* OK, nothing easy.  Trot out the heavy artillery... */

 Oh BTW, it should be possible to implement PUT ... you just have to put
 your module after mod_dir in Configuration.  Then it has the chance to
 deal with PUT first.
