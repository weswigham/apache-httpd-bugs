HP-UX hp9k A.08.00 D 9000/832 52414131
>Description:
the following DEFINEs are not in the dl.h implementation of HP

BIND_VERBOSE 0x20
BIND_NOSTART 0x10
>How-To-Repeat:
Just compile for HP-UX 8
>Fix:
I have been able to compile Apache with no problems by providing the values in os.h (I took them from HP-UX 10.20), and I have not found any problems up to this date. I admit I haven't tested the consequences of this "addition" at all (but Apache is working fine).

The code looks like this now (in os.h):

#ifdef HAVE_DL_H
#include <dl.h>
#define BIND_VERBOSE 0x20
#define BIND_NOSTART 0x10
#endif 

I suppose it would be better to check if its HPUX 8 with another IF, but this was a quick fix (no time for anything else, I needed to make Apache work).

Thanks
