State-Changed-When: Thu Feb  8 18:32:57 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Although they have the ".so" extension, these are actually
windows shared library files.  The extension was changed
to make things more consistent with the documentation
and to prevent windows explorer from hiding them as
system files.

Thanks for using Apache!
