>Environment:
SunOS darkwing 5.6 Generic_105181-06 sun4d sparc
>Description:
"apachectl status" returns the same information as "apachectl fullstatus"
because of some incorrect assumptions about lynx output.  We are running lynx
2.8, which by default wraps lines to fit in 80 columns and hence breaks the
words "current process" that are searched for to truncate the output of
"lynx --dump http://localhost/server-status"; since that string is not matched
the entire status output is displayed.

There also seems to be a portability problem with the awk script given.  I
was unable to get it to work using Solaris awk.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compare "apachectl status" output with "apachectl fullstatus" on a system with
lynx-2.8.
>Fix:
This patch changes the 'awk' call that edits down the "apachectl status"
information into a call to 'sed' which should work in more circumstances.  It
could probably be made even more general.

I've fixed this for the next Apache release with
a more portable awk solution.
Thanks for the note.
