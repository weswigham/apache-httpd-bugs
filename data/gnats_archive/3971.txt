>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 sp3
>Description:
Apache is running on a lightly hit (~200 hits/hr) server running Perl CGI 
scripts, some of which output large files (several MB).
Some time after starting, generally within an hour, the Apache child process 
will suddenly start using all available CPU.  The child continues handling
requests normally, but the entire system is bogged down.  When the child in 
this state reaches MaxRequestsPerChild, it hangs rather than exiting.  Also, 
attempting to shut down Apache results in this entry in the error.log, after
a long delay:
D:\Apache\Apache.exe: [Thu Feb 25 22:18:00 1999] [error] forcing termination of child #0 (handle 140)
>How-To-Repeat:
No idea how to repeat it.
>Fix:
Fix it?  I can't tell what's causing it!
