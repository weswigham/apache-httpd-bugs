redhat 7.2 kernel 2.4.12 (linux)	
>Description:
I am running httpd.
current time zone is IST
downloaded a page. checked the access log. It shows sorrect time zone(IST)
Now I modified the zone to GMT and downloaded another page. Checked the access log. It shows sorrect time zone( GMT)
Now I reverted it to IST. and downloaded another page. Checked the access log. It shows sorrect time zone( IST)
Now again I change it to GMT  and downloaded another page. Checked the access log. It still shows IST. Aftter this what ever is the zone I set to it shows IST only.  

If I restart it follows the changes in zone 2 times. Then it doesn't follow.
>How-To-Repeat:
start httpd.
say current time zone is IST
Download a page. check the access log. It shows sorrect time zone(IST)
Now I modify the zone to GMT and downloaded another page. Check the access log. It shows sorrect time zone( GMT)
Now I revert it to IST and download another page. Check the access log. It shows sorrect time zone( IST)
Now again change it to GMT  and download another page. Check the access log. It still shows IST. Aftter this what ever is the zone you set to, it shows IST only.
>Fix:
I have no clue. But I know how time zone is maintained in linux. While a process is running, if time zone changes it will not know abt the changes unless it monitors /etc/localtime or /etc/sysconfig/clock files.

But I am very interested in fixing this problem. If somebody can tell me how apache is taking currently handling this I will fix this.


U can least point me to corresponding file/func. I looked at ap_get_gmtoff. This function gives correct value first 2 times and after that it gives wrong value.  It doesn't do much except calling localtime and gmtime.

State-Changed-Why:
As you say, the Apache time funtions do not do much beyond calling your system time functions.  We can not explain why they behave the way they do.  Perhaps they only cache the timezone information after it has been used enough times to make it worthwhile.  Perhaps you are getting tricked by the fact that the time library in each child process could have its own cache of such things, so it may be on a per child process basis.

Regardless, changing the time zone on a running unix system is not something that it is reasonable to expect to take effect immediately in running processes, and I see no reason why this is a "bug" in Apache that should be fixed.

 Thanks marc
 
 I just have one doubt left. I wrote a test program to
 see if it catches the changes in time zone. It
 doesn't.
 What is apache doing? If possible please tell me. Or
 at least point me to some source.
 
 I am sorry if I am wasting ur time.
 
 Thanks

 apache is doing the same thing that any simplistic test program would do.  
 It doesn't do anything with time zones. It doesn't catch the changes
 inside a running process, however as new child processes are created they
 may or may not get updated time zones.  I can't tell you the precise
 details of how things happen to interact on the particular platform you
 are running on; there are a variety of legitimate behaviours by the system
 libraries that can produce different results, but still all be legal.
