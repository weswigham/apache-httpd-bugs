>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 SP2
Visual C++ 6 SP5
>Description:
When using an ISAPI extension an Access Violation is generated which is traceable back to the following code:

    bb = apr_brigade_create(r->pool);
    b = apr_bucket_transient_create(Buffer, (apr_size_t)lpwdwBytes);
    APR_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(bb, b);
    b = apr_bucket_eos_create();
    APR_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(bb, b);
    ap_pass_brigade(r->output_filters, bb);

The lpwdwBytes parameter that is used in the apr_bucket_transient_create function is a pointer and needs to be dereferenced before casting to the apr_size_t type.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the simple.dll ISAPI extension that is part of the Microsoft Platform SDK samples for IIS.
>Fix:
The problem can be with the following modification to the WriteClient function:

    b = apr_bucket_transient_create(Buffer, (apr_size_t)(*lpwdwBytes));
