>Description:
The Configure script fails when we ran it, producing the following output: -

UX:sh (GuessOS): ERROR: hostinfo: Not found
Creating Makefile in src
Sorry, but we cannot grok "DRS 6000-whatever-UNIX_SV|4.2MP|7MPlus.5.5"
uname -m
UX:uname: ERROR: Illegal option -- X
UX:uname: TO FIX: Usage:
        uname [-snrvmap]
        uname [-S system name]
DRS 6000
uname -r
4.2MP
uname -s
UNIX_SV
uname -v
7MPlus.5.5
uname -X
Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html. If you don't
wish to do the port yourself, please submit this output rather
than the patches. Thank you.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The entry in the GuessOS file for the DRS 6000 is incorrect. 
The script enty looks for the text DRS6000, then uname command returns DRS 6000.
The space causes it to fail. We modified the script and it worked OK.
