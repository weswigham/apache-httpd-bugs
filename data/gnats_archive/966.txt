Hi Alex,

Okay, when I use Activeware's Perl Win32 port on NT SP3 IIS 3.0, you have
the option of using Perl.exe or PerlIS.dll to run CGI Perl scripts on the
web server. Using PerlIS.dll is faster than Perl.exe.

I would want to accomplish the same thing with Apache for Windows. Instead
of the server using Perl.exe to run the Perl scripts, I want it to use
Activeware's ISAPI version of Perl, PerlIS.dll, to save some overhead in
running Perl Scripts.

Yes, you are right about the Perl scripts only working when invoked with
Perl.exe. Did I make myself clear?
Thanks for your help.
