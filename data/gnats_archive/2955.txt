>Environment:
NT 4.0 SP3 - using pre-compiled binaries
>Description:
I have an alias in srm.conf as follows:

Alias /aaa/bbb/ "//otherNTbox/shareName/subdirectoryName/"

such that when asked for 'http://myServer/aaa/bbb/', my server responds
with a directory listing of the subdirectory called 'subdirectoryName'
in the share called 'shareName' on the other server called 'otherNTbox. 
That's good.  What I now want to do is put a '.htaccess' file into
'subdirectoryName' to protect it.  BUT I cannot get Apache to read
and/or use this file.  Auth control within other areas of the docs tree
works, both aliased (e.g. the standard icons alias) and non-aliased.  So
I think I've got my general config right (for example AllowOverride
AuthConfig inside <Directory ...> for my DocumentRoot).

So, have I missed something or is this a bug in Apache 1.3.1 for Win32?

State-Changed-Why:

It's possible that the UNC directory path is falling afoul
of one of your <Directory> containers.  What <Directory>
containers do you have, and what are the AllowOverride
settings in them?  Also, please try the latest release
(currently 1.3.6) to see if the problem persists.
