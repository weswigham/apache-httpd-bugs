Linux linux.quidnunc.int 2.2.14-5.0 #1 Tue Mar 7 21:07:39 EST 2000 i686 unknown

gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
>Description:
The following mod_include SSI code:
<!--#set var="Q_MAIN_HEADING" value="Issue 001 &ndash; QLogger" -->

Generates the HTML - 

Issue 001 &amp;ndash; QLogger 

ie, the ampersand is being escaped and converted into an &amp; HTML character entity.

None of the usual escaping tricks I tried \& '&' or && allowed me to get the desired output (which is obviously &ndash;)

(BTW - your bug database seems to be at least partly broken. All queries return no results.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a page which uses the above server side include code and view it.
>Fix:
Why are you escaping & in this context? If it is necessary, then please allow escaping & with a backslash \&

State-Changed-Why:

I assume your problem is not actually with "set",
but rather with "echo".  If so, please see the
"encoding" option to the "echo" element.

Thanks for using Apache!
