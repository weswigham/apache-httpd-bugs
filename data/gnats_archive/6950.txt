>Description:
In My http.conf I have next:

RewriteMap my_map prg:/home/web/conf/parser.pl
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^(www\.)?ukrbiz\.net$
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ ${my_map:%{HTTP_HOST}$1} [L]

In 1.3.12 all works fine, but on 1.3.14 passed to my Perl Script parameters is broken.

In rewrite log file I found something like that:
map lookup FAILED map=ubiz_map key=%{HTTP_HOST

May be in new version something happens with parsing and recognising in map key values
>How-To-Repeat:
Repeat my example of my httpd.conf file in your system and create parser.pl script like that:

#!/usr/bin/perl
$| = 1;
$base_dir = "/home/web/htdocs/kbd/";
while (<>) {
   print $_;
}

 Just about all useful use of RewriteMaps (including the examples in
 the documentation) has been lost due the a security fix added to
 1.3.14, described by this comment:
 
 /*
  * for security reasons this expansion must be perfomed in a
  * single pass, otherwise an attacker can arrange for the result
  * of an earlier expansion to include expansion specifiers that
  * are interpreted by a later expansion, producing results that
  * were not intended by the administrator.
  */
 
 If the map key contains a variable, that variable no longer gets expanded!
 
 I'm thinking a simple fix is to recursively call do_expand() on
 the map "key" and  "dflt" (default) strings.
 I think this still secure because only runs do_expand on parts
 of the substitution pattern that have not been expanded yet.
 
 I also note that the code doesn't handle nested map expressions,
 but I don't think it ever did.

This is a known bug.  Please see

or wait for the next release of Apache, due out
in the next week or so.

 That's exactly the fix that has been committed to CVS.
