>Description:
Squid (http://squid.nlanr.net/) is a very good proxy server.  In those
features of Squid, I think its "-k" parameter can be useful for Apache.
We can issue "squid -k reconfigure" to let squid re-read configuration
files.
"squid -k shutdown" to shutdown to squid process.
"squid -k rotate" to rename all current "*.log" to "*.log.1" and then
write the following messages to the newly created "*.log".
I think "-k rotate" is most useful to Apache since we can not delete Apache's
log files directly. 
Please consider the chance of adding these parameters to Apache httpd.
Thanks a lot!

 I DID read that pages and operate httpd in this way in my daily life.
 kill -TERM or -HUP are good ways, too.  I just think it would be
 wonderful if Apache also have those squid-like friendly syntax.
 
 And log rotation is useful. Only the httpd process know when it
 should rotate the log.  Use kill -USR1 and delay a period of time
 to rotate log is inconvenient. 
 
 I know Apache group are busy and want to say "Thank you" to all of
 you. 
 
 Sincerely yours,
 Eric Chang
