>Environment:
This is occurring on both Solaris 2.5.1 and Linux 2.2.4 and 2.2.5
>Description:
I received notification that a user was able to browse my server's directories.
Stripping the filename off the URL I too was presented with a directory list.
The list included index.html.  Checking the system I confirmed that index.html
was indeed a symbolic link back to another directory's index.html (this
directory was created by a web-based script and linked rather than copied
index.html)

DirectoryIndex is set to index.html and FollowSymLinks is activated.

Replacing the linked file with a static file solved the problem instantly.

Symbolic links are definitely working as all the CGI scripts in the directory
are linked back to the same directory as the original index.html.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create one directory with index.html, create another directory with index.html
linked back to the original.  View through browser.
>Fix:
It would seem that a test is occurring that does not acknowledge index.html
as a legitimate file.  Simple fix - honor the sym-linked index.html.

 Ah geez - I could shoot myself - my bad - false alarm - close this and chalk it
 up to user stupidity.
 
 Sorry,
