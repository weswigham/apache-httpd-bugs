>Description:
Using ErrorDocument directives for some error codes seem to cause a server error when redirecting to a local script.

ErrorDocument 403 /server/error_document.cgi

works fine whereas

ErrorDocument 410 /server/error_document.cgi

causes a server failure.
>How-To-Repeat:
I assume it's sufficient to edit .htaccess to include any response codes Apache doesn't use.
>Fix:
Ignore unknown response codes

State-Changed-Why:

ErrorDocument only works with response codes that are
known to the server.  Apache 1.2 will support the complete
set of HTTP/1.1 response codes.  However, non-standard
response codes must be added to the tables in http_protocol.c
and httpd.h before they can be used with ErrorDocument.
