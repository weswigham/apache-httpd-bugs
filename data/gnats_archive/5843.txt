>Description:
Our apache is running in an AFS envrionment. Before starting the server a token is generated with 'klog -setpag' -> then the server is started by 'apachectl start';
After a while we encounter access fobidden messages (403) due to problems of some server processes getting access to files in AFS. A reload sometimes helps, sometimes not. It looks like that the processes (perhaps only new forked processes) run into trouble. The amount of processes which loose access increase, so after a while new start is necessary and all runs very properly for a while again.
AFS reqires in the group list two 'pag numbers' to handle the access to AFS files. Is it possible that apache forks processes in different ways, so that some new processes loose this group list entries? It is magically, that a new started server run very properly.
May affect 'startservers' or 'min/max sprare servers' the way processes are forked?
Is there a way to log the process envrionment after it is frresh forked?
