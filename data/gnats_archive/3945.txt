HP-UX B.11.00
gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
htpasswd.c calls tmpnam(NULL) which is okay if not compiled with multithreading
but causes a problem if compiled with -lpthread (Message is "Could not open temp
file".).  Changing tmpnam(NULL) to tempnam(NULL, NULL) appears to correct the
problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with -lpthread and run htpasswd against an existing entry
>Fix:
Suggested fix - use tempnam(NULL, NULL) instead of tmpnam(NULL)

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed

State-Changed-When: Wed May  3 11:00:22 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
As of the next release after 1.3.12, Apache will pass a
buffer in to tmpnam(), avoiding this problem.  Thanks!
