client side: Netscape Navigator 3.0 Gold
>Description:
I have a setup with a vhost that defines

ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/notthere.cgi

inside the vhost section. When asking this vhost for a nonexistend URL that
contains a space, the first part up to the space is placed in REDIRECT_URL
and the part after the space comes out in front of SERVER_PROTOCOL. I didn't
test with variants that contain more spaces, more non-contiguous sections of
spaces, or different kinds of spaces.

I posted this to comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix

message id <33C69ACE.E442F3@oeko.net>,

and got back that this is likely an Apache bug. This could have security
implications since smashing the stack by producing unpredicted environment
contents and possibly executing it afterwards could therefore be embedded
in the URL if properly designed, or so I read on bugtraq.

Imho the right thing would be that all the illegal URL lands in the
REDIRECT_URL variable and also that it be limited to some harmless size.

The right thing must be known somewhere in Apache since the access log
contains the correct URI (the one originally requested, together with a 404
status code).




>How-To-Repeat:
If you have a mail address I can mail you a sample code section + server
setup, but you should be able to repeat the problem with your stock CGI pieces.
>Fix:
Disallow spaces in URLs (if at all legal) and have them length checked if not
already

State-Changed-Why:
I have already responded to your post on the newsgroup.

If the client makes a request such as:

     GET /ab cd.html HTTP/1.0

then Apache is perfectly justified in treating that as
a request for /ab with a protocol of cd.html with some
crap on the end or a protocol of "cd.html HTTP/1.0".
Any spaces in URLs must be % escaped or else it is completely
bogus.

Apache is giving your ErrorDocument script what it gets.  If
the client doesn't follow the rules and escape things properly,
then it is completely impossible to guess what it wants; you
will be wrong some of the time no matter how you guess.

The "right thing" is not known anywhere in Apache; when it logs
it in the access log, it logs the document (/ab) and protocol
(cd.html HTTP/1.0).  There is no reason to think this has any security implications.

 Hello,

 sorry, I didn't see that here.
 
 > Any spaces in URLs must be % escaped or else it is completely
 > bogus.
 
 Accepted. I don't want spaces in URLs anyway, I only fear that someone
 will crack our servers. That's because this problem arises no matter
 what URI is actually called for.
 
 
 > will be wrong some of the time no matter how you guess.
 
 Ok.
 
 > (cd.html HTTP/1.0).  There is no reason to think this has any security implications.
 
 Ok. Phew...
 
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Toni.
