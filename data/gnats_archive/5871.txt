>Description:
In Apache 2.0, The default name of the executable seems to have changed from 'httpd' to 'apache'. This change is not reflected in the value of DEFAULT_PIDLOG, which is still set to 'httpd.pid'. A minor issue, but for matters of consistency, the value of DEFAULT_PIDLOG could perhaps be changed to 'apache.pid'.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Change the definition of DEFAULT_PIDLOG in mpm_default.h, which resides in:
src/modules/mpm/dexter/mpm_default.h
src/modules/mpm/mpmt_beos/mpm_default.h
src/modules/mpm/mpmt_pthread/mpm_default.h
src/modules/mpm/prefork/mpm_default.h
src/modules/mpm/spmt_os2/mpm_default.h
src/modules/mpm/winnt/mpm_default.h
