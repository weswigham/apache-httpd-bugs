>Environment:
Linux version 2.1.71 (root@merv) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) i586
	
>Description:
When I serve a page (by cgi) that works fine with apache 1.2.4
but use apache 1.3b3, my linux box hangs.  This is moderately 
repeatable, and the hang is sudden, with no log information
anywhere.  Obviously this is at least partly a problem with 
linux, but I thought I'd pass it along.	
>How-To-Repeat:
I get it in a running log page: log in as a new user with any username at
  merv.philosophy.lsa.umich.edu/~markcrim/WorkoutLog.html
This should give you a two-month calendar page.  The system freeze happens
near the top (before the calendar tables are loaded).

Sorry, I'm an idiot

 Can you reproduce this with a kernel version in the 2.0.x series?  Can you
 reproduce it with the latest 2.1.x? 
 
 Do you have ScriptLog enabled?  If so read PR#607

 I don't have 2.0.x handy.  I am running a 2.1.x kernel that was current
 a week or so ago (one version behind).  I can do a bit of testing,
 but I really don't want to keep crashing my machine right at the
 moment.
 
 Actually, I'm actively developing the cgi script, and now I don't
 get the system crashing (yet).  Believe me, it was very reliable
 and happened about 8 time at the same spot delivering the same html
 page.  Sorry not to be a more responsible bug tracker.
