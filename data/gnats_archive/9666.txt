>Description:
I haven't run into this problem in previous versions of configure for apache.
I think it started in versions 1.3.2x.
I must put the --prefix argument last in the configure command call, otherwise
I get :

Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.23
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
configure:Error: invalid option '--activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a'


which I thought to be an error in my initial apache build, but after 
all kinds of wasted time, I found that it was the order of the arguments.

I know this is a small problem, but to a newbie like me ( 2 years of experience installing these packages ) it was a big waste of my time.

What happened?
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --prefix=/mnt/disk2/incnet/apache --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a
>Fix:
./configure --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a --prefix=/mnt/disk2/incnet/apache
