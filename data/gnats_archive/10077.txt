System: Linux turk-xu 2.2.16 #1 SMP Wed Nov 8 10:57:03 GMT 2000 s390 unknown.

>Description:
2 weeks ago,the Apache http still worked ok. But in the last week, the system was crashed with unknown reason and rebooted. However, httpd server has not been started automatically again since then. So I added the command '/usr/sbin/httpd -f /etc/httpd/httpd.conf -D MODULES -D PERL -D DAV -D PHP' into 'etc/inittab' file and rebooted the system again. But the server still could not work properly. Later, I found it was not the way to start the httpd server at boot time, so I commented that command and typed '/etc/rc.d/apache start' to start it manually. But it showed this:

turk-xu:/etc/httpd # /etc/rc.d/apache start 
Starting service httpd/etc/rc.d/apache: line 138:  2364 Segmentation fault      /usr/sbin/httpd -t -f /etc/httpd/httpd.conf $MODULES >/dev/null 2>&1
: syntax error in httpd.conf                                          failed

Then I did this:

turk-xu:/etc/httpd # /usr/sbin/httpd -t
Syntax OK

It really confused me. I did the check and it gave me no error but when I wanted to start the server, it showed up the syntex error. Why?
I have never maken any changes on 'etc/rc.d/apache' and '/etc/httpd/httpd.conf'files before. If I can not start it like this way how to start the http server automatically with standalone servertype.
>How-To-Repeat:
Give the reason why this could happen and the way how to fix it or
give me a another way to start the httpd server automatically.
>Fix:
Sorry, I have no idea.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
