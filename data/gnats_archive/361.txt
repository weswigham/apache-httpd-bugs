State-Changed-When: Sat Apr 19 15:27:10 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Please try adding -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to your 
EXTRA_CFLAGS in your Configuration and rebuild.  I'm guessing
that you're using multiple Listen statements, and we've just
discovered a problem with that.

State-Changed-Why:
Closing this out since it appears to be solved by serialized
accepts.  The permanent fix for that problem will be tracked
by PR#467.

Thanks
