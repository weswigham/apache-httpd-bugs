>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Redhat Linux 6.2, jserv 2.0
>Description:
I want my servlet (Apache/Jserv) to read a log file at the
other machine on the network, so I mount a directory in that
machine to my machine:

mount ftp.foo.com:/dir/dir /remote

Because of some unknown reason, the connection of 2 machine is
broken. However, the servlet don't throw a
FileNotFoundException or IOException but a
java.net.BindException.
Actually I have put this statement in a try-catch block which
catch All Exception to prevent such error, but JVM don't catch
it.
Do you consider it is a Bug of JVM or Jserv or JSDK?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to mount a directory from NFS and broken the connection and get a file from it
>Fix:
Report FileNotFoundException even in NFS
