>Description:
This file http://www.nagual.pp.ru/~ache/abug/a.kk is gzipped text. When
mod_mime_magic tries to access it, core dumped, here error.log output lines:

mod_mime_magic: read failed (No such file or directory).
httpd: caught SIGSEGV, attempting to dump core in /usr/local/etc/apache

"read failed" string occurse only once in mime_magic: when uncompressing
process is running. "No such file or directory" strange error for read...
Sorry, not have a core for backtrace available.
>How-To-Repeat:
Copy http://www.nagual.pp.ru/~ache/abug/a.kk into empty directory
and try to browse it from outside.
>Fix:
Hmm. It looks like somthing wrong with pipe code...
