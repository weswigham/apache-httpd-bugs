Hi!

I'm having problems getting PHP4 to work with ApacheJServ DSO. Have tried PHP4 as DSO and as static. If I remove JServ then PHP4 works just fine, but as soon as I load the JServ DSO php scripts turn up as source. Have tried different loading order for JServ and PHP4. JServ works fine in any case.

1.PHP4:
./configure --with-mysql --with-apache=../apache_1.3.14 --enable-track-vars --enable-trans-sid --with-ftp --with-sybase=/usr/local/freetds

1.Appache:
./configure –-prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=usertrack --enable-module=so --enable-module=auth_db --enable-module=log_agent --enable-module=vhost_alias --enable-module=info --enable-module=log_referer --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a --enable-module=php4

2.PHP4
./configure --with-mysql --with-apxs --enable-track-vars --enable-trans-sid --with-ftp --with-sybase=/usr/local/freetds

PHP-4.0.4, Apache 1.3.14, JServ 1.1.2, RH High Availability

Sorry if I'm not supposed to post this here.
