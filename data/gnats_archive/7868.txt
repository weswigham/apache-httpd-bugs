>Description:
I made a heavily modified config.layout entry "Customized" and built apache as follows.

#   Customized Apache path layout for multi-machine multi-architecture setup
<Layout Customized>
    prefix:        /local/shared/apache
    exec_prefix:   /local/arch/apache
    bindir:        $exec_prefix/bin
    sbindir:       $exec_prefix/bin
    libexecdir:    $exec_prefix/modules
    mandir:        $prefix/man
    sysconfdir:    /local/system/apache/conf
    datadir:       /local/shared/apache
    iconsdir:      $datadir/icons
    htdocsdir:     $datadir/htdocs
    cgidir:        $datadir/cgi-bin
    includedir:    $prefix/include
    localstatedir: /local/system/apache
    runtimedir:    $localstatedir/logs
    logfiledir:    $prefix/logs
    proxycachedir: $localstatedir/proxy
</Layout>

I then built it as:

./configure  --enable-auth-db --enable-dav --enable-dav-fs --enable-vhost-alias --enable-rewrite --enable-layout=Customized

I then installed it:

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag

more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

State-Changed-Why:
Much work has gone into the build system since .16, so while
I cannot validate it at the moment, I'm quite certain the
problem you had is gone.  Please try the next alpha release
as it is announced, and reply if we need to reopen this report.

Thanks for participating in Apache 2.0 beta development!
