OpenBSD 2.3 i386, gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
It has come to my attention that when specifying a 
<!--#include virtual="a few /'s(one will do)"--> 
directive, you may be able to make apache cause a system to crash eventually. 
On my system (AMD K6 200 w/64mb of ram,3200rpm hdd) the load average raised a 
steady .2 points each second or so. 
Top reported this after starting the "attack":
PID USERNAME PRI NICE  SIZE   RES STATE WAIT     TIME    CPU COMMAND
5467 nobody    95    0   13M 9580K run   -        2:00 121.24% httpd
Probably 20 seconds or so into it.
This is somewhat similar to the past dos attacks with 1.2.4 and earlier using
a large amount of /'s in the url request.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well, first you have to enable SSI's for the file you are going to use 
this include directive in:
---
srm.conf:
AddHandler server-parsed file.type (I put index.html)
---
Within the file.type, inside a document root, you would put
<!--#include virtual="/"-->
The attack comes just from trying to load the file over http.
Even after I stop trying to load the file, apache still consumes more and
more resources until I restart the daemon(sighup is enough).
Will not work if you have too many /'s inside the virtual="" directive.
>Fix:
Someone needs to work on the handle_include() function inside mod_include.c,
adding code to ignore single and consecutive /'s without leading text?

State-Changed-Why:
There is nothing wrong with using <!--#include virtual="/"-->
and it should be permitted.

This appears like it may be due to recursive includes.
You didn't mention this, but is the file you are including
"/" from the file that gets served when you ask for "/"?
That is the only way I can duplicate this, and there is
a fairly obvious cause for this behaviour when trying to do
a recursive include.

Apache does do some checking to try to avoid recursive
includes, but obviously it doesn't go far enough, probably due to
the translation being done from / to index.html by mod_index.

 That is exactly this case, recursive includes.
 The only problem here though is that it eventually will crash
 the machine. At least the machine that this was tested on.
 
 I guess we will have to trust our users that they won't try to
 exploit this for now. <g>

 Or simply do what is recommended anyway: set a ulimit on the amount of
 memory a httpd process can use before you start it.  This protects against
 40394 DoS attacks with a minimal or nil impact on legitimate use.

A fix to prevent this, plus other infinite recursive includes,
has been committed and will be available in 1.3.4.
