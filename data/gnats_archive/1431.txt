>Description:
RewriteMap programs isn't spawned when Rewriteengine is turned on in serverconfig.
When I use the rewritemap from inside a directory config(access.conf), apache 
writes and reads fd 0 instead the program.

The problem goes away if I turn on the Rewriteengine in srm.conf.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up rewritemap programs in srm.conf and turn rewriteengine on for directory. 
Use the rewritemap which is associated with the program, apache will read and write 
to fd0

State-Changed-Why:
The fact that the RewriteMap program is not available
in per-dir context when the per-server context is disabled
is ok. It is intended this way because of security reasons
(only the admin can define maps and if he disables one
 it should remain disabled even if the user thinks you
 wants to use it).

But the second point the submitter of the report gives
us was correct: The usage of fd 0 was incorrect. Now
a lookup of such a disabled map leads to a lookup failure.
This was fixed for 1.3b6-dev now.
