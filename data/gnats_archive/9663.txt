 ...........................................................
  
 REGISTER TODAY, AS CAMP SPOTS ARE MOVING FAST!
 
 Tony DiCicco will be your coach 
 
 Gulfport, Mississippi - January 31, 2002 - 
 Ever dreamed of playing soccer with the best players in 
 the world? Well, wake up soccer fans and get on it 
 because your dreams are coming true! 
 
 Introducing the Michelle Akers All-Star Fantasy Camp, 
 September 6-9, 2002, the first fantasy camp designed 
 specifically for women's soccer. Your host is FIFA's 
 Player of the Century and a two-time World Champion, 
 Michelle Akers, and her VIP staff of Camp Counselors 
 includes Julie Foudy, Tiffeny Milbrett, Brandi Chastain 
 and Tony DiCicco - World Champions one and all.
 
 No dorm rooms with bunk beds for our Campers. No, 
 you will stay at the Oasis Resort & Spa on the beautiful 
 shores of the Gulf of Mexico in Gulfport, Mississippi. 
 That's right -- soccer, luxury and fun in the sun. All 
 abilities are invited to register but the Camp is exclusive 
 to women, 21-years older and up.
 
 Due to the anticipated high demand for the limited 
 number of camp openings - just 100 - each position will 
 be auctioned individually at www.eBay.com and will go 
 to the highest bidder. Proceeds from the Camp will go 
 to Soccer Outreach International, the non-profit youth 
 leadership initiative that Akers founded in 1997. For 
 more information and registration, visit 
 www.MichelleAkers.com or
