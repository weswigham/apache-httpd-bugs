>Description:
I am trying to user RedirectMatch to redirect to a servlet.  The config line looks like:

RedirectMatch ^/admin(.*)$ http://my.site.com/webj?func=y\&t=1$1

Apache is HTML encoding the '?' as %3f, which causes my servlet to be unable to parse the variable string.  (%3f designates specifically to not treat it as a parameter).

If I user Redirect the string is not HTML encodes (unfortunately I need reg-ex parsing or I wouldn't be writing this).

The following works correctly (the '?' is not encoded):

Redirect /admin http://my.site.com/webj?func=y&1

I read through all of the bug report and saw no mention of this, so I did not bother to upgrade from 1.3.1 to 1.3.3.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create two redirects:

Redirect /junk http://your.server.com/junk?x=1&y=2 (works)

final URL looks like : http://your.server.com/junk?x=1&y=2

RedirectMatch ^/junk2(.*) http://your.server.com/junk?x=1\&u=2$1 (encodes the '?')

final URL looks like: http://your.server.com/junk%3fx=1&u=2
>Fix:
RedirectMatch likely is doing an HTML encode unnecessarily.
