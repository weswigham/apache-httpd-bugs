>How-To-Repeat:
It worked before.
Nothing wrong happened and it doesn't work any mmore
>Fix:
When launching manually httpds with right environnement variable (such as PERL5LIB) it seems to works fine. (Apache is started)
only apachectl won't work.

State-Changed-Why:
You don't give any information on what third party modules you are using, but it seems clear that the problem does not lie in Apache itself... you seem to be using mod_perl.  We have no idea what is going on with mod_perl, and that appears to be where it is dying.  If there are environment variables that have to be set, then you need to set them before running apachectl or in apachectl.  There is no magic to what apachectl does...
