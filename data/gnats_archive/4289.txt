gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
If i compile some modules as shared ones the server doesn't stars. The error 
message is the following:

Syntax error on line 207 of /dsd/www/new/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /dsd/www/new/libexec/mod_env.so into server: 
 ld.so.1: /dsd/www/new/bin/httpd: fatal: 
 relocation error: file /dsd/www/new/libexec/mod_env.so: 
 symbol ap_palloc: referenced symbol not found
bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

This is the first used ap_* symbol from the first try of loading a shared
module.

The same is the problem with 1.3.{0,1} i don't try the other versions but 
probably 1.3.0-6 is affected.
>How-To-Repeat:
I do a 
configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max
make
make install

but it should be the same with any shared module
