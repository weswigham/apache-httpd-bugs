State-Changed-Why:
Sounds strange. Seems like a conflict between the
<Files> stuff and the RewriteRule. I cannot see
any reason why a correctly rewritten URL by mod_rewrite
causes the wrong CGi script to be executed. Actually
I think its not a problem by mod_rewrite but there
is no proof for this. I'll test it myself at a later
time when I find more time. Can you please send my
your complete(!) config files (i.e. including
the mod_perl sections etc.) plus the index.cgi and
owa scripts for local testing?

Anyone! -

I'm having trouble rewriting a URL for our home page.  Rewrite of "/sf"
(with no slash at end) works fine, "/sf/" (with slash at end), goes La-La.
Is this a bug, or am I missing something?  (may be related to apbugs PR
number 1938 ?  My DocumentRoot does *not* have a slash at the end.)

I have a work-around that works for me (see below), but here is the problem:

My Rewrite directives:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteLog /u1/savesmart.com/logs/rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 9
RewriteRule /sf$ /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi
RewriteRule /sf/$ /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi
RewriteRule /san_francisco$ /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi
RewriteRule /san_francisco/owa/(.*)$ /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/owa/$1
RewriteRule /san_francisco/CGI/(.*)$ /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/$1

<Files ~ /u1/test.savesmart.com/cgi-bin/(owa|index.cgi$)>
# mod_perl is activated here
</Files>

The resultant rewrite log (on URL http://savesmart.com/sf/ ) is

(2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /sf/
(2) rewrite /sf/ -> /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi
(2) local path result: /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi
(1) go-ahead with /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi [OK]

Which looks just fine!  However, the program that gets executed is "owa",
not "cgi-bin" ! ! ! !


My (personal) work-around is:
Now if that don't surprize you, then maybe it's 'cause you know that if the
Rewrite rule is written:

RewriteRule /sf/$ /u1/savesmart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/

(note slash at end), then it will work as one would expect.

This seems like a bug rather than a feature, since the result of not
duplicating the trailing slash results in entirely inexplicable behavior.
If you can explain it, please let me know.

Just an Apache beginner,
