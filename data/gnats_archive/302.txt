>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know. I ask some people in France and someone says he has the same
message on SCO Unix
>Fix:
Maybe TCP parameters. I read the page http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/fin_wait_2.html
talking about FIN_WAIT2 problem, they suggest to recompile without the
 -DNO_LINGCLOSE flag

State-Changed-Why:
Don't worry about them, they are probably just extraneous
debugging output.  They may be removed for the next
release.
