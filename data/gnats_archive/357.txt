>Environment:
UnixWare 2.1.1, fully patched, cc compiler
>Description:
in the project. At New Years time I went through a big exchange on
Apache 1.2b7 failing to work properly on UnixWare. The final solutions
were to ensure both NO_LINGCLOSE and USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
were defined. The latter is still handled most casually in the shipped
Configuration file, and that's bad news for SYS V as well as just
UnixWare sites. Somehow the group isn't exchanging this kind of
information, but needs to before 1.2 is released. I don't know who
your UnixWare tester is, but it's not working out.

I'll be putting pages up this weekend for UnixWare. They've

release.
