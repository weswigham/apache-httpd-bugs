>Organization:
>Environment:
Win NT 4.0 Workstation SP 3 Multiprocessor Kernel
Precompiled Apache Version 1.3.12 (Win32)
PHP/4.0.0
Perl v5.6.0 MSWin32-x86-multi-thread

>Description:
Apache calls a CGI-scripts without setting the PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED environment variables. I don't know if these are *required* by the CGI Specs but notably PHP 4.0.0 dies without them.

I already have tried the suggestion in PR number 5077. Nothing changes.

Here are the relevant parts of my httpd.conf.

ScriptAlias /php/  "C:/Prj/mind-FACTory/Homepage/php/"
ScriptAlias /perl/ "C:/Prj/mind-FACTory/Homepage/php/"

<Directory "C:/Prj/mind-FACTory/Homepage/php">
    ScriptInterpreterSource registry
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
</Directory>

AddHandler cgi-script .php
AddHandler cgi-script .pl

>How-To-Repeat:
Install this perl-script as CGI. It prints all environment variables. PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED are not there.

#!C:/perl/bin/perl

print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
print "<table>\n";

foreach $key (sort keys %ENV) {
   print qq|<tr><th align="right" valign="top">$key&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><td>$ENV{$key}</td></tr>\n|;
}
print "</table>\n";

>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:

If there is not additional path info, then the envrionment
variables are not created.  You are describing a bug in
PHP that assumes they exist, instead of testing for their
presence.
