>Description:
I tried to search the database but it just hung, so I am filing a report

when I do a directory listing, I am getting stray data, such as request_uri's
and remote hosts which appears to be from log data. it shows up in the
directory listing, covered by the filenames

I am used the spelling module, mod_perl, etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://tiberio.com/humor/

please don't complain if it was already reported; the database search was not working
>Fix:
i recently added a patch to apache when I had a problem with it crashing
all the time. i think I patched include/ap_config.h

dont remember what i changed so i put the file here:

State-Changed-Why:

1.3.4 is quite old.  I believe this bug was fixed in 1.3.6.
Please upgrade to the latestversion (1.3.9) and see if
the problem still occurs.  Thanks for using Apache!
