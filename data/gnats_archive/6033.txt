>Description:
Someone who understands mod_status should probably take a look at                                                                 
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_status.html                                  
                                                                                
The documentation refers to a compile-time change to activate                   
enhanced status logging.  I believe that this has been replaced                 
by the runtime directive ExtendStatus.  If so, the documentation                
is incorrect and should be changed.
