>Description:
Hi,
   My name is Rexon , working for Hewlett-Packard. I got a quick question on Tomcat + Apache, Could you please help me to clarify error occured in mod_jk.log.

I had installed Tomcat 3.3a + Apache 1.3.23 on WinNT OS Service Pack 5. 

Configuration settings
------------------------


workers.properties:
------------------------
worker.ajp13.port=8009
worker.ajp13.host=localhost
worker.ajp13.type=ajp13


Server.xml
------------
<Ajp13Connector port="8009" />


prof-server.xml
----------------
<RequestInterceptor 
className="org.apache.ajp.tomcat33.Ajp13Interceptor"
address="127.0.0.1"
port="8009" />


wrappers.properties
---------------------
wrapper.shutdown_port=8009
wrapper.shutdown_protocol=ajp13


tomcat.conf 
--------------
ApJServManual off

tomcat.properties
---------------------
# Set the port Apache JServ listens to.
# Syntax: port=[1024,65535] (int)
# Default: 8007
port=8009




mod_jk.log
-----------
[jk_connect.c (143)]: jk_open_socket, connect() failed errno = 61
[jk_ajp13_worker.c (196)]: In jk_endpoint_t::connect_to_tomcat, failed errno=61
[jk_ajp13_worker.c (635)]: Error connecting to the Tomcat process.


Everything works fine, if Tomcat & Apache started seperately. I think I had done all settings, Apache does'nt start Tomcat due to socket error.


Thanks a lot,

Regards,
Rexon

You'll have much better luck getting information on this
if you bring it to the tomcat developers under jakarta.apache.org.  The httpd developers can't help too
much with tomcat.
