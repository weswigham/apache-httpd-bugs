I get this error in all version of apache > 1.3.19 (2.x not included).

If I want to compile a new apache, I get the following error:
-------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not such a leet coder as you guys are, but I tried to define it manual. It compiled, but lots of segment faults during the spawnning of child processes.

So, you have any idea what this can be? glibc/gcc/etc not updated since install of slackware 7.0, but 1.3.19 compiles just fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a Linux box with slackware 7.0, kernel 2.2.19. Then compile apache > 1.3.19.

No
