>Environment:
RedHat 5.? base with upgraded libc, custom-built apache. running egcs-2.91.66.
Happened with Linux 2.2.10 through 2.2.14.  Running mod_perl as a DSO, but the 
problem occurs on pages not being run through mod_perl
>Description:
Apache is consuming as much as 98% CPU time on a single request.
  These requests are typically .gif's and robots.txt's.  The 
only pattern is the requestor, which has always been either an 
AOL proxy or an inktomi engine (FYI, according to inktomi's 
site, they seem to run AOL's proxy servers).  Anyway, usually 
the requests are OK, but every once in a while, a request will 
simply seem to spin into a loop and get stuck using up all of my 
CPU time.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, I cannot give a repeatable example.  If you
have any ideas of ways to do so (or have a copy of inktomi's 
software to run tests with) I will be happy to cooperate
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
Please try using a current version of Apache.  Also, try
attaching to one of the runaway processes with strace or gdb
(compile with -g if necessary for debugging symbols) to see
what is going on.
