uname -a:
Linux paragon2 2.2.12-20 #1 Mon Sep 27 10:25:54 EDT 1999 i586 unknown

Installed this RPM: apache-1.3.9-8.i386.rpm
>Description:
The returned HTTP header "Server:" always includes the OS information if it is set 
to Min, OS, or Full.

mod_headers cannot replace the Server: HTTP header to make this a non-issue.
>How-To-Repeat:
I would "ASSUME" that if you installed apache-1.3.9-8.i386.rpm on RedHat v6.1, you would see the same thing. :)
>Fix:
It looks like ap_add_version_component() is being called to add the OS version info when it shouldn't be.

State-Changed-Why:
It sounds like Redhat hacked the source to get this.
You should talk to them.
Thanks for using Apache.
