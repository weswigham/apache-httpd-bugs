As you can notice, I have the reply 200 OK.

When I am using netscape to access the page

http://hostname/~ferland/mat7420/

I see the message:waiting for reply... and it can wait indefinitevely.
It will NEVER be display.

When I look in the access log, I have:

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr 27 08:46:28 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
You are using a very old version of Solaris with multiple
known serious TCP stack bogons.  Please upgrade to a current
version or, if that isn't possible, be very sure you have all
the most current patches installed.

This doesn't look like it is an Apache problem.
