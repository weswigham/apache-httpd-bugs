>Description:
Please refer to PR#809 and PR#2926 for similar reports pointing to the same 
(unfixed) bug.

You need to fix this bug resp. non-feature asap. It is increasingly common for 
stock market websites to provide streaming data to Java clients via HTTP, 
and the Apache proxy can't handle this. It will buffer data from the streamer
instead of passing it to the client immediately.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following URL points to a streamer site. Submitting this URL directly to 
the server via a manual telnet connection to port 80 will yield an intermittent
stream of small binary data packets. The same request will get buffered to 
death by an Apache proxy.

A sample Netscape/IE Java client which uses this service is located at 
http://www.isld.com/itchclient/javaversion.htm. 
>Fix:
I suggest to watch for the "Server: Streamer" pragma which most streaming 
sites send in the response header. If the server is a streamer, the proxy 
should pass all received data on to the client right away.
