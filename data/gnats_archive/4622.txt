>Release:        1.3.6 & 1.0 final
>Environment:
NT Server 4.0, SP3, JRE 1.2, JSDK2.0
>Description:
The installation is not working on my system, I've tried it several times. I recently had to write an installer for our product, which has to install JRun during our InstallShield process, so I know what a pain in the neck this can be.

We're looking for an alternative to JRun to run our servlet-based web-based training package, and it looks like your JServ may be exactly what we need, but I can't get it to install.

I've got a plain vanilla installation, with the 1.2 JRE in program files\javasoft, the JSDK in c:\JSDK2.0, and Apache in program files\apache.

This appears in Apache's error log:

File does not exist: c:/program files/apache group/apache/htdocs/jserv
>How-To-Repeat:
Install 1.3.6 on an NT box. Reboot. Install JServ. Notice that the jserv folder does not get created in the apache webroot. Also, the shortcut which gets created on the start menu is to "C:\http:/\localhost\jserv" - this is when trying to check whether or not JServ is running. 
>Fix:
Spend some time on the installer. We had to come up with a test plan for each installer for each version of our software that we release, which has to install our product, plus the 1.2 JRE, plus LiveSoftware's JRun. We've got to test it on 95,98,NT and Solaris before we release each version. Set up boxes with each OS, then run the installer a couple of times. Move things to places outside the ordinary.

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug. What you are expecting is not correct. You should never put your .class files in the htdocs webroot because then they would be available for download by anybody! Your .class files for your servlets should be located in the repository= directory defined in the zone.properties file. The .class files do not need to be installed because mod_jserv tells Apache to remap the directory paths. I hope that explains things further.
