>Description:
System running out of file descirptors.  Quick check of /proc/*/fd/* indicates
that any error log file descriptor that opens, is not closing.  Quickly running
against 65,000 limit max in Linux kernel.

This system hosts about 400 virtual domains, each with a Listen directive (Yes,
I have read the FAQ).  The problem is that each server instance is keeping
any error logs it has ever opened, open.
>How-To-Repeat:
Misc URL's on www.host-all.com give "unable to fork" errors.  Error logs
indicate there are not enough system file descriptors to fork().
Sample URL: http://www.anewdesign.com/echat36/public/  
>Fix:
Look around for something that would keep the file descriptors open to just
the Error Logs!

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun May 16 21:23:10 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
That isn't a bug, it is a feature.  Apache opens all access
and error logs at startup.  I think you will find that you
are running into some other limit.  There is really nothing
Apache can do about it; you need to follow the advice in the
FAQ and either reduce the number of descriptors used or
increase the number available.
