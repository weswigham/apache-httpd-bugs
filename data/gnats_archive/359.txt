>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1, latest patchs. GCC 2.7.2.2, x86...
>Description:
Implemented to replace CERN proxy. Over time, proxy stability kept decreasing. More and more
proxy requests were refused, or hung for no particular reason. Problems were not observed until
maximum cache file size was reached.

Factors:
	Lots of spare memory, lots of spare disk, lots of spare CPU. 
	It simply worked less and less often over time. Before removing it,
	I was consistently able to fail every other request, some to systems 
	right down the hall...
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm not sure, given this is a production environment, I don't have time to test it 
a lot. It worked perfectly fine when only the IT department used it, but when we
rolled it out for general use, it just stopped working eventually.

More than 500 users, 20-30 concurrent, 5 remote WAN sites is our environment.
We had 250K proxy hits in the two weeks it was up.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you send us the configuration files you were using for
the proxy? That may help us analyze things.
