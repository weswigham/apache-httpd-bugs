It's actually on www.apache.org; printenv.cgi shows it.
>Description:
Compare

http://www.apache.org/printenv.cgi/path/info
http://www.apache.org/printenv.cgi/path%2Finfo

These should both call printenv.cgi, right?  The second case results in
"file not found", apparently because the server is looking for the file
/printenv.cgi/path/info .

Related to this, PATH_INFO is being un-URL-encoded before being passed to the
script, e.g.

http://www.apache.org/printenv.cgi/path%20info

results in PATH_INFO of "/path info".  Shouldn't it be passed along without
decoding it, i.e. "/path%20info"?  Otherwise, how could a script distinguish
between PATH_INFOs of "/path%2Finfo" and "/path/info"?  Or are such pairs
always semantically equivalent?

Sticky question and a can of worms, I know.  When are parts of the URL
encoded and when aren't they, etc.  The latest CGI draft seems to imply
that PATH_INFO treatment may vary by server (section 6.1.6), but this
results in non-portable scripts.  Granted, the CGI draft is a BCP.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try http://www.apache.org/printenv.cgi/path%2Finfo
>Fix:
What seems to be lacking is a clear definition of when things are encoded and 
when they aren't.  I know that's very tricky to come up with.  Yes, I've lost
sleep trying to figure this one out.
