>Description:
As documented in PR 370, SetEnv doesn't set the PATH variable.  I would have liked
to simply add this note to PR 370, but your interface has no way to do that.

I think this bug should be fixed.  It was first reported in 1997.  It is annoying
to have to recompile apache, or else hack the (several) scripts which possibly
start apache, just to set a decent default path.  I want my apache configuration
to be as self-contained as possible, so (e.g.) I can move it to another machine
without having to remember to hack this or that system script.

<rant>
If the apache team does not want to fix this, can it at least be documented
in mod_env's docs *which* environment variables have this problem?  It's very
annoying to spend 30 minutes of trial and error, and then web searching, only
to discover this is a known problem which no one bothered to document.
</rant>
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with mod_env (in by default) and say

  SetEnv PATH /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
>Fix:
Either make it take effect, or else print to the logs that it is being ignored,
and document that with mod_env.
