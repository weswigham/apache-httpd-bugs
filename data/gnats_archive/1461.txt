>Description:
My friends and I seem shy until you set us off.  Three so called ISPs have set us off.
We are the techno gang of Kiel.

We have three ISPs but they are all clueless.  We have Dotnet (fucknet), Digital Axis (Digital Asses), and Data Plus (just plain clueless).

We are so fed up with them that we have considered starting our own ISP.  I had my own BBS a year ago and am currently experimenting with ISP server software.

I downloaded Apache 1.3b3 for Win32.  It was an executable and did not include the source code.  There are a couple problems that don't let the webserver run.  I fixed a couple by moving files around because the problem had to do with invalid relative "links" to files.  If I had the source, I could fix the problem of it trying to go to a directory it thinks doesn't exist because it is already in it and see why it says that there is no /apache/conf/httpd.conf file even though it should find that one now.  If I had the source code, I could see if maybe it is loading it a second time and shouldn't be (the only thing I can think of right now).  I am actually learning C++ now and the source would also really help me out with giving me a better understanding of the language.  I should know enough to fix problems I encounter.  I would not be able to make any major changes though with out screwing it totally up though.  You are probably glad to hear that though. :)

One of your pages says you have the source in a zip file but I can not find that file.  If you could, please e-mail it to me.

I have Linux on a CD but never installed it.  Bill has some understanding of Unix so we should learn quickly if you suggest we set one of the systems up that way.  We do not fear crashes.  A crashed system is the sign of a true computer enthusiest, or a total idiot.

*My girl friend is running for Mayor.  If we don't get our ISP started, maybe she can shape up the three ISPs we have if she gets elected.
