Linux amp 2.0.36 #2 Sun Feb 21 15:55:27 EST 1999 i586 unknown
>Description:
Before v1.3.6, MultiViews was useful for leaving the file extension off a filename in a URL, to simplify the URL or disguise the file's type. It has actually been used widely for this purpose.

With 1.3.6, MultiViews cannot be enabled while inhibiting use of the "Content-Location", "TCN", and "Vary" MIME entries to mimic the behavior of 1.3.4 and previous versions. Modern browsers do not cache pages that are returned with these entries found in the MIME header.

It may be a good feature to allow file extensions to be omitted, separately from content negotiation, per directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.dixielink.com/ can be cached
http://www.dixielink.com/index cannot be cached
http://www.dixielink.com/index.html can be cached
>Fix:
Content negotiation could be made optional instead of a feature required in MultiViews.

 Update:
 
 Apache 1.3.9 has a fix for this problem, at least for Internet Explorer
 4.x. Enabling "force-no-vary" keeps IE4 from choking on the Vary header,
 so now pages are cached.
 
 Using "Header unset Vary" and "Header unset TCN" does not work, because
 these are added after the "Header" directives are processed.
 
 Still would like to see no content negotiation when only one file can be
 retrieved, or a way to configure Apache to allow for an extension to be
 left off without using MultiViews.
