>Description:
Apache/1.3.9 (Win32) ApacheJServ/1.1b3:

Since ApacheJServ 1.1beta3 is installed the apache "restart" gives a crash. 
No error messages to be found in apache or jserv logs.

So, I try to run:
E:\Programs\ApacheGr\Apache\Apache.exe -k restart


>How-To-Repeat:
run:  Apache.exe -k restart

If it is not repeatable it is obviously not a problem; 
I send this report because I experienced it on two 
separate NT4 machines.
>Fix:
no

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:28:41 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/

The JServ 1.1.2 is the recommended version for that package.
