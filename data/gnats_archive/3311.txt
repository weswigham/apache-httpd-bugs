State-Changed-Why:
The version of Apache that you cite does not exist.
What version are you running? Do you have to
authenticate twice for a single page request or is this
happening for two different HTTP requests.

Please try to duplicate your problem on the most recent version
of the Apache server (1.3.3), using the canonical host name
of the web server, on a page with no embedded images or
applets which would cause additional HTTP requests. This will
help lead to the specific problem.

This is almost certainly not an Apache bug, though.
