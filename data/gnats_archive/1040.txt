>Environment:
Linux 1.2.20 (and sparc-solaris), doesn't matter.
>Description:
All the documents in our server are located *under* the URL
http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/math/
(that is, all our documents are prefixed by math), because we are part of
a network of servers, and we own the "math"-part of the server. So, if
we get a request for the root document
http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/
we cannot serve it, rather we must redirect this request to the master http
server. Until now, we used the CERN server for this using the directive
redirect / http://www.uni-muenster.de/
This does not work with apache, because it assumes that the fake URL (the
first argument of redirect) is always the beginning of a path, so if we
use the above directive, /whatever will be redirected to
http://www.uni-muenster.de/whatever and we will never get a chance to serve
one single document. (Actually, I'd really like to redirect "Everything
but /math" to our master server).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Don't know. There should be a way of specifying that the fake path
is to be taken literally, probably by adding a $-sign to the path

Please use mod_rewrite for this purpose.
See the manual for configuration details.

(In Apache 1.3 mod_alias will support regular expressions.)
