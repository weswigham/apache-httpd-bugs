>Description:

SSI generates garbage in 2.0 alpha 7... some text is
displayed but it's all mangled.

Yes, I know this is being discussed on new-httpd, but
wanted to let others know it is an issue under 2.0a7
if you have downloaded it.

>How-To-Repeat:

Create an SSI page with SSI directives and try to load 
it from the browser.

>Fix:

No, but I understand rbb is fast at work on this, and
it should be working under 2.0a8 when that is released.

Mod_include works again.  This will be available in the next
Apache 2.0 alpha or beta.
