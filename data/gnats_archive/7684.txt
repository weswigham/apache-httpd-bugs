Linux mips 2.2.18 #4 Mon Mar 19 11:18:58 PST 2001 i686 unknown
slackware 7.0
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
>Description:
my config file looks like this:
<IfModule prefork.c>
StartServers         2
MinSpareServers      1
MaxSpareServers      2
MaxClients          10
MaxRequestsPerChild  0
</IfModule>

when i start up apache, and do ps, i see 3 httpd processes.
after one request, there are 25 httpd processes and it stays that way until i kill them.
>How-To-Repeat:
reproduce this problem by building a prefork apache and configuring the server
in a similar fashion that i have (with low numbers of processes), start the server and make a request.

State-Changed-Why:
I have been unable to reproduce this.  Are you sure that 
there are no other prefork sections in your config file?

Is there anything in your error log?  Is this reproducable?
