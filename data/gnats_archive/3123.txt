I've a strange problem with a CGI-script.
The script works correctly together with Netscape but
returns "Premature end of script headers" when used with IE3.
It looks like IE3 closes the connection prematurely or like that.
The CGI-script receives a SIGTERM, and I assume it comes from Apache.
Is this a problem with IE3 or Apache?

 This is almost certainly your CGI being broken.  As we state quite
 clearly, this isn't the place for debugging problems with your CGI.
 
 What does this CGI do?  Does it check what browser is being used for
 anything?  Can you run a simple CGI like test-cgi that is included with
 Apache?

If the problem was really APache the user would have
reported back by now, and others would have reported the
problem also.

Thanks for using Apache
