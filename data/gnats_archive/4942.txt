>Description:

I get a lot of entries in the error_log such as:

[Wed Sep  1 00:35:01 1999] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[Wed Sep  1 00:35:09 1999] [crit] (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to port 80
[Wed Sep  1 00:35:09 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Wed Sep  1 00:50:01 1999] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[Wed Sep  1 00:50:10 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Wed Sep  1 00:50:10 1999] [crit] (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to port 80

I was getting these under 3.0.6, with PHP 4 beta and figured perhaps
I should upgrade to 3.0.9.  The problem persisted.  Then, I decided
to downgrade PHP to a stable release (4 is still beta).  The problem
still persisted.  IS this really a problem, or am I losing my mind?

Thanks...
