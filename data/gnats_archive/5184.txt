It does not matter realy...
>Description:
The environment variable SCRIPT_FILENAME does not include the negotiated 
ending (for example .en.php3) if used together with ScriptAlias to call
a CGI parsing that file and if the ScriptAlias is not pointing to a real file
in the filesystem.

Ok, surely confusing... Here some details:

I use a cgiwrapper (from http://ftp.umr.edu/pub/cgi/cgiwrap/) to wrap CGI scripts.
This wrapper works without problems.

If I put CGI scripts for different languages, it does call the cgi script (e.g.
it does find the correct script), put does not provide the correct 
SCRIPT_FILENAME.

But this SCRIPT_FILENAME is important if I wan't to use PHP in CGI mode...
Without that, PHP works not in CGI mode with MultiViews.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a simple CGI-Skript, for example:

------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

while (($key, $val) = each %ENV) {
        print "$key = $val<BR>\n";
}
---------------------------

Store that Skript as 'printenv.en.wrap' and 'printenv.de.wrap' on a apache
server.

Get cgiwrap from http://ftp.umr.edu/pub/cgi/cgiwrap/ and compile it:
./configure --with-perl=/usr/bin/perl --with-httpd-user=wwwrun --with-cgi-dir=cgi-bin
cp cgiwrap /somewhere/wrapper/ ; chown 0.0 /somewhere/wrapper/cgiwrap ; chmod 4111 /somewhere/wrapper/cgiwrap

Configure apache:
Options ... MultiViews
AddHandler cgi-script-w .wrap
Action cgi-script-w /cgi-bin/
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /somewhere/wrapper/cgiwrap/user/

Call the printenv cgi: http://server/path/printenv

You will see the output of printenv, put no environment variable includes
the complete file name (e.g. printenv.en.wrap or printenv.de.wrap)

This file name in the Environment is needed for PHP to read the file....
>Fix:
Setting the SCRIPT_FILENAME to the real file name in all cases.

Remember, it is set if the internal cgi mechanism is used or if the php 
executable is used directly in the above Action statement.
