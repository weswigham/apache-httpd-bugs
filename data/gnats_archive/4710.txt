Hello to all specialists

I have a Problem with together MySQL, PHP3 and Apache-Server on Windows95.

I run Apache-Server as Webserver , also on this machine runbs MySQLWIN32.

<html>
<Title>Datenbanktest</title>
<head>
<a>Datenbank wird erzeugt...</a><br>
</head>

<body>

<!--Datenbank erstellen-->
<?
     mysql_connect("localhost", "username") ;
    @mysql_select_db("databasename");
    
    $create = "CREATE TABLE test
     	       (
          		 Name                 CHAR(50),
          		)";
    
    MYSQL_QUERY($create);
   
   
    mysql_close();
?>

<a>Fertig.</a>
</body>

</html>

if let it run I get an errormessage as follows:

This really has little to do with Apache; there isn't much
we can do to help you.  This is a PHP and mysql question.
There is nothing to indicate that Apache is doing anything
wrong...
