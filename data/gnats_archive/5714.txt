>Description:
I have upgraded Apache from version 1.3.6 to 1.3.11.

However one of my .htaccess Rules is no longer working. Here is the content of the .htaccess file:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /cgi-bin
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !81
RewriteRule (.+)$ http://www.esosoft.net:81/cgi-bin/$1 [P]

It simply passes every request to the server on port 81 via the proxy
and retuns the results.

It works just fine with URLs without a ?, but as soon as
it has to serve a request like: review?id=1376, the proxy
server gets the following request: review%3Fid=1376?id=1376 and obviously
returns a 404 error as it could not find the script...

Do you know what I have to change in my rules or if its a bug? As I haven't changed anything to the rules.....

Thank you

Michael

 I found a way to repeat this problem and a work around, though I think
 it should be solved too.
 
 The problem can be repeated, at least with version 1.3.20, by disabling
 the sharing of mod_proxy and allow the sharing of mod_rewrite. I had to
 do this because on the Sun Sparc Solaris 7 the shared version of
 mod_proxy complained about an unknown variable or something like that.
 I could repeat the problem on Linux RH 7.0 with 2.4.4 kernel.
 
 By disabling the sharing of mod_rewrite, the problem was solved. And by
 allowing the sharing of mod_proxy and mod_rewrite (which didn't work on
 the SUN).
 
 So: the workaround is to disable sharing for both modules or use sharing
 for both.
 
 Good luck
