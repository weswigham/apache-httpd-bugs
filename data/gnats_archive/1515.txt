Below is the output from the Configuration command and the compiler errors.

Output from Configure -- 

Using config file: Configuration
Using Makefile template file: Makefile.tmpl

 + setting C compiler to cc
 + setting C compiler optimization-level to

Output from Make -- Only change to the Makefile that I made was changing

CC=cc    to     CC=CC

I don't have gcc, I am using my C++ compiler which is version 3.01

 Apache is a C program not a C++ program... C allows such assignments.
 Feel free to add a cast to get it to compile though.  You might
 want to build gcc using your C++ compiler, I think that works.

State-Changed-Why:
As Dean said, Apache is a C program and a C++ compiler
will often not work.

gcc would probably be your best bet.
