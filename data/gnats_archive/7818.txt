 In response to your apache issue, I think you should obtain a new copy 
 of the installation.  I feel this is likely a download corruption issue.
 
 If you try this without results, please reply including more information 
 about your installation, such as the location of the .msi file when you 
 run it, and the path you are installing too.
 
 Thanks,
 Ryan Fox
