Windows 98 SE, 333 mhz Pentium II, 96 SDRAM
>Description:
When ever I run a perl CGI, the name of Apache changes from "APACHE" to "perl."  Altohugh this is not a major problem, it is something that will need to be fixed eventually.  I hope this helped!  Plus, I really like Apache... keep up the GREAT work!!!!
>How-To-Repeat:
It's local to my PC... you'd have to do it to yours
>Fix:
No... sorry!!!

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 16 18:54:19 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

This is the behavior of the command shell environment, not
the Apache server.  Unfortunately, there is very little we
can do to affect the console pseudo-window (which the OS
owns and controls.)

Thank you for your report and interest in the Apache Project!
