>Description:
A test script runs fine from the command line, but run through apache returns a page saying "no input selected"

The error file says "(8)Exec format error" very similar to bug 1621, except my #! line doesn't point to another script, it points to my php binary.

I'm using PHP as a CGI script, i.e. no mod_php module, (despite some beliefs, this can be done, my hosting company does it, I'm trying to mirror this at home). I have the php extension type defined as cgi-script in srm.conf.

I do get a SIGINT, and the backtrace is as follows:
Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt
 0x4010fcf2 in __libc_accept ()

 rtld_fini=0x4000a350<_dl_fini, stack_end=0xbffffd3c)
 at ../sysdeps/generic/libc-start.c:78

>How-To-Repeat:
The script is a simple <?php echo "test"; ?> (with opening and closing html and body tags). The exact same script will execute on my hosting companies server correctly.

 All that information was provided in my report. It was
 a small test script, which was included in the report
 along with exact returns when it didn't work.

 It's a test script, and contains only the following:
 <?php echo "test"; ?>
 
 Plus the appropriate HTML and BODY tags.
 
 > What is the exact line in the error log?
 
 (8)Exec format error on excution of test.php3

 I run it with the command ./test.php3
 It outputs "test."
