>Organization:
>Environment:
The search.apache.org server, actually, as of today (13th of October)
>Description:
An HTTP/1.1 POST to the search.apache.org resulted in a 200 response as follows:

"HTTP/1.1 200" <CRLF>

The problem is that according to the spec (rfc 2616, section 6.1):
status-line = http-version SP status-code SP reason-phrase CRLF
reason-phrase in turn is defined *<TEXT, excluding CR, LF>. I take this to mean that the second SP is absolutely required. This is very similar to problem 150, reported for Apache 1.1.1 in the bug database.
>How-To-Repeat:
See the full description
>Fix:
Ensure that there is always a space after the status-code, even if the reason-phrase is empty.

State-Changed-Why:
This appears to have been fixed.  The problem was not
actually with Apache, it was with the search engine
we were using.  Upgrading to a new search engine seems
to have solved this problem.

Thank you for the bug report.
