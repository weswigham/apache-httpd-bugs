Bug report 3784 looks like it is another symptom of the same problem.

Although apache itself is running with group www as specified with a
group directive in the config file, CGI programs seem to run as the group
that was in effect when the server was launched.

I'm seeing this with mod_fcgi programs, but I suspect that this is not
the only module with this issue.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure apache with a group directive, set your group to another gid, and
start apache.  Use ps to examine the gid of the running processes.  This is
particularly simple with mod_fcgi since the fcgi programs stay running after
the current request is done.
>Fix:
I can just set my group id before starting apache, but this is just a
workaround, not a fix.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... please do more than "suspect" it happens with non
fastcgi programs.  It is entirely possible that what you are
seeing is a fastcgi bug, in which case we can do nothing about
it.

Also try using a current version of Apache.

 I've done a bit more research, and the problem is with mod_fastcgi, and there
 is no problem with mod_cgi.  I found a reference to the problem on a FastCGI
 site, so this is not an apache bug.
 
 A description of the actual problem can be found at:

 Thanks,
