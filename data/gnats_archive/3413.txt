Solaris 2.6 , gcc 2.8.1, gnu ld 2.9.1, mod_perl 1.16, perl 5.00502
>Description:
I get the error:
% /usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start
Syntax error on line 56 of /usr/local/apache/etc/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/libperl.so into server: ld.so.1: /usr/local/apache/sbin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /usr/local/apache/libexec/libperl.so: symbol main: referenced symbol not found
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started
% 
When I try to start apache with mod_perl.  I initially could not get any module
to load (see PR#3291), so I reconfiged with:
./configure \
        --localstatedir=/var \
        --runtimedir=/var/run/apache \
        --logfiledir=/var/log/apache \
        --proxycachedir=/var/cache/apache \
        --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
        --enable-module=most \
        --enable-shared=max \
        --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
        --enable-shared=perl
So this allowed all the rest of the modules to load, but there are still problems
with mod_perl.

Note that I am using gcc, not the sun compiler.  I had the same problem as in
PR#3291 even with gcc.  Perhaps these are related?
>How-To-Repeat:
Build on a solaris 2.6 system per the above.  Apache won't even start.
>Fix:
Staticly link in mod_perl?  How?  (I tried "-enable-dodule=perl" to avail.)
