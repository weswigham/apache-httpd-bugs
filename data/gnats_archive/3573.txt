>Description:
In src/main/http_config.c the following path would help me a lot
to make my error messages look right. 
 
The issue is the following: I'm implementing and testing a macro
processing module for apache. As I could not undertand all implicit
subtilities in cmd_parms, and in order to make macros as soft and general
as possible, I update gracefully the config_file of cmd_parms when 
macros are encountered and expanded. In order to have error message,
I kind of update the name field to "in macro this defined there and used
there else" but the new name is ignored on syntax error, and the message
is wrong. 
 
With the following patch it is not ignored anymore. It uses the new name
instead of the cached fname, and error messages are okay to me. It does
not change anything to apache since it is usually the same pointer.

State-Changed-When: Mon Dec 28 04:32:30 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Your proposal was taken into http_config.c as of rev. 1.138;
I see no ill side effects, and I think modules can take
advantage of the added flexibility of modifying the file name.
