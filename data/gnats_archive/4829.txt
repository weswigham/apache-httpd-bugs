>Description:

The httpdctl script inherits the path from whomever ran it (usually root).  
Sometimes this is undesirable for various reasons and a minimalistic 
configuration should have an option to configure the PATH.  A common path
might be something like PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin, but I'm not
going to make any specific recommendations as I suspect that there are other
people with much stronger opinions there :)

State-Changed-When: Thu May 25 10:19:24 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
This httpsdctl is not a file in the base Apache package.
It must be a third-party item.  We cannot change what isn't
ours..
