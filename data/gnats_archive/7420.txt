>Description:
would it be possible to allow 'LogFormat' for error_log and not just access_log?

we would like to see the referer for all the 404 errors recorded in a nice easy
way.

State-Changed-Why:

Apache 2.0 does report the referer on these errors.

However, the best way to handle this is to add the necessary
information to a CustomLog, and then just post-process
this log file to extract all the 404 errors (given by
the reponse status code) and examine the referer.

Thanks for using Apache!
