State-Changed-Why:
You don't really provide enough details to reproduce the
problem; it works fine for me.

It appears like your CGI script is sending out a redirect
to a different URL.  Some clients incorrectly use GET
when they get a redirect to a POST, some use POST.  It
sounds like you have a client that sends a POST with
no body.  This is not related to Apache.  If you need
help, you would be best posting somewhere like the
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi newsgroup.
