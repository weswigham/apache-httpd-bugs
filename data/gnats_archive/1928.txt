SunOS 4.1.4
gcc version 2.6.0
>Description:
Refer to test case below.
Variables set in nested SSI stream are not available to the outer layer
when the nesting is a result of a cgi.
This was not the case in 1.2b7
>How-To-Repeat:
SSI doc with <!--#set var="layer1" value=1>
    <!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/test1" -->
    <!--#printenv -->
cgi-bin/test1 outputs "Location: /layer2.htm\n\n"
/layer2.htm contains <!--#set var="layer2" value="2" -->
    <!--#printenv -->
>Fix:
Defer SSI processing of substreams until included in the final stream

State-Changed-Why:
That is correct, and it won't be fixed.  Consider it to be
the same as using "source" in a shell script -- if you use source
it can modify the environment.  If you execute another program it
can't modify the environment.  mod_include was doing very questionable
things to implement this undocumented feature.
