>Description:

I am seeing a problem with clients who are using IE 5.5 and Windows 98.  When they try to access a mod_auth protected page, they instantly get the 401 ErrorDocument, and are never prompted for a Username and Password.  Looking in the access_log shows the following:

(client instantly fails)
65.27.32.16 - - [15/Apr/2001:21:20:23 -0400] "GET /news HTTP/1.0" 401 2316 "http://www.newsranger.com" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatibl
e; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98)"
65.27.32.16 - - [15/Apr/2001:21:20:24 -0400] "GET /images/logo.jpg HTTP/1.0" 304 - "http://www.newsranger.com/news" "Mozilla/4
.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98)"
65.27.32.16 - - [15/Apr/2001:21:20:24 -0400] "GET /images/submit.jpg HTTP/1.0" 304 - "http://www.newsranger.com/news" "Mozilla
/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98)"

All client patches are installed on the PC.  HTTP/1.1 is turned off in IE.  Have also tried adding this to httpd.conf with no luck:
BrowserMatch "MSIE 5\." downgrade-1.0 nokeepalive force-no-vary

I have snoop output if it is needed to analyze this problem.

>How-To-Repeat:

Using IE 5.5 and Windows 98, go to http://www.newsranger.com/news
401 ErrorDocument is instantly displayed.
>Fix:

Clients can use any other browser (including Mozilla 6) and it works 100% fine.

State-Changed-Why:
It works fine for me with IE that identifies itself as IE 5.50.4522.1800 on W2K.  I don't see anything wrong in the output the server is sending, so it could be some wacky client bug.

Please send the snoop output and I can double check the server isn't doing anything wrong.

 I would certainly guess this is an IE 5.5 specific bug, but maybe=20
 it's something apache can handle better?  I would have never=20
 reported this, but I have seen so many clients report the same=20
 exact problem.  Here is the URL to snoop output and our access_log:

 Here is some more information on the specific client version:
 
 Help->About Internet Explorer:
 Version: Customized:5.50.4522.1800C
 Update-Versions:SP1;Q279328;Q286045;
 
 Alsom going directly to a password protected file yields the same =
 result, i.e.
 going to http://www.newsranger.com/news/index.html gives the same 401
 as going to http://www.newsranger.com/news

 Another client version:

State-Changed-When: Mon Apr 23 11:40:42 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
I can see no problems in the response that Apache is generating in the given snoop output, so this is almost certainly some client bug; there is no obvious way to work around it without knowing what type of crack IE is on, so I'm afraid we can't do much.

The only random suggestion I have is to try removing the http-equiv meta tags in your HTML, especially the charset one.
