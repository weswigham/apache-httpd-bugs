>Description:
http_main.c:1501 default_server_hostnames():

This bit of code results in Apache attempting to resolve a declaration
of the form <VirtualHost 10.0.0.1> into a hostname.

                h = gethostbyaddr ((char *)&(s->addrs->host_addr),
                                   sizeof (struct in_addr), AF_INET);
                if (h != NULL)
                    s->server_hostname = pstrdup (pconf, (char *)h->h_name);
                else
                    {
                    fprintf(stderr,"Failed to resolve server name for %s (check
DNS)\n",inet_ntoa(s->addrs->host_addr));
                    exit(0);
                    }

This is a problem - firstly because the whole point of using an ip address
is to workaround possible unavailability or removal of dns outside one's
control. Also, it prevents another section of code (namely being able
to use <VirtualHost 255.255.255.255> as a default section) from working
because that doesn't typically have any dns- one can work around in /etc/hosts
but that's not good for performance reasons.

There's an additional issue with logging - %v in mod_log_config uses
r->server->server_hostname rather than, say, r->hostname if there
was no Host header. Possibly this should be dealt with by an alternative 
value in LogFormat, as someone might want to choose which form they want.
>How-To-Repeat:
Define a virtualhost section with an IP address that has no reverse dns.
Try and restart Apache (or reconfigure with a SIGHUP):

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.2>
DocumentRoot /docs
</VirtualHost>

gives "Failed to resolve server name for 127.0.0.2 (check DNS)"

>Fix:
Remove the lookup altogether. It's bogus. Get s->server_hostname from the
ServerName declaration, if required.

 Not really.  That was about it not starting and saying it should skip
 them; that is a valid request.  This one is mostly saying Apache doesn't
 need the hostname, which is entirely false; HTTP/1.1 and non-IP virtual
 hosts require that Apache know the hostname.  As I told the user on
 c.i.w.s.u, if you don't want Apache to insist on reverse DNS use a
 ServerName directive to tell it what to use.
 
 Haven't had time to look at what is being said about the logging yet.  On
 the surface, this just looks to be a feature request; I am unsure about if
 that is a good idea because it obscures what configured virutal domain a
 request was for, but may be ok as a seperate variable.  Not before 1.2 in
 any case.

 pr#150 is talking about forward resolution of virtualhost declarations
 (probably why i didn't find it in a search before submitting). His
 suggestion is to ignore that declaration and log it in error_log.
 
 my pr is about reverse lookups. The bit of code I quoted makes
 apache lookup the forward name for the ip address: this seemed
 like a bad idea to me.

 hm, you're saying that it won't enter that bit of code if I put
 a ServerName directive? But that certainly isn't obvious, and as
 I was experimenting with the <virtualhost 255.255.255.255> default
 thing, a servername doesn't seem like something one needs.

 That's what I shall do, for myself. (I'm actually trying to genericise
 things, as holding many VirtualHost config entries and searching
 through them when they're all practically identical doesn't seem)
 
 It sounds like a good fix for the situation of no reverse dns lookup
 would be to change the error message to suggest adding a ServerName
 directive.
