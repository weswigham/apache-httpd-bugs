Microsof Windows NT Server 4.00.1381 (3 Service Pack)
>Description:
As a home page access Counter I am using Counter created by Muhammad A Muquit. (http://www.fccc.edu/users/muquit/)

It works fine with Apache/1.3b6. When I change to Apache/1.3b7 <Win 32>, the counter responses with string "Empty QUREY_STRING" instead of numbers expected.

After re-installing Apache/1.3b6, Counter responds as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use Counter.exe under Apache/1.3b7 <Win 32>.
