WinNT SP 4, precompiled Apache exe.
>Description:
1) Upload a file to the sever:
<form action="/cgi-bin/cgitest" method=post enctype="multipart/form-data"><p>
File upload:
<input type=file name=FileUpload value="some file">
<input type=reset>
<input type=submit>
</p></form>

In a CGI, I read through stdin the uploaded file, but:
1) All CRLF have been replaced by LF
2) CONTENT_LENGTH = the length when CR were still there, but
when reading fom stdin they are no more there and I can read
less bytes than excpected

CGI code snippet:

      const long data_size = atol(content_length.c_str());
      char * const buf = new char [data_size+1];
      const size_t read = fread(buf, 1, data_size, stdin);
>How-To-Repeat:
Upload a file with CRLF (POST HTTP method) and read it
through stdin in a CGI. CR have been removed (bad) and
CONTENT_LENGTH has not been changed (badbad).
>Fix:
No suggestions, but keep on the good work.
I hope my report is good enough.
Do not hesitate to ask me for more informations!

 Problem solved, sorry for for inconvenience.
 Maybe it should be a FAQ for the Windows port.
 Here are some explanations from MS doc:
 
 "The stdin, stdout, and stderr streams always
 open in text mode by default;"
 
 "t
 
 Open in text (translated) mode; carriage return-linefeed (CR-LF)
 combinations are translated into single linefeed (LF) characters on input;
 LF characters are translated to CR-LF combinations on output. Also, CTRL+Z
 is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input. In files opened for
 reading or for writing and reading with "a+", the run-time library checks
 for a CTRL+Z at the end of the file and removes it, if possible. This is
 done because using fseek and ftell to move within a file may cause fseek to
 behave improperly near the end of the file. The t option is a Microsoft
 extension that should not be used where ANSI portability is desired.
 
 b
 
 Open in binary (untranslated) mode; the above translations are suppressed."
 
 "The _setmode function sets to mode the translation mode of the file given
 by handle. The mode must be one of two manifest constants, _O_TEXT or
 _O_BINARY. _O_TEXT sets text (translated) mode. Carriage return-linefeed
 (CR-LF) combinations are translated into a single linefeed character on
 input. Linefeed characters are translated into CR-LF combinations on output.
 _O_BINARY sets binary (untranslated) mode, in which these translations are
 suppressed."
 
 "
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <fcntl.h>
 #include <io.h>
 
 main()
 {
    /* Set "stdin" to have binary mode: */
    _setmode( _fileno( stdin ), _O_BINARY );
 }"
