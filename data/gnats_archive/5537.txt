>Description:
this is strange.
I'm in a (Name)VH (I don't know if it's important)
I have the FS structure

/docroot/rep1/rep2/.htaccess

In this .htaccess I have
+----
|AuthName "Compte webinside"
|AuthType Basic
|PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthenDBI
|PerlSetVar Auth_DBI_data_source   dbi:mysql:webinside
|PerlSetVar Auth_DBI_username      apache
|PerlSetVar Auth_DBI_password      ***
|PerlSetVar Auth_DBI_pwd_table     user
|PerlSetVar Auth_DBI_uid_field     username
|PerlSetVar Auth_DBI_pwd_field     password
|require user toto
+-----

in the httpd.conf :
DirectoryIndex <files neither in rep1 nor rep2> 

when I access to *rep1*, I obtain "document contain no data". The other
directory, including rep2, and files are OK.

but : 
- If I put in the requirement 'valid-user', it's ok
- If I turn *off* the fancy Indexing, It's ok.

I obtain in the log (AuthenDBI) "Apache::AuthenDBI request type ="
>How-To-Repeat:
become as doom/idiot as I am :(
or look at the full description above.

---
when configured try (sorry this host is not accessible)
$ telnet webinside.esiea-ouest.fr 80
GET /webinside.esiea-ouest.fr/ HTTP/1.0
Host: webinside.esiea-ouest.fr

Connection closed by foreign host.
>Fix:
Suppress the nafty Fancy Indexing ;-))
If I may help ?
