State-Changed-Why:
Are you saying that if you hard-code TAB characters into
the format string of a CustomLog directive, they get
ignored or changed somehow?  You should be able to put
any printable character into the format string, and
possibly even C-standard escaped characters (e.g.,
"\007" for a BEL).  [I haven't verified this last
behaviour, but I would expect it to work.]
