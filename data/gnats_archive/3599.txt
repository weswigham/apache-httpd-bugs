>Description:
Apache is being used with Cold Fusion to server a high traffic commerce
site.  This site easily saturates a T1 line with traffic.  We started
using apache over Netscape Enterprise 3.5.1 for performance reasons.
I originally configed apache with MaxRequestsPerChild set to 300000.
Apache hung when it hit about 30000.  I set MaxRequestsPerChild to 0
and the apache worked fine for about a day and a half.  It never totaly
hung but most people got a 'server too busy' response.  Stop and
start the apache process and everything was fine.

I saw a bugreport about the MaxRequestsPerChild.  I only mentioned
it becuase the server hang for the MaxRequestsPerChild is exactly
the same as the hang over extended use.

 Oops, I actually have 1.3.3 installed.  I don't know

 Although this might have everything to do with Solaris libraries, rather
 than Cold Fusion; I:ve ran into much the same on Solaris 2.5 around the
 10k requests per single child. (Solaris was for us about three times as
 fast, on the same hardware) It clearly is not a memory leak; and running
 it with truss revealed it whas in the ODBC of the cold fusion module.
 Lowering
 the MaxRequestsPerChild to 2k 'solved' the issue. Interesting to note; it
 only
 seemed to be the number of request, not the load, or the time in which it
 happened
 and only when ODBC was involved. The move to solaris caused such a low
 MaxRequestsPerChild not to have any noticable impact
 
 Are you sure that on NT there is such an impact to warrant a high max
 request
 per child, it is there exactly to prevent this sort of resource hog hangs ?

 We have Apache running on another server that is not using CF
 nearly as much and we never have a problem with that site.
 I tried setting MaxRequestsPerChild to 5000.  It ran for
 about 20 minutes before restarting itself.  In the next 10
 minutes after that the server became busy and received
 5000 access in about 10 minutes.  Apache hung while servicing
 98 request (150 max) and had 5100 total access.  I waited
 about 2 minutes for the process to restart itself and it
 never did.  I stopped and started the process manually.
 
 I tried setting it to 2000 as you suggested and Apache just
 hung faster while servicing about the same load.  I set
 MaxRequestsPerChild back to 0 so it will at least run longer
 before hanging.  I have Apache and CF stop and start at
 0300 every day to prevent problems.  It still hangs at
 least once a day in its current configuration.  
 
 I'm fairly certain that Apache hangs because we are using
 CF.  I need to know whether it is something I can nag Allaire
 about or if it is something that can be fixed on the Apache
 end.  I have a much better chance of keeping this site up
 if there is a modification I can make to Apache.

 Well, based (purely) on solaris, Ive got no 'truss' and 'lsof' on NT,
 we have the feeling that it is directly related to the cold fusion module
 and more specifically to the ODBC connection.
 
 One good check you could do is to use the separate cold fusion
 engine; i.e. the non module approach. This cgi application is completel
 separate from apache. If that one shows the same behaviour; you
 are one step further.

 Well, based (purely) on solaris, Ive got no 'truss' and 'lsof' on NT,
 we have the feeling that it is directly related to the cold fusion module
 and more specifically to the ODBC connection.
 
 One good check you could do is to use the separate cold fusion
 engine; i.e. the non module approach. This cgi application is completel
 separate from apache. If that one shows the same behaviour; you
 are one step further.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm afraid that ODBC drivers are often 'leaky', and even
starting and stopping processes may or may not clear up
the memory or resource leaks.

Please try the newest Apache versions, but at this moment
I'm afraid this is not an Apache issue.

One hint, try setting up the new 1.3.13 to be released RSN
and set up a job to apache -n servicename -k restart the
server every few hours.  Open connections will be served
as the child processes are torn down and new ones created.
