>Description:
when a servlet (like the SSI servlet) sets the Servlet-Error 
header value (to 404 lets say) that value is not propagated to the 
rest of apache (the status is always set to HTTP_OK).
>How-To-Repeat:
set your ErrorDocument directive to point to something.

type in a bogus filename (that ends in .html); that takes you to the errordocument

type in a bogus filename (that ends in .jhtml); you get the SSI servlets error document, even though it set the Servlet-Error to 404

 Hmm, it seems like it's a feature, not a bug.
 
     /* Check for our Error headers */
     if (header=ap_table_get(r->err_headers_out, "Servlet-Error")) {
         /* Backup the original status */
         int status=r->status;
 
         /* Close buffer and kill timeouts */
         ap_bclose(buffsocket);
         ap_kill_timeout(r);
 
         /* Log error to Apache logfile */
         jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_ERROR,cfg,"ajp12: Servlet Error:
 %s",header);
 
         /* Remove headers and return */
         ap_table_unset(r->err_headers_out, "Servlet-Error");
         r->status = HTTP_OK;
         r->status_line = NULL;
         return status;
     }
 
 First, servlet-error seem to be used only internally to pass error
 messages to be logged by apache. If somebody want's to set a custom
 status response, he (or she :-) should use setStatus() method which
 passes the status as normal status header. What we can only try to set
 here is 500 Internal Server Error in case of response having
 Servlet-Error set, instead of HTTP_OK.
