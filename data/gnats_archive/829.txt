>Description:
Like PR84:

Using SriptLog will eat up stderr if script returns ok ...
>How-To-Repeat:
#!/usr/bin/perl

# Create errror by commenting out this line
print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";

# Some regular output
print "Text in output\n";

# Error message
print stderr "This should appear in error-log\n";

State-Changed-Why:
