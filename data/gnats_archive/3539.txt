>Release:        1.3.3 for win32
>Environment:
NT server 4 , apache 1.3.3 , activestate perl win32 version 316
>Description:
I have installed the apache 1.3.3 at my nt4 server and it works very good. 
In the last few weeks I have used apache to run a cgi programe. The cgi programe will called every 2 to 3 seconds. 
In this cause I want to use the mod_perl to reduce the cpu usage of loading the perl32.
But I couldn't found any mod_perl that has complied with apache 1.3.3 win32 (the dll file).
I have tried to install the perlex1.1(from activestate which is similar to mod_perl), but it has problems to install it into the apache server(the installer dosen't recongize the apache server).

Please tell me if where I can find the mod_perl or similar things for apache/win32.

Sorry about the late response, december were busy for me.

You can find a precompiled mod_perl for win32 at:

 ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/plan/perl/CPAN/authors/id/JBAKER/

JBAKER provides an complete package with perl, mod_perl and apache and some nice modules at:
