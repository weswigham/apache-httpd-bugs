>Description:
It would be very helpfull if the same conventions that are used by mod_vhost_alias for Dynamic Virtual hosting, rewriting of the docroot and cgi-bin could be applied to access and error logs. 

I am looking for a way to implement this with mod_rewrite or something of that nature but have not been successful so far. The issue at hand is seperating out error and access logs for each virtualhost.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sat Apr 28 10:18:38 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
It is not practical for the regular logging directives to allow such logfiles because that would significantly change the semantics of how logging works; right now, logs are opened once and are opened before Apache setuid()s to the user it runs as.  These semantics are unlikely to change since they are there for various good reasons.

You could use the piped logging feature to have Apache send the access logs to an external program, which can then split them out however you want, without the code having to be internal to Apache.

 ok great makes complete sense. What about putting a referance to the
 split-logfile program in this document
 http://httpd.apache.org/docs/vhosts/mass.html I found that program to be
 most helpfull and only found it referanced in the FAQ.
