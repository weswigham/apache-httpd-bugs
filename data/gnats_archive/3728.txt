>Environment:
SunOS elbe 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/egcs-2.91.60/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release)
>Description:
Last time I checked, gcc without "-O" generated pretty poor code
on SPARC.  I suggest that the default compilation option be "-O".
Right now, it's the following (I worked-around by specifying "make CC='gcc -O'")

===> src/os/unix
gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DSOLARIS2=270 `../../apaci` os.c
gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DSOLARIS2=270 `../../apaci` os-inline.c
rm -f libos.a
ar cr libos.a os.o os-inline.o
ranlib libos.a
<=== src/os/unix
===> src/ap
gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=270 `../apaci` ap_execve.c
gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=270 `../apaci` ap_cpystrn.c
gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=270 `../apaci` ap_signal.c
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure
make

and you'll see this kind of output (at least on Solaris 7 / SPARC)
