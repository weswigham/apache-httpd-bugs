Win 2000, allready compiled package
>Description:
Our program publishes COM-component (singleton) as Local Server. So component is available only when program is runnig. Now we use this component from web page using python script (creates same singleton component, for communication purposes ) from this COM-server (our program). Everything works just fine, when we use script from apache started from console window. Python Script uses COM-component just fine. But when we use same script from apache started as service, we get error "Class Not registered", fast everything is similar than while using console window (only difference is that we started apache as service instead of starting it as console window).  We have added Rpcss to registry. We also tested this COM-component from another service (own) and all worked just fine -> cause of error is most likely the apache. Everything 
works also fine, if component is publisced as inproc, but then the main idea
of communication is wasted. We need component created as Local Server
>How-To-Repeat:
Create program that publish COM-component as local server and then try to
use it with some script page from apache. Our python script is like this:
import win32com.client 

print "Content-Type: text/html"
print 

ctx = pythoncom.CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER

o = win32com.client.Dispatch("ExternalQueryConnectorComponent.ExternalQueryConnector", clsctx=ctx )
s = str(o.externalXMLQuery("out Message inserted here"))

print s
>Fix:
No Idea. But script still works fine with console, so...
