>Description:
This is a followup to my "critical" bug report from this morning.  I was
mistaken.  ExecCGI does work as expected.  The problem is that Options
defaults to All if it is not mentioned in a <directory> section.  My server
had no <Directory> or <Location> sections for user-supported directories.  
Hence all ~username directories had ExecCGI turned on.

This seems to me to be a dangerous situation.  Shouldn't Options default to
"None"?  At the very least, there should be some warning in the documentation
about this, and a default <Location /~*> entry in access.conf-dist that establishes
conservative policies.

State-Changed-Why:

The default behaviour was inherited from NCSA httpd.

From a security point of view it should be changed, but
it would break lot of configs I think.

On the other hand the manual mentions this topic...
Our new set of .conf-dist files will include (AFAIK)
something like this:
 <Directory />
  AllowOverride None
  ...
  </Directory>
