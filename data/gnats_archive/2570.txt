>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1 (sun4m), GCC 2.7.2.2, with mod_frontpage (version 3.0.2.1330, microsoft's latest) compiled into apache
>Description:
When someone requests a sub-directory name without a trailing slash, apache normally sends a redirect to the same directory name but with a slash at the end. Our server is sending the redirect with the slash at the end, but translating the host name to "yosemite" (the machine's native DNS name is "yosemite.iag.net".)

Example: "http://fptest.iag.net/red" ("fptest.iag.net" is a <VirtualHost> on the machine, and "red" is a subdirectory in the docs tree) should generate a redirect to "http://fptest.iag.net/red/", instead it generates a redirect to "http://yosemite/red/" (it adds the slash which is good, but changes the host name which is bad.)
>How-To-Repeat:
http://fptest.iag.net/ (a testing site that i use) has a sample page with links to "red" and "red/". the "red" link generates a redirect to "http://yosemite/red/" when it should generate a link to "http://fptest.iag.net/red/".
>Fix:
not really- i had to add #include "compat.h" to the frontpage module to make it compile cleanly, the full source tree is intact and available if needed for debugging.

State-Changed-Why:
If it is sending the name, then it is getting it from
somewhere.  Either your system is configured to resolve
the IP to an unqualified name, or you are using an unqualified
name in your config.  You can work around the problem by
either adding a ServerName directive to the vhost with the
right name, or using "UseCanonicalName off" (see the docs
for details).
