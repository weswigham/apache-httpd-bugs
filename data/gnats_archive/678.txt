>Environment:
NetBSD 1.2E/pmax on a DECstation 3100.
Server compiled with gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
The PATH_TRANSLATED CGI variable is based on the server document root,
not the user's www directory when running a user's CGI program
under the user's www home
>How-To-Repeat:
http://server/~user/something.cgi, where something.cgi prints
the values of PATH_TRANSLATED
>Fix:
Make PATH_TRANSLATED for user CGI programs be set based on the
path to the user's www director

State-Changed-When: Sun Jun 22 22:26:36 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Please try again with 1.2, there were fixes in this area.

But at any rate, I just tried /~dgaudet/printenv/~dgaudet/foo and
it properly translated the path.  Which is correct.

Thanks for using Apache!
