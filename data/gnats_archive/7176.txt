>Description:
I am not getting a core dump, i am however executing apache via /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
during compilation i did --enable-module=(did all the modules) and i did --with-perl and of course
prefixed it to /usr/local/apache.

After it about 1 minute, the program becomes a zombie.  this problem started happening in 1.3.14, and continued to 
1.3.17.  It did not however occur in 1.3.12.


>How-To-Repeat:
As far as repeating this problem use LinuxPPC 2000, with the latest php4, and
compile apache how i described above, also (not that it makes a difference) 
have like 6 IP-vaed virtual hosts in the config. NOTE, No RPM's
everything is compiling from source.


>Fix:
I have no sugguestions on how to fix it, however do note there was not this problem in 1.3.12.
