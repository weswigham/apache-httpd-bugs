This could also be a doc-bug...
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_autoindex.html#adddescription

The syntax for AddDescription is as follows:
AddDescription string file [file] ...

"file" is defined as: "a file extension, partial filename, wild-card expression or full filename for files to describe"

However, using the directive as follows:

AddDescription "Hypertext Markup Language" html

so that a *directory* named "html" has that description, also applies that description to files that end with the extension .html --- which is a conflict the definition of "file" might predict. It seems as though "file" is actually treating everything as if it is surrounded by wildcards.

So that this is what I get:

 html/                   Hypertext Markup Language
 netscape_colors.html    Hypertext Markup Language
 special_characters.html Hypertext Markup Language

And this is what I want:
 html/                   Hypertext Markup Language
 netscape_colors.html    Color Palette
 special_characters.html Special HTML Characters



>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Based on the documentation:

The syntax for AddDescription is as follows:
AddDescription string file [file] ...

"file" is defined as: "a file extension, partial filename, wild-card expression or full filename for files to describe"

You should change the effect of the AddDescription directive so that
1) file extensions need a preceding "." 
2) partial filenames are no longer accepted (wildcards should take care of this)
2) full filenames are the default
