>Description:
It would be nice to have a directive like this:
Mirror http://www.mysite.org/ /mirrors/mysite/
Apache should then serve files from /mirrors/mysite instead of getting them 
from www.mysite.org. If a requested file cannot be found locally, it should be
looked for at the original site (if an Internet connection is available). 
So it can be seen like a permanent cache which isn't modified in any way by 
Apache.

This would make it possible to mirror some sites locally and access them in a 
network not permanently connected to the internet (without having to modify 
URLs in the HTML documents).

This is already possible with the ProxyPass directive
(or with mod_rewrite).
