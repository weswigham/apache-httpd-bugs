 When trying to access  /mailman the documentation here: http://ctservice.de/taker/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/http://www.sino21.com/manual/vhosts/mass.html#homepages 
 indicates that this should be a global ScriptAlias directory, but in fact 
 
 my log shows it tries to access it in the virtual directory
 [Wed Nov 29 12:36:23 2000] [error] [client 24.217.63.195] File does not exist: /
 www/www.raschnet.com/mailman
 
 This worked before i started using VirtualDocumentRoot and all the permissions are fine, it's just trying to access the wrong directory. The same thing happens with cgi-bin.  Is there any way I can fix this?
