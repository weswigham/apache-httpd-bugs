>Description:
The docs for Satisfy say that "all" is the default behavior.
In my experience, Satisfy all works only if explicitly specified,
so presumably it is not the default.

Of course, if the docs reflect the intention, then I guess it is a sw-bug.

State-Changed-Why:
Satisfy all _is_ the default and it does work.  You are probably
misunderstanding how the directive works, but since you don't
give any examples about why you think it is wrong... isn't much
we can do.
