>Description:
I am using Javasoft XML package xml.jar. When running a routine via JServ,
JServ raises an error; 
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: com/sun/xml/tree/ParentNode. 
        at org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.processRequest(Compiled Code)
        at org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.run(Compiled Code)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Compiled Code)

This is a private class which my code does not explicitly call. If I run the same
app on UNIX JVM (ie UNIX prompt and redirect to System.out...there is no error.
It seems that Apache tries to load all classes used. I suspect I call a class 
within the JAR file, which in turn calls the private class.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I suggest this is a set-up problem. I've checked FAQ, but I can't see this 
problem reported

State-Changed-Why:
Try putting the xml.jar class in your repositories classpath only. If that doesn't work, try putting it in the wrapper.classpath only. Don't put it into both classpaths. ;-)

Let me know how that goes.
