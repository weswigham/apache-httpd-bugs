>Description:
Where are the source files for Win32?  I .exe I downloaded contained the binaries.
The web page has instructions for compiling Apache for Win32 but the download doesn't contain the source.

Also, when running on Windows 95 (it runs great), it runs out of a DOS session.
How do I get it to run silently in the background, like Netscape's FastTrack server.

Thanks in advance.

State-Changed-When: Fri Nov 21 14:37:18 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:

The normal '.tar.gz' archive contains everything you
need to compile Apache under Windows, but please note that
it does contain Unix-style line breaks.
We will provide special '.zip' archives for the final
1.3 release and maybe for some of the next beta versions.
