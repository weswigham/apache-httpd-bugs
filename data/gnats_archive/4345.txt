If I send "apache -k restart" to restart apache, it's worked.
but if Apache very busy, it will delay to restart.

For example, at 23:59 PM, there are about 120 clients on
Apahce (PS: KeepAlive if off), then I send "apache -k restart"
, and Apache will restart after 0.5 to 2 hours.

If apache not busy (ps: only 10~20 clients), it's will restart
immediately.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try restart command on a busy NT site. 
>Fix:
Sorry, I don't know.

Restart is not very importent. you can fix it or not.
I got a way to fast restart my apache. just run apache as a batch, like:

:aa
Apache
goto aa

Then, if I want restart apache, run "kill.exe Apache.exe" ,
then both Apache.exe threads will end, and the batch will let
my Apache quick restart :)
If I hope end apache, just close the console windows :~)
(ps:kill.exe is a utility in NT Resource kit,like UNIX's kill)

State-Changed-Why:

This is the expected behavior... win32 lets the servers
finish off their work with a -restart.
Apache -stop/-start sequence will behave as you expect,
but will hurt the users currently retrieving pages.
