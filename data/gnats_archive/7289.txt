>Environment:
Any of the following configurations:
1. Windows 2000 Professional Edition on dual-PIII machine
2. Windows 2000 Server Edition on dual-PIII machine
3. Windows 2000 Server Edition with SP1 on single-proc PIII machine
>Description:
Apache child process crashes on W2K with the following stack trace:

WSHTCPIP! 75011299()
MSAFD! 74fd4484()
MSAFD! 74fd1535()
MSAFD! 74fd6437()
WS2_32! 7503d1d7()
WS2_32! 7503d162()
apache_main(int 8, char * * 0x00421cf0) line 6880
main(int 8, char * * 0x00421cf0) line 15 + 13 bytes
mainCRTStartup() line 338 + 17 bytes
KERNEL32! 77e87903()

The last WIN32 call from Apache is CloseHandle (ap_destroy_mutex) in apache_main.c.

Another type of failure (same test) is that the child process exits from ap_log_assert. ioctlsocket returns socket error 10038 in recvwithtimeout in buff.c. The assertion fails and it calls exit.

Simply run multiple concurrent requests to IsItWorking servlet would reproduce the problem on W2K.


Both failures cause the Apache child to terminate. This problem does not occur on NT on the same hardwares. The failure can be reproduced in 4 different W2K boxes. For some reasons, the expected valid socket handles become invalid and trigger the failure. There is no error indicated in W2K Event Viewer. It does not seem to be a OS configuration problem. Not sure if it is Winsock bug. One person post a mesage in April,2000 but there was no resolution and no stack trace was provided.

The problem only occurs when the concurrent requests are made to JServ. No problem is encountered if the requests are static HTML pages request. No problem is encounter if the requests are made to http://host/jserv/ where it would not create buffer socket and contact JServ (JVM). No problem is encounter is there is only 1 HTTP client. The problem occurs if multiple threads execute APJ12 handler and communicate with JServ in W2K. It does not appear it reaches any OS limit. Sometimes it fails when the process consumes 400 handles or 1200 handles. There are at least 40% free physical memory during the test.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Install Apache 1.3.17, 1.3.14 or 1.3.12.
2. Install ApacheJServ-1.1.2 and JDK 1.2.005.
2. Use default configuration on both apache, mod_jserv and JServ.
3. Both distributed binaries or proper build would expose the problem.
4. Run at least 30 concurrent HTTP clients from another node and each make 100 requests to IsItWorking servlet. (On a single proc machine, run the test for at least 15 minutes. If running HTTP clients on the same node of the apache server, no error would be encountered. It is important to run the client in another machine to expose this problem.)
5. URL: http://host:port/servlets/IsItWorking
6. Watch the process list from Task Manager.

Result:
Apache child process terminates after the test runs for 30 seconds. It either crashes in wshtcpip.dll or exits gracefully after getting an invalid socket error. If not attaching to a debugger, the crash from wshtcpip.dll will NOT report on W2K.

State-Changed-Why:
You are not going to like this solution, but here it is:

reformat your hard disk and install linux. jserv runs
just fine on linux and windows sucks anyway.

The reason is that unless you have a patch to go along
with this bug report, you probably will never see a fix
because JServ is a dead project. (read the 
java.apache.org homepage).

You may wish to try Tomcat, which isn't a dead product.
