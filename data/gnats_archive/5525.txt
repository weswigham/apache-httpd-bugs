>Description:
Apache has the following modules staticly linked:
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_mmap_static.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_log_agent.c
  mod_log_referer.c
  mod_mime_magic.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_info.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_rewrite.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_auth_dbm.c
  mod_auth_db.c
  mod_digest.c
  mod_proxy.c
  mod_expires.c
  mod_headers.c
  mod_usertrack.c
  mod_unique_id.c
  mod_so.c
  mod_setenvif.c
It Dynamicly loads:

LoadModule pam_auth_module    libexec/mod_auth_pam.so
LoadModule perl_module        libexec/libperl.so
LoadModule php3_module        libexec/libphp3.so
LoadModule roaming_module     libexec/mod_roaming.so
LoadModule mysql_auth_module  libexec/mod_auth_mysql.so
LoadModule throttle_module    libexec/mod_throttle.so

Apache starts up and begins to use more and more memory. 
It leaves many sockets in CLOSE_WAIT and the children hand and idle. CPU usage 
hits 100% and the load average has gotten as high as 62.00. A strace of a hung 
child reveals many calls to munmap(). Partial output is include as it spans many 
many similar lines
munmap(0x403be000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403bd000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403bc000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403bb000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403ba000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403b9000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403b8000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403b7000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x403b6000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40392000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40391000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40390000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x4038f000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x4038e000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x4038d000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x4018c000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40016000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40015000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40014000, 4096)                = 0
This problem seems similar to one solved on solaris.
If i add the following lines to my httpd.conf:
ClearModuleList

AddModule http_core.c
AddModule mod_env.c
AddModule mod_log_config.c
AddModule mod_log_agent.c
AddModule mod_log_referer.c
AddModule mod_mime_magic.c
AddModule mod_mime.c
AddModule mod_negotiation.c
AddModule mod_status.c
AddModule mod_info.c
AddModule mod_include.c
AddModule mod_autoindex.c
AddModule mod_dir.c
AddModule mod_cgi.c
AddModule mod_asis.c
AddModule mod_imap.c
AddModule mod_actions.c
AddModule mod_userdir.c
AddModule mod_alias.c
AddModule mod_rewrite.c
AddModule mod_access.c
AddModule mod_auth.c
AddModule mod_auth_dbm.c
AddModule mod_auth_db.c
AddModule mod_digest.c
AddModule mod_proxy.c
AddModule mod_expires.c
AddModule mod_headers.c
AddModule mod_usertrack.c
AddModule mod_unique_id.c
AddModule mod_so.c
AddModule mod_setenvif.c

Apache will take a very long time to start and use lots of memory producing this 
error message: Ouch!  malloc failed in malloc_block()

State-Changed-Why:
Well, have you tried things without all the third party
modules being loaded?

I have no idea what you mean by:
"This problem seems similar to one solved on solaris"

Have you tried attaching gdb to one of the problem processes?

 children hang

 sorry, i guess i should clarify myself.
 
 Before i submitted a bug report i looked at the previous ones. Bug reports
 5412, 4984, and 2386 all seem to have the same symptoms, but they are all
 on solaris machines. I have tried without all the 3rd party modules, and
 removing them does not help. Running GDB on a child results in the
 following output:
