RedHat Linux 5.2, Kernel 2.2.12
>Description:
I'd like an option in mod_proxy so that when I use it with ProxyPass it sends the current REMOTE_ADDR to the mirrored server in a freely choosable HTTP Header, so that the server which is really handling the request knows where the request really came from.

Let me explain our situation: We're having a setup with two different Apache's, one mod_perl'ed, the other one not. We like to send certain requests from the normal server to the mod_perl'ed server on another machine. Unfortunately we lose the original IP in the process. A setup in which we simply run the mod_perl server on the same machine is unfortunately impossible.
>How-To-Repeat:
no problem - enhancement request
>Fix:
A new configuration directive: e.g.:
ProxyPass /foo http//www.foo.com/bar/
ProxyPassIP Original_IP
will add the current REMOTE_ADDR as header
Original_IP: ${REMOTE_ADDR} 
to all proxy requests eg. to the request to www.foo.com/bar/
