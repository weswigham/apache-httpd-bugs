SunOS mardil.elsevier.nl 5.4 Generic_101945-49 sun4m sparc
   - and other similar systems with monor variations
gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
Situation: An open document root with an access controlled (basic auth)
subdirectory. Client on host in the same domain as the server sends a request
with only the host name and directory name with no trailing slash on the
directory name (eg: http://mardil/secure).

Apache sends back an authentication request
Client resends request with auth info
Apache sends Location header with FQDN of server and trailing slash
Client sends request (no auth info as the host has changed)
Apache sends authentication request

>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately I am on the inside of a firewall. Duplicating should be very 
easy from the description.
>Fix:
Avoid sending authentication requests on something that is going to be
redirected immediately like this

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry but there's nothing we can do, because issuing the
redirect requires privs.  This is a client-side issue; the
client is in the position to know what the heck is going on,
and the server isn't.  It's the same if you try anything with
cookies, if the user specifies an incomplete domain then
they'll get cookies for that incomplete domain that won't work
when they use the full domain.

You might be able to pull some magic with mod_rewrite, but
there's nothing we can do to reorder the phases in apache.
Auth comes before the handler ... it has to.  And the handler
isn't called if the auth isn't given.

         The part that has me confused about why this cannot be handled is this.
 
         It is only the subdirectory that is under access control, to find out
 that access control was needed Apache must have recognised it as a directory,
 at this point it is also clearly not a properly formed path (because of the
 missing trailing slash). Couldn't the access request be skipped on this basis,
 or am I missing something subtle here.

 Yes if the object is handled in the filesystem that is true, but there's
 no reason the object has to be handled in the filesystem.  Something later
 on in the phases can decide to map it to a CGI, or to a database object,
 or something else.  Apache has no idea until it runs those phases, and it
 can't run them until the access checks pass.

         Ahah, so this provides a mechanism for using the filesystem to secure
 objects that aren't served from the filesystem. Clever, and perhaps worth
 putting in the FAQ.
 
         Thank you for your time and trouble on this one.
