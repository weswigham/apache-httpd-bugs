SunOS wtva01 5.5.1 Generic_103640-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
gcc version 2.7.2

>Description:
Recently I made an upgrade 1.20 -> 1.3.4
The access.conf-file used to contain a directive like this:
<Limit GET>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 139.79.96            # responsible: John Smith 876 12 34
</Limit>

This worked well with Server version Apache/1.2.0.
but resulted in this error message with 1.3.4:

	"Syntax error on line 49 of /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/access.conf:
	 each octet must be between 0 and 255 inclusive"

Why are comments run through the syntax checker?

>How-To-Repeat:
fire up the daemon with eg.    ./httpd -d /usr/local/etc/httpd/
>Fix:
no

State-Changed-When: Wed Jan 27 05:12:44 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This is a configuration issue, and should be handled on the
newsgroups before being reported as a bug.

comments can only begin at the  beginning of each line.  
They can not begin in the middle of a config line, or after 
any valid directive.
