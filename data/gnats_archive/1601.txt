>Description:
It is not possible to send a 401 - Authentication header without receiving
an 500 Errorcode from the server.

A snip of a script:

  print "HTTP/1.0 401 Authentification\n";
  print "WWW-Authenticate: Basic\n\n";

A snip of error-log:

[error] malformed header from script. 
Bad header=HTTP/1.0 401 Authentification: /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/autho.pl

State-Changed-Why:
Please read the docs and CGI spec before filing a bug
report.

The CGI spec at http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/interface.html
describes this quite well.  CGI is not HTTP and there
is no reason for a server to accept a HTTP status code.
The Status: header can be used if you wish to change
the code returned.

 As I said, please read the CGI spec.  HTTP header codes are not accepted.
 They are not valid.  Apache rejects it because it should because it isn't
 valid.  If you want to send HTTP headers from CGIs you must use nph-
 scripts.
 
 On the other hand, just doing:
 
 	print "Status: 401 authentication required\n";
 	print "WWW-Authenticate: Basic\n\n";
 
 will probably do more like what you want.
