>Environment:
Linux 2.0.34 - 8192 max filehandles, 32768 max inodes, 256 MB RAM, PPro 200 MHz
GCC 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Our webserver system runs two webservers with over 2,000,000 hits per day together.
At random times the webserver fails to accept all connections; some connections are accepted and handled, but lots of connections will not be responded to.
The serverload will drop to very low values when it is in the frozen state.
MaxClients is set to 256, but lots of them are not in use.
Telnetting to port 80 will then result in a timeout.
netstat shows lots of FIN_WAIT1 connections
no errors are reported in error_log
strace of the apache.pid shows nothing, no output at all when the server has frozen (if it's not frozen it shows output).

The problem occurs since we have these two webservers running on the same system. 
When we had one webserver running with the same amount of hits the problem did not occur.
>How-To-Repeat:
It's not predictable when/how the problem is activated. It happens at random times, both busy times and times where not very much accesses are done on the server.
When it is in a frozen up state it can be in this state for a few minutes, but also for hours.
>Fix:
It looks like there's something wrong in the part that finds out if it's for webserver A or for B.

State-Changed-Why:
Is it possible for you to try upgrading to Apache 1.3.3
and Linux kernel 2.0.35 to see if this problem goes away?
Bugs will go away with both upgrades.

Are you running any third-party modules? If so, can this
behavior be duplicated with the latest versions of the
modules, or (better) without the modules?

 At the time this bug was posted Apache 1.3.1 was the newest version
 available and the newest Linux version was 2.0.35. We later applied an
 unofficial patch to the Linux kernel. This patch increases the max. number
 of sockets, the amount of TCP/IP-buffering and other things that increase
 performance of heavily used machines. Since applying the patch our problem
 has been solved. The Apache accepts every connection it can handle.
 
 The patch is a filehandle patch available through
 ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/linux/kernel/unoff-patches/v2.0/filehandle.patch.li
 nux.v8.01
