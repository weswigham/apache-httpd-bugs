>Environment:
Windows 98 SE, german version, newest patches of date October 12th, 2001
>Description:
I've discovered the problem when i was playing around with Newspro 3.8 (script available at http://www.amphibianweb.com/newspro/). it writes news to a file called "news.txt" in html format which you include into your web pages by a SSI include virtual="cgi-bin/news.txt"
this works on my unix box, but not on windows.
instead, the page containing the SSI call will never be displayed - timeout.
also, Apache starts a dormant instance of Notepad which only shows up in the Task Manager. After accessing the faulty page for a few times the system crashes completely.

State-Changed-Why:

This is why ScriptInterpreter Registry is really a bad idea,
a shortcut for those too lazy to set up their config with
proper associatations.  Apache 2.0 has a RegistryStrict
option, that you must associate the ExecCGI verb instead
of trusting the Open verb (bad for .txt files, as you note.)

The workaround is never put .txt files in your cgi-bin, or
get out of the ScriptInterpreterSource Registry habit.
