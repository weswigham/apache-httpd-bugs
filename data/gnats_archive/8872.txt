mod_negotiation and mod_mime are loaded but not
mod_mime_magic.
>Description:
I am trying to setup content negotation and it is half working...

I have in my httpd.conf:
  AddHandler type-map var
  AddEncoding x-gzip gz

and I have in foo.var:
  URI: foo.html
  Content-Type: text/html

  URI: foo.html.gz
  Content-Type: text/html
  Content-Encoding: gzip

Which is here:
http://pthbb.org/services/foo.var

It is indeed processing it properly.
However, when it returns the encoded option I get the following
headers, where Content-Type seems to be overriding Content-Encoding.

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Thu, 01 Nov 2001 02:23:22 GMT
  Server: Apache/1.3.20
  Content-Location: bookmarks.html.gz
  Vary: negotiate,accept-encoding
  TCN: choice
  Last-Modified: Thu, 01 Nov 2001 02:22:56 GMT
  ETag: "308e4-19-3be0b200;308e3-7c-3be0b053"
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  Content-Length: 25
  Content-Type: application/x-gzip
  Content-Encoding: gzip

I've tried the nasty hack of doing a RemoveType gz for this Location
too. I've tried just using MultiViews... How can I get the server to
do Content-Type for gz when it isn't a negotiated encoded document, or
some equivalent that results in the "expected" outcome?
>How-To-Repeat:
See Full Description
>Fix:
Heed The Content-Type in the typemap instead of
that provided elsewhere in the server config.
