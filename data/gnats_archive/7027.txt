  Thanks for your quick response.
  When I declare a user for the service (I tried the Administrator, a special
  user created for it with all permissions) i have the same problem.
 
  The error comming back from Apache is :
  Erreur serveur interne 500 (IN ENGLISH : INTERNAL ERROR 500)
 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -
 
  Exception : EDBEngineError
  Message : Utilisateur ou mot de passe inconnu( IN ENGLISH : USER OR
 PASSWORD
  UNKNOWN).  unavailable database Alias: dbDATA
  HTTP/1.1 500 Utilisateur ou mot de passe inconnu. Date: Wed, 03 Jan 2001
  07:57:10 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Win32) Connection: close
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
  Utilisateur ou mot de passe inconnu.
  The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable
  to complete your request.
  Please contact the server administrator, Frank.Lecocq@Card.fr and inform
  them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that
  may have caused the error.
 
  More information about this error may be available in the server error log.
 
 
  Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while
 trying
  to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
 
 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Apache/1.3.14 Server at 192.68.133.1 Port 80
 
  *--------------
  The error.log contains :
  [Wed Jan 03 08:57:12 2001] [error] [client 192.68.133.15] malformed header
  from script. Bad header=unavailable database: d:/pollouis/cgi-bin/rve.dll
  *---------------
  RVE.DLL is the name of our DLL wich connects to the database.
  dbdata is the name of a string containing the Alias name to our database.
  D: is the data disk. The map directory is ok.
 
 I have tryied the interact option ON or OFF of Apache Service ('allow
 service to interact with the desktop')without success, checked the registry
 entires.
 And this morning it seems to work !!!! and i dont know why ! So i'll go
 further by braking all parameters i've done to understand why. I'll keep you
 informed.
 
 By the way, a friend of mine told me that Apache was also an FTP server ...
 But i haven't seen anything about that in the documentation. Can you confirm
 that Apache is not a FTP server ?
 When you have to use an FTP server, what do you precognise ?
 
 
 Thank for everything. frank Lecocq
