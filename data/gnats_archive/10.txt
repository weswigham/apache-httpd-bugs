State-Changed-Why:
Works for me using AIX's cc on AIX 4.1.x.  What version are

If you have not yet made it work and are still interested
in trying, please let me know and I will suggest a patch.

No longer a problem for user.

Still a problem with some versions of AIX; I have a possible
fix, but can't do anything until someone can test it.

State-Changed-Why:
Ancient PR; isn't a problem on most systems and the source
has changed a lot since then.  If it is still a problem
with 1.2.0 could be resubmitted.
