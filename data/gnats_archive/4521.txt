SunOS 5.7, JDK 1.1.7, JSDK 2.0
>Description:
When redirecting with Location HTTP-header, one should use status code 302
(moved temporarily) instead of 200 (ok). 

In some situations this causes problems.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
In JServConnection.sendRedirect() replace setStaus(SC_OK) with 
setStatus(SC_MOVED_PERMAMENTLY).
