>Description:
If you have a RewriteRule such as:

RewriteRule ^/foo/bar /foo/baz [R]

This will not match URL's such as http://somehost/foo//bar

Obviously this can be taken care of by modifying the RewriteRule to

RewriteRule ^/+foo/+bar /foo/baz [R]

However, shouldn't mod_rewrite take care of this for you? If you use
the Redirect directive from mod_alias, the multiple slashes are collapsed:
            /* any number of '/' in the alias matches any number in
             * the supplied URI, but there must be at least one...

It looks like all mod_rewrite has to do is call no2slash at the
beginning of hook_uri2file. 

This is probably only wanted when the rule is a redirect rule.

State-Changed-Why:
Hmmm.... I personally think mod_rewrite should _not_
collaps multiple slashes in URLs before applying
the patterns. Because first when I remember correctly
the URLs /foo/bar/ and /foo//bar/ are defined as
different URLs (fix me here, when I'm wrong) and
second the intent behind mod_rewrite actually
is that you can manipulate the URLs in the format
as close to what it is given in the request. Automatically
collapsing slashes and other things would result
in big surprises by the users, IMHO. The only think
we _could_ do is to provide a [NO2SL] flag, or whatever
we name it, which explicitly collapses the slashes.
But I'm not very happy even about this idea, because
I still think when you have URLs with double slashes
in it it's an error at all.
