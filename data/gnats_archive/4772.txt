>Description:
At first kernel errors about "too many open files" are reported, then apache threads crash (they were crashing and respawning for a rather long period of time).
>How-To-Repeat:
Try a bigger load, so the limit of open files would be reached. Then you will see that 
all threads are dieing and respawning and dieing etc...
>Fix:
the first one - to check for this limit/whatever. and to document, that this can be a serious problem on FreeBSD...
