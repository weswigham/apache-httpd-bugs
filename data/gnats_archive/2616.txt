>Description:
Apache exits with error code 1 after startup if the configuration directory has been changed form the default.
Errors are logged to logs/error_log :
	[Tue Jul 14 15:20:12 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: httpd: could not open mime types log file /usr1/home/wbm/project/conf/mime.types.

the listed directory "conf" is never referenced in any ".conf" file

Similar problems occur if the default "logs" is changed.


>How-To-Repeat:
Copy the default configuration from an installed apache 1.3.0 etc directory
Edit conf files to reflect your current location. I used relative directory notation where possible.
Start apache with the -f parameter pointing to the http.conf file that has been moodified.
>Fix:
work around: change the name of the configuration and logs directory to the default "conf and logs"

State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Wed Jul 15 07:51:08 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

See <http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#typesconfig>
and <http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#lockfile>.

Both the LockFile and TypesConfig directives have hard-coded
defaults, and neither is listed explicitly in the .conf-dist
files (although LockFile is there with its hard default, but
commented out).

I have added the default TypesConfig directive to the
srm.conf-dist* files.

Thanks for using Apache!
