>Description:
If I use a letter "ˆ" (o with two dots above it) in a URL, I get Error 404
because the URL gets truncated right before the offending character. Other
scandinavian characters (Â‰≈ƒ÷) do not produce this error. I am not using any
special modules or .htaccess or directives in this directory.

This appears to be a Solaris-related problem.  If I create
such a file on a box running FreeBSD, it works fine.  On
Solaris, it doesn't.  Will take a look when I get a chance...

 Please try 1.2.1.  It appears to magically fix this problem for me; let me
 know if it does the same for you.

 No...it behaves just the same for me...you can see it at
 http://clovis.oulu.fi/Â‰ˆ≈ƒ÷.html
 
 I have Apache/1.2.1 mod_perl/1.00b1 now.

 Humor me and try compiling it with the distributed Configuration file and
 no extra modules.  Also try compiling it and disabling optimization (ie.
 add an OPTIM= line to Configuration to disable the -O2).
 
 Do you have Sun's SC4.x compiler?  Normally installed under
 /opt/SUNWspro/.  If so, try with that.
 
 Yesterday I am sure it was working fine compiled in some way with gcc.
 Now I can't repeat that.  However, today it works fine compiled with
 SC4.2.  Arrrgh.

State-Changed-Why:
This appears to be magically fixed in the current 1.3 tree.
I can reproduce it with 1.2.4 easily, but have no problems
with the 1.3b3-dev tree, so I'm guessing something changed
somewhere to fix it.

In any case, technically such characters should be % 
encoded as per the URL spec.

Comment-Added:
Using gcc, and EXTRA_CFLAGS=-funsigned-char is another way
to workaround this problem.
