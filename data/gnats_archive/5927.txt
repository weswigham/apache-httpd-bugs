>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.3 (fully patched) and later.
Solaris 2.5 (fully patched) and later.
>Description:
PR#4122 (mmap without limit considered harmful) describes how Irix will
allocate swap to cover an mmap allocation, and includes a patch to not use
mmap for files greater than 4 MB.  This patch is in the source for 1.3.12.

But it makes no sense for an operating system to reserve swap space for a
read-only map.  I wrote a simple test program, and even (old) SunOS 4.1.3 and
(old) Solaris 2.5 don't reserve any swap space with a read-only map.

And, mmap is most useful on large files.

At the end of this message is the test program I used.  I ran it as

        pstat -s; tst big_file & sleep 2; pstat -s; kill

on Solaris 2.5, or

        swap -s; tst big_file & sleep 2; swap -s

on SunOS 4.1.3 .

=============================================================================
#include <sys/mman.h>
main(argc, argv)
 int argc;
 char *argv[];
{
  int fd, len;
  struct stat statbuf;

  if ((fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY)) < 0)
        return(1);
  if (fstat(fd, &statbuf) < 0)
        return(2);

#ifndef MAP_FAILED
# define MAP_FAILED  ((void *) -1)
#endif
  if (MAP_FAILED == mmap(NULL, statbuf.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0))
        return(3);

  printf("mapped %d MB; sleeping for a minute...\n", statbuf.st_size >> 20);
  sleep(60);
  return(0);
}
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I propose either:

        1) define MMAP_LIMIT to be very large in general, and set it to
           a smaller value on operating systems that are broken.

        2) set MMAP_LIMIT to a very large value for those operating
           systems that aren't broken.
