State-Changed-Why:

This is fixed in the latest version of JServSSI.  You can
get this with the latest snapshot of the JServ source tree
(the 0.9.x tree is no longer in development); the snapshots
are available from http://java.working-dogs.com/daily/

This bug will be marked closed when a checkpointed version
of the 1.0b development tree is released, unless we hear
that this is still a problem.

FYI -- to fix this for all OSes requires a bit more code;
check out http_main.c in the Apache 1.3 distribution, if
you're curious.  But the patch looks fine for standard
unixes.

Thanks for the bug report and patch!
