>Description:
After upgrading from Apache 1.1.3 to Apache 1.2.1 the httpd doesn't start.
I use the same configuration files (httpd.conf, access.conf & srm.conf) 
as with 1.1.3. The httpd reports:
% open: No such file or directory
Cannot open lock file

I checked if the access rights are OK for the httpd.pid file and the other 
log files but the appear to be normal.

What do I wrong ?

With regards

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Improve the error messages so that's its clear which lock file gives
the problem and where it tries to open the file

State-Changed-Why:
See the CHANGES file; if you don't have a logs/ directory under your server root,
use the LockFile directive to set a different lockfile.

The error message accidently ommitted the path; that has
been noted in numerous PRs and is fixed in the next version.
