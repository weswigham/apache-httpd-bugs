>Environment:
Redhat Linux 4.1 with 2.0.29 kernel, and Redhat upgrades. 486/100.
>Description:
Building b11 on Linux, Configure sets LIBS1 in Makefile to -ldbm. In
b10 this was set to -ldb, with identical Configuration files. I have
db and gdbm installed and also included -lgdbm in EXTRA_LIBS. However,
I do not have dbm. Thus, the final link fails. I can't figure out what
LIBS1 is for, as it seems unrelated to mod_auth... If apache needs
one of these, Configuration should check which one(s) are available.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
For me, just deleting LIBS1 from Makefile. Otherwise see above

State-Changed-Why:
This will be fixed in 1.3.  You could add:
    DBM_LIB=""
to the appropriate linux section of the Configure file.
