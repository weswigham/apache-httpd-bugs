>Environment:
Windows 2000, Apache 1.3.12, ApacheJserv/1.1.2, JSDK 2.0, JDK 1.2
>Description:
My problem is exactly like the one in PR#3697.  I added the following lines, per PR#3697, <LOCATION /servlets> Options None....etc </Location> to the jserv.conf file(also tried the httpd.conf with no luck).  When I access a servlet they run without any username and password window appearing.

Security on the sevlets directory is actually a workaround for what I'm really trying to do.  I already have user authentication on the htdocs directory working fine.  However when a simple html calls my servlet it does not pass the user name along to the servlet, ie when I call getRemoteUser it is always null.  

I would prefer to just have the html form send the user name to the servlet, but I don't know how to do that.  If that is not possible, I guess getting user authentication directly on the servlets directory would suffice.

Thank you for any help.
Dave
