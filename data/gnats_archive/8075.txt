>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Precompiled 1.3.20 in console, Windows 95 OSR2, WinSock2, PHP as module (4.0.6)
>Description:
When I want to install some programs, my system hangs and when I shoot down Apache, instalation will finish it's work. In some situations (commensurate with installed program), I have to shoot down installation too and then repeat installation process. Firewall usage doesn't affect it.
