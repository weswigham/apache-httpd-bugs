>Description:
Apache 1.3.4 wont start. Its complaining about not enough file descriptors.
On the same machine, a Apache 1.2.1 does NOT complain with the same
configuration (about 150 virtual hosts with logfiles).

Re-compiling with -DNO_SLACK did not fix the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
cant, the server is not starting
>Fix:
not at all, how does 1.3.4 handles file descriptors different
then 1.2.1 ???

 No, only a few have an error or agentlogm all together, there
 are 162 logs.
 
 Using Version 1.2.x works great with this amount, 1.3.4
 only works when I have less than 40 logfiles.
 
 Kind regards, Frank

You probably built 1.2.x and 1.3.x differently... and the 1.3
server is reading some silly access.conf or srm.conf file.
Try "strace -e open -f ./httpd" and take a look at what files
it's opening.  You'll probably figure it out from that.

 Got no mail, so I couldnt response, the problem still
 exists in all versions of Apache (even 2.x).
 
 because it keeps seperate logfiles open, instead of
 opening them when needed (and maybe caching some
 filehandles) it impossible to have more then roughly
 130 virtual domains running on the same machine.
 
 A caching mechanism for open file handles would
 be the best. Lets see I allow 40 Handles to be open,
 apache counts the requests and keeps thos log open
 with where the most busy during the last 10 Minutes
 or so, if they are not busy, its opening and
 closing the files like needed.
 
 Whats about that ?

Comment-Added:

This would require a major change in the architecture
that Apache uses to log, and is really not worthwhile.
Most modern operating systems have a way to increase
the number of available file handles, and you can also
alleviate the problem by using piped logs and pipe to
a program that does its own splitting.
