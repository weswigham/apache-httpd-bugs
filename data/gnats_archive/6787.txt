>Environment:
Windows 4.0 Workstation with SP6 installed
>Description:
In httpd.conf i've specified a name using ServerName directive, but i can't use this name in browsers to open the main page of the server.
The same httpd.conf used with an identical installtion of Apache 1.3.9 gives me the posibility of using the name specified with ServerName in IE5.0 and Netscape 4.57.
I mention that the only change i've made is unistalling version 1.3.14 and installing 1.3.9 preserving httpd.conf.

Do the same thing i do!!!

Nope

State-Changed-Why:

Need to preparse the ServerRoot to report errors to the
user before failing to serve requests, when the ServerRoot
name contains invalid characters by the DNS specification.
