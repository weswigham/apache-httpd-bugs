I seem to have messed up the bugdb.  Stuff is appearing
in the wrong PRs.  Just cleaning up.

Well, from my perspective 8-), suggesting that a change to having
PATH_TRANSLATED be that of the arguments to the "#exec cgi" would be
a wonderful solution. That said, it's bound to break someone else's
CGI code that relies on the other behavior. I guess that if #include
were to be *fixed* (?) that would make me happier too. Barring that,
I would need to consider using http://www/cgi-bin/foo?arg=/path/to/file
which is bound to be more portable anyway...
