>Description:
We are using TransferLogs (as recommended) to rotate our logs daily, using rotatelogs.
Our httpd.conf file is set as follows (excerpt only):

# Log rotation:
# Rotate the logs every 24 hours.
#
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" \"%{cookie}ni\"" combined

TransferLog "|/usr/HTTPServer/bin/rotatelogs /usr/HTTPServer/logs/access_log 86400"

According to the online documentation, the TransferLog directive should use the last defined LogFormat directive (in our case, the one directly preceding it).  However, the TransferLog directive seems to ignore the LogFormat and always produces a log using the (default) Common format.

Note: the formatting works just fine with the CustomLog directive.

These symptoms occur whether rotatelogs is used, or another log rotation utility such as Cronolog.

State-Changed-Why:

Please see the docs for LogFormat, which tell you that
there are two syntaxes of this directive.  When
Logformat is specified with one argument, it defines
the format for future TransferLog directives.  When
it is specified with two arguments (as you have done)
it ONLY defines a nickname, and does not change the
TransferLog.

As an alternative, you can use CustomLog which can accept
the nickname defined by LogFormat.

Thanks for using Apache!
