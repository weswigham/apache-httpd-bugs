>Description:
Installed Apache on C:, works fine
Added a directory on D: to access.conf using <Directory> etc.
Linked (using NT explorer) from C:/Apache/htdocs/sblah to D:/blah
Created an HREF in C:/Apache/htdocs/index.html to sblah
Browser cannot browsr the D:/blah directory
Checked that D:/blah and all subdirs and files are readable to everyone
Is NT symlink handled by Apache?
>How-To-Repeat:
Please see above to create example.
>Fix:
If Apache does not do so already, include NT symlink support

State-Changed-Why:
NT doesn't have symbolic links.  It has a very ugly
hack attempt at something resmebling them.  They are not
currently supported, but I guess they may be at some point.
Perhaps.

 Use any one of numerous directives (eg. Alias) to tell Apache to look in
 another directory for other files.
