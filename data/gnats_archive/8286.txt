>Release:        1.3.20
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
- Red Hat 7.1 (fresh, "virgin" installation, with all modules) on a Dell Optiflex GX150 (PIII, 128Mb RAM).
- ezPublish installer 1.0 (see below)
>Description:
You get a segmentation fault and, sometime, a core dump when you try to start the HTTPd. You could get a "segmentation fault" line in the error.log, too.

I detected this problem while tring to install "ezPublish" (see http://developer.ez.no), by using its bash installer, on a new Red Hat 7.1 machine. ezPublish installs a second copy of the HTTPd, beside the one installed by RH7.1, and configure it for using virtual hosts and rewrite rules. ezPublish uses both mod_so and mod_rewrite, already suspected to produce this kind of problem (see Report #4577, #6204 and #8205).

ezPublish installer could give a good opportunity to reproduce those bugs and study them.
>How-To-Repeat:
- make a fresh install of Red Hat 7.1
- install ezPublish 2.1 by using it bash installer 1.0 (see http://developer.ez.no)
- start the HTTPd installed by ezPublish (/opt/ezpublish/apacheXXXX/bin/httpd). 
>Fix:
I did not find any workaround.
