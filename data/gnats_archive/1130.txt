State-Changed-Why:
What method of access restriction are you using for the
directory?

The username you give only has 8 characters; do you mean
8 or more?

Do you have a index file in the directory or is it a
automatically generated directory listing?  Try the other
one and see if you have the same problem.

I failed to reproduce this effect under Linux 2.0.30
(using mod_auth).

   Basic, with .htaccess (requires valid-user) and dbm file.

   No, I don't have any index.htm[l] file.
   I have tried, and with index.html, the log is ok.

This appears to be the same problem as PR#1500, see
http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1500 for a patch.  That
patch will be available in 1.2.6, which should be released
shortly.
