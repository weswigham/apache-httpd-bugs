>Description:
I'm trying (all day long) to map URI of the form /x/ to /servlets/myAliasedClass/

I think that ApJServMount makes it very obfuscated. 
I tried:
RewriteRule ^/x/(.*) /servlets/myAliasedClass/
I tried it with [PT] option. But it doesn't work. The url is mapped to the filesystem. But the /servlets mount point is not in the filesystem itself. So I get 404.
It works if I remap it using external redirection. But that's not what I like.

In case of CGI/mod-perl/fcgi/you-name-it it's pretty easy to map URI's internally. But it seems impossible for servlet. 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
1. Some sort of ServletAlias.
2. ApJServAction handler-type /uri/to/servlet
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^
  And I mean 'handler' not 'extension'.
   (then I would be able to SetHandler for some location).
   I call it a bug that mod_jserv is extension based,
   not mime or handler-type based.
