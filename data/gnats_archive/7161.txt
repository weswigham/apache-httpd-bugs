>Environment:
MS-Visual C++ 6.0, MS Windows 2000, Apache 2.0.9a
>Description:
My problem with the Apache 2.x is that the environment for MS Windows systems and MS-Visual 6.0 is too complicated. The *.dsp, *.dsw doesn't accepted by the Visual environment. The message, which came when a *.dsp will be loaded is that it is not created in a Visual environment. So I have to create my own makefile environment to compile the Apache project. Why you aren't delivering makefiles instead of *.dsp, *dsw files ? So I have many frustration about an very good product, what shouldn't be happened.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Please, could you delivering your next (patch/release) of Apache 2.x enclosing a makefile environment for MS Windows systems. Thanks a lot

State-Changed-Why:

You are evidently using a .tar.gz package without converting
the line endings, or using a unix'ish CVS.  Modern cvs's
on Win32 are aware of text files and fix cr/lf line endings,
and a .zip file is also available for simplicities sake.

Please indicate what method you used to grab the sources,
and which msvc version you are using.
