Not really an Apache problem, but other proxies don't behave the same way
and so it looks bad for Apache.

A CRLF in a POST body is probably not a requirement in HTTP/1.x, however
some clients transmit it (Communicator) and some servers expect it (Oracle).
Even though the body length matches the Content-length: header, the server
in question fails to proceed with the request.
>How-To-Repeat:
Connect to: 
http://www.transigo.net.au/transigo/pp_dirs_su_registration1.org_entry_page
And click the Submit button.  The server waits forever to proceed.
>Fix:
Perhaps include a ServerMatch rule to add a CRLF to the end of a POST body.

This patch seems to work, but should be checked by a REAL C programmer:

State-Changed-Why:

Does this still occur with Apache 1.3.3?

Do you mean that the trailing CRLF is included in the
Content-Length, or follows the Content-Length'th byte?

State-Changed-Why:

We don't forward the extra CRLF because it would be
a violation of the HTTP specification.  Broken origin
servers need to be fixed at the origin server.
