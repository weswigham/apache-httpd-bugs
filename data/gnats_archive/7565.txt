SunOS muir 5.7 Generic_106541-15 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60
>Description:
mpm -- threaded

The server always started with 3 processes.  
>How-To-Repeat:
1) change "StartServers" to 1 in <IfModule threaded.c> block
2) restart server
I expect there is only 1 process created
>Fix:
in threaded.c:
the function threaded_pre_config() has the following code:
ap_daemons_to_start = DEFAULT_START_DAEMON;

we might want to do the following:
if (ap_daemons_to_start == 0)
  ap_daemons_to_start = DEFAULT_START_DAEMON;

State-Changed-Why:
I do not believe this is actually a bug.  You are correct,
you had three processes running, when you configured for
only 1 process.  However, not all of these were serving
requests.

one of those processes was the parent process, it would have been running as root.  

The second was the cgid daemon, this can be proven by 
reconfiguring using the options --enable-cgi 
--disable-cgid.

The final process was actually serving requests.  This is
what the StartServers 1 was doing.

The reason you didn't see a change between the two 
configurations, is that the default config in Apache
2.0.16 started three processes, and then killed off
two of them due to Min/Max SpareServers.  This should
be fixed in the next release of 2.0.

If you are able to reproduce this, with cgi instead of
cgid, and all three processes are owned by the user
specified in the config file, please let us know.

Thank you for using Apache.
