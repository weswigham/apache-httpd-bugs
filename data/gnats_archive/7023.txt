OpenBSD new 2.8 GENERIC i386
>Description:
The ReadmeName and HeaderName directives only work in the context of a single directory.  Supplying it with a value such as .header.html will get it to include the .header.html file from the directory currently being browsed (ie it works locally).  If the HeaderName and ReadmeName directives are specified with something global like /var/include/footer.html this is not recognised (ie it doesn't work globally).  This is the case whether the directives are set in the main body of the configuration file or inside a Directory directive inside a VirtualHost.  Documentation dating back to NCSA HTTPd seems to suggest that supplying it with a full pathname to a particular file (ie so the listings for the whole site include the same file) should work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Supply ReadmeName and HeaderName directives in httpd.conf with full pathnames to a file that you'd like included.
>Fix:
Recognise full pathnames in the ReadmeName and HeaderName directives.
