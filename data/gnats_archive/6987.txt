Hi,

I'm new to this ...
I extract everything to my /tmp directory 
run ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache ... works fine.
then do make  and I get hte following error after which it stops.

moves to src/os/unix
rm -f libos.a
ar cr libos.a os.o os-inline.o
make: *** [libos.a] killed

I am obviously missing something any help would be appreciated.

Thanx
