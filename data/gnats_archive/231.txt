>Environment:
BSDI 2.1 Fully Patched and BSDI 3.0 dist.  gcc is the compiler 
>Description:
When configuring Apache for more than 125 virtual hosts that use one single 
ip address http1.1 style, the child process start dumping core.  It's 
interesting that the parent process does not dump core.  The syptoms of this are
are web pages that should be working, coming up as either connection reset by
peer or document contains no data.  A check of the error_log while this is going
on shows the child process giving out a segment violation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure a bsd/os server with 126 or more virtual web servers http1.1 style.  
We are unable to test with any other OS at this time.

State-Changed-Why:
While this is most definately a problem with too few file descriptors
apache should not core dump because of it.  If possible could
you provide us with a stack trace from gdb on the core dump?

To avoid the core dump you'll need to either increase the number
of descriptors available (see the limit command) or run multiple
apaches and use Listen to spread the vhosts amongst them.
