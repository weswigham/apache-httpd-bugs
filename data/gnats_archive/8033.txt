>Description:
They just sit around in a state of 'G' and eventually I run out of free servers and the webserver becomes unresponsive.
>How-To-Repeat:
well, if you goto my website (quikbox.ca) and bring up the status page, then visit a whole lot of pages in quick succession, the webserver tends to go down and the status page (or any other page for that matter) can not be called up any longer.
>Fix:
I have been experimenting with increasing my number of free servers and reducing the timeouts but it hasn't gotten to a useable level yet.
