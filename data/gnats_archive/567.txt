>Environment:
Any HP-UX system
>Description:
There are two problems here. Configure isn't adding the "-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE"
flags like it's supposed to when cc is the compiler. Also, Configure doesn't 
set OPTIM properly for the HP-UX C compiler syntax ("+O2" instead of "-O2", 
even "-O" would work).

Running a make, after running Configure on an HP-UX 10.X system, yields:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        cc -c   -O2 -DHPUX10   alloc.c
cc: warning 422: Unknown option "2" ignored.
cc: "conf.h", line 544: error 1000: Unexpected symbol: "size_t".

cc: error 2017: Cannot recover from earlier errors, terminating.
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Configure, and then run make, on any HP-UX system.
>Fix:
1. Delete or comment out the OPTIM=-O2 line in Configuration and Configuration.tmpl

2. Add OPTIM=+O2 to the *-hp-hpux*) and *-hp-hpux10.*) case sections in Configure.

3. Make sure that the CC variable is set properly before the above case section
   executes, so that the if [ "$CC" = "cc" ] will evaluate and set CFLAGS
   properly

State-Changed-Why:
Dupe of PR#445.

Fixed in the latest development tree.  You can download
the latest snapshot from 

	http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/

and verify that it works for you.  It does not set -O
or +O2, but now it doesn't set -O2 when using cc on HPUX.

Note that the current snapshot is broken and will not 
build; try it in a day or two.

Thanks.
