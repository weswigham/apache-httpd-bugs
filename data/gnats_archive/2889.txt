It involves all RPM-compatible platforms (e.g. most Unices)
>Description:
I prefer to install Apache as an RPM. I downloaded and installed an excellent 1.3.0 RPM, which included all the important modules compiled as DSOs. All you need to do is install the package and comment out the undesired modules from the httpd.conf (and set up the rest etc). Great! I was a happy bunny.

I then came across a couple of modules that rely on v1.3.1, so naturally I look for a 1.3.1 RPM and just do an upgrade. The 1.3.1 RPMs I found didn't contain all the desired modules, and weren't even laid out the same (docs/binaries etc).

Next step, then, is to grab the 1.3.0 spec, 1.3.1 source and update the spec file, and build my RPM. Great!

I can just picture others around the world having the same dilemma, and going through the same crap. Hence this suggestion.

If we have one common spec file to build from, and if we distributed some Apache-endorsed (?) RPMs at release time, much wasted coding time could be avoided.
>How-To-Repeat:
See http://rufus.w3.org/ for the RPM database. There are various RPMs for Apache, all with different characteristics.
>Fix:
In order to make Apache easier to install, perhaps a spec file should be adopted and maintained in the source. A small group of volunteers could then build and post some pre-built RPMs for various platforms as part of the release process.

I have the basic spec file and configuration patches from the first (best) distribution. I suggest checking them into an /rpm directory in CVS. I still have some improvements in mind that I can make to it.

 The problem is that I don't see peple actually using one common file.
 It seems that every distribution maker wants to change their own things
 to make Apache the way "they" like it, regardless of how the distribution
 is.  
 
 There are also enough differences (eg. paths) between systems that changes
 would have to be made anyway.

 That's up to the distribution makers. We could still help out by
 providing the base spec file. They would then only need change the
 filenames, if they desire. It would save each distribution maker at
 least some time. Anyway, that shouldn't stop us from being able to
 provide a 'default' brew.

 What differences? I don't have much experience with Debian, but RedHat
 is based on a filesystem standard (FSSTND?).
 
 I would _really_ like to see a spec file included in CVS. I think it
 would be a great benefit to the project, making
 installation/upgrade/removal of the software much easier. Can anyone
 provide any reason why this would not be beneficial?
