Comment-Added:

This isn't the cause of the problem, but your Alias directives
need to preserve parity wrt terminal '/' characters.  In
other words, you need to change

 Alias /files/ "F:/VV_Word"

to

 Alias /files/ "F:/VV_Word/"

 Hi! :))
 
 Thanks for your response..... , But it seems that the problem is not in
 configuration file.
 That was configured like you wrote .
  I'll try to explain a disposition again. There are two NT machines on the
 same NT domain
 "FhKn". First machine is VVL2 second one VVL6. Apache server is running on
 VVL2
  Folder \\VVL6\Apache_org is mapped as network drive G:\ on VVL2 . there is
 a full sharing
  and full permissions open on that folder.
 Both systems are NT Workstation 4.0 (Service Pack 4)
 So lets look at configuration file. Part of aliases contain following
 
 Alias /Apache/ "G:/Number1/"
 
 So that's it . When I run Apache as console application it works perfectly!
 By the way even  when I tried to change this line to
 
 Alias /Apache/ "G:/Number1"
 
 It steel works!! ;-))
 But when I try to run Apache as NT service it doesn't work,  !
 Here is what it reports for Browser
 -------------------CUT HERE------------------------------------------------
 Forbidden
 You don't have permission to access /Apache/ on this server.
 -------------------CUT HERE------------------------------------------------
 
 And here is what it logs to error log file

 ------------------CUT HERE-------------------------------------------------
 
 I don't do something special just : Shut down Apache console app, then
 start Apache Service with the absolutely same httpd.conf file.
 
 Here is the <Directory> directive from conf file maybe it'll be interesting
 --------------------CUT HERE----------------------------------------
 <Directory />
     Options FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride None
 </Directory>
 
 <Directory "C:/httpDocs">
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride None
  Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
 </Directory>
 ------------------CUT HERE------------------------------------------

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: kparz@raleigh.ibm.com
State-Changed-When: Fri Mar 26 14:55:21 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Hello,

This is not an Apache problem. You are struggling with
using Services on Windows NT.  From your description
I see a couple of problems.

1) Your access denied problem: When you are starting 
Apache as a service, I'm betting that you are starting
using "Local System" account.  Local System has restricted
rights when it comes to network operations.  You need
to change the "Startup" login of the service to an 
account that has access rights to the shared drives.

2) You're using the mapped drive letters in your
aliases:  This will not work when you reboot your NT
system because the drives will not be mapped before
someone logs in.  You should probably use the actual
network share name in the alias (e.g. //VVL6/Apache_org/)

Hope this helps.

Thanks for using Apache.
