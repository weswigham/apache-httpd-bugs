>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Sun Solaris 7 x86 106542-17
gcc 2.95.3
>Description:
Currently issuing:

  apachectl stop
  apachectl startssl

can produce the following output:

  apachectl stop: httpd stopped
  apachectl startssl: httpd (pid 3142) already running

since apachectl doesn't wait for httpd to actually terminate
(it just sends the signal).  On a fast machine the startssl
may happen before httpd terminates.
>How-To-Repeat:
Issue:

  apachectl stop
  apachectl startssl

on a fast machine.
