 Greetings,
 
 This is a short follow-up to the message I sent you yesterday if you haven'=
 t had the opportunity to visit www.theansweto.com/timefreedom. As an Indepe=
 ndent Representative for Excel-Bell Canada Enterprises (NYSE: BCE) -- you c=
 an work your own hours, full or part-time, without giving up anything you d=
 o right now. There are no products to purchase, no deliveries to make, no e=
 mployees or inventory to manage, no money to collect, and no quotas to meet=
  ever.  Someone gets paid for this everyday - it might as well be YOU!
 
 Our company owns the largest Internet network, and the second largest fiber=
  optic and switching voice network on the planet. We are positioned as a ma=
 jor player in the e-commerce market as we enter the new century. 
 
 Why?
 
 Well, the number of Internet subscribers DOUBLES worldwide every 100 days. =
 A study conducted by the University of Texas at Austin (see Business Week M=
 agazine, November 8, 1999, page 46) predicts, the Internet economy could ge=
 nerate more than $500 billion in revenue in 2000--up from $8 billion in 199=
 4! As you saw in my presentation, e-commerce will reach the trillions in th=
 e next few years.
 
 Wouldn't you or the non-profit organization(s) you want to support like to =
 get a slice of that Trillion Dollar Pie?
 
 As a company representative, you too can have your own web site with an onl=
 ine Super Store that has over 17 million name brand products and services f=
 or sale 20% to 50% below store prices. Excel pays its representatives up to=
  50% of the gross profits generated from their personal web site. All you d=
 o is refer people to it. Every time they buy, you or your non-profit organi=
 zation(s) gets paid!
 
 I really felt I couldn't afford NOT to do it. Interested? Let's get started=
 .
 
 In order for me to contact you so that we can discuss details, please e-mai=
 l me with your phone number and a good time to call. I look forward to talk=
 ing with you!
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Runee Harris
