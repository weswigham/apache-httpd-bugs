>Description:
When setting MaxRequestsPerChild to "200" for example, if you look the server-status you can see that number of accesses per child can go up to "500" , it seems that either MaxRequestsPerCild is not applied or the number of accesses per child of server-status is not accurate.

State-Changed-Why:
MaxRequestsPerChild is actually a limitation on the maximum _connections_ per child. Keepalive requests aren't included. Say, for example, for every connection, there are 4 additional keepalive requests after the first. So after 100 connections, the process would have handled 500 requests. If MaxRequestsPerChild were set to 100, then you'd see that it had handled 500 requests.

The present documentation makes this more clear.
