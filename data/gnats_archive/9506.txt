 Long Island, NY - January 16, 2002 - 
 The NROTC scholarship is a full tuition, 4-year 
 scholarship that can be expanded to 5 years in certain 
 degree programs.  Once you receive your Bachelor's 
 Degree, you will be commissioned as an Ensign in the 
 Navy Reserve (active duty) for a period of 4 years 
 minimum.  In addition to full tuition, cost of all 
 textbooks, and lab fees, you will also receive a $250.00 
 per month stipend. 
 
 To participate in the scholarship program you must 
 meet the minimum SAT/ACT scores (530 verbal, 520 
 math/22 English, 22 math for ACT).
 
 One of the great things about the NROTC 
 scholarship, is that it can be used at over 100 colleges 
 and universities such as:  Notre Dame, Penn State, 
 Morehouse, Hampton University, Harvard, and MIT, to 
 name a few.  While still enjoying the every day life of 
 college, you will wear a uniform once a week, go on 
 midshipmen cruises during the summer, and best of all 
 receive your commission as an Ensign in the Navy 
 Reserve upon graduation.
 
 REMEMBER, THERE IS NO 
 OBLIGATION TO APPLY.  THERE IS NO OBLIGATION 
 UNTIL THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR SOPHOMORE YEAR IN 
 COLLEGE, SO YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR IS FREE.  If you 
 have any questions or concerns, or would like an 
 application mailed to you please call (516) 683-2508 or 
 email nrotc_ny@cnrc.navy.mil.
