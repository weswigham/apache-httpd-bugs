SunOS xyz 5.8 Generic_108528-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
>Description:
I'm using the mod_proxy module to proxy to another server that sets multiple cookies in the same request. Only the last one appears in the response.

The patch mentioned in bug 9768 changes the behavior, but does not completely fix it.

The patch merges all cookies and returns them on a single line. This is correct according to the HTTP specification. But a lot of clients out there are not able to correctly interpret this.

We need a fix which restores the original behavior, namely returning multiple cookies on multiple lines.
