>Description:
This is not a bug What i can say enhancement required in JServ.
As you have told in document Jserv will be overtaken by Tomcat.
Major Application are using Apache with JServ. In this case how do you 
provide Tomcat as config changes with Apache.

The problem arise i wanted Apache - Jserv to support struts framework.
Struts  doesn't work. Since  i m using Oracle9ias  Portal for devleopment.
This by default uses APache -Jserv. currently  Oracle Portal new release is in
devleopment stage. 

Regards,
Cleophus Pereira
