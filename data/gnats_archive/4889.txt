>Description:
When I try to shut down apache, I get:

C:\TMP\ia>apache -k shutdown
[Sun Aug 22 12:37:16 1999] [emerg] (2)The system cannot find the file specified
 OpenEvent on ap462_shutdown event

C:\TMP\ia>

The server is working fine. I just can't shut it down. I can't find any file
"OpenEvent". Is it suppossed to be in 1.3.9. Only thing special is that I
installed in \Apache instead of the default location. 

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
No, because I don't know what the missing file is or where it is suppossed to be.
