I am getting this error:

[Thu Jul 05 18:13:29 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] couldn't spawn child process: c:/apache/apache/cgi-bin/printenv.pl

I just installed Apache, I just installed Perl; What else? As usual, open-source software is provided as-is, and many messages on DEJANEWS are without any plausible answers about this "couldn't spawn child process:" problem.

>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache on Windows 2000.
Install Perl on Windows 2000.
You will have the problem reproduced.
>Fix:
Just work hard.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
