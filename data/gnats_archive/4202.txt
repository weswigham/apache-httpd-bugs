>Description:
When I save a file then request it, the last-modified header doesn't reflect
the mtime according to stat(), but instead appears to only *gradually* increase
for a minute, reporting a different last-modified time each time it is accessed
until it does match up with mtime.  This throws off a particular utility of mine 
that "watches" a url and triggers an event when it changes, causing spurious
updates.  I'm not certain if this is a feature of some sort, but it certainly
appears to be counterintuitive...

State-Changed-Why:
Apache reports the mtime as seen by the stat() system call.

If I had to guess, I'd guess that you're saving the file
over NFS (or mabye CIFS/windows sharing crud).  The host
saving the file has a clock in the future.  Apache refuses
to respect an mtime in the future -- for that it uses the
current time.
