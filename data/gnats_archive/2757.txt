>Environment:
Linux 2.0.35, egcs, 
>Description:
Apache will not write to access logs over nfs unless the access log is
chown to the httpd user.  NFS options no_root_squash is set, yet seems
to be ignored.  linux-kernel believes that since the file is initially
opened as root, and then fails to write, that it's an apache bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
yes.	
>Fix:
no.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sat Aug  1 13:48:39 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
No, it is not an Apache problem.  As I have already told
you, this is an issue with your OS.  Two possible problems
are that root is remapped remotely (you say you disabled
that but that doesn't necessarily mean it did what you
want...) or Linux's NFS does not follow Unix fs semantics with regards to access
permissions after a setuid().

Not only that, but NFS just isn't reliable for logging and
is a very poor idea.

 Subject: Re: general/2757: writing access logs over nfs
 
 
 I have reported this to linux-kernel and since apache initially opens
 access logs as root and then fails to write to them, people on
 linux-kernel believe it is an apache problem.
 
 I have no idea either way.  I'm just reporting it to both sides for a
 developer to figure out.
 
 I understand that it may be a bad idea to do logs over nfs, but regardless
 of what is a smart thing to do, it should still work.
