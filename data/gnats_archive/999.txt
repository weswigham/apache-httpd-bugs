Uname -a: Linux poledra 2.0.30 #11 Fri May 30 17:44:03 MET DST 1997 i486 unknown
gcc version 2.7.2.1, libc 5.4.33, 80 Mb RAM, standard equipment
>Description:
I have a small CGI-program that does nothing more then display the user with a dialog box and upon receiving information places that information in a file (appended) and then displays the dialog box again. When executed, the script displays the box a first time but when submiting information (via POST), the server experiences an internal error, thus returning an errormessage. If I start httpd on a virtual terminal, I can see on stderr that the server outputs "Ouch!  malloc failed in malloc_block()". Other cgi-scripts works perfectly well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unless I have fixed it, the script is on http://poledra.coyote.org:8080/mush/send.cgi and expects a variable as a command-line argument, thus: <URL:http://poledra.coyote.org:8080/mush/send.cgi?2>.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure you are using 1.2.1?  The server you list
reports it is 1.2b1, which is a _very_ old beta which
should not be used; use 1.2.1.

Please try to find the minimal CGI script that causes the
error for you and send it.

Do you have any extra modules configured into the server
above those the default Configuration file includes?

State-Changed-Why:
I'm assuming that once you got 1.2.1 running it worked
fine; appeared to from here, so I'm closing out the PR.

 Guess if I am ashamed now.. :)  I thought that 'hey, thats strange. I
 just compiled it as 1.2.1, why would it report 1.2b1?' -- until I
 noticed that ./httpd and httpd gave different responses.
 
 I had an old copy lying around in the path. I'm sorry for the
 inconvenience.
