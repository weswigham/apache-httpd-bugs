State-Changed-Why:
Which platform are you on?

There's still problems with the DSO support in mod_perl on 
some platforms, so you might want to try without DSO and
see if it changes anything.

>Unformatted:
I've compiled apache-1.3.2 w/PHP-3.0.4 & mod_perl-1.15_01.
What's unusual is I start the server with no problems, but everytime
the server is started it dumps core within the root (/usr/local/apache)
directory, but the server is initialized and starts with no other problems
(From what I can see so far).

Anyway, any version of apache has never dumped core, but this is the
first time I've compiled PHP and mod_perl.  It is configured as DSO
for all objects:
                --enable-module=most
                --enable-shared=max
                --enable-module=location of php module
                --enable-module=location of mod_perl module
                --enable-shared=php3
                --enable-shared=perl

The version of Perl is 5-004.04
I planned on upgrading to the latest stable version of Perl, but I also have
to recompile/configure all modules I currently use on the server (And that's
a lot!).

Thanks for any assistance.
