>Environment:
Apache 1.2.6, GCC 2.8.1, HP/UX 10.20, JServ 0.9.11
>Description:
When passing a parameter to a JServ-managed page via GET,
with the parameter having the value %
as in, priority=%

JServ sends no output to browser, and logs the following:
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 3
        at java.lang.String.substring(Compiled Code)
        at javax.servlet.http.HttpUtils.parseName(Compiled Code)
        at javax.servlet.http.HttpUtils.parseQueryString(Compiled Code)
        at org.apache.jserv.JServServletManager.getUrlSessionId(JServServletMana
ger.java:592)
        at org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.run(JServConnection.java:287)
>How-To-Repeat:
Create form with an element sending % as value,
and GET a page through JServ.
>Fix:
Not at this time.

State-Changed-Why:

The specific query string which you presented is not
valid in an HTTP request.  In such a request, '%' must be
encoded as '%' followed by the hexadecimal value of '%'.

If you are able to produce this bug using a browser (rather
than by making the requests by hand) then please tell me
(ed@ultimanet.com).

The most recent snapshot has been changed to catch this
exception, and to throw an appropriate Exception 
(IllegalArgumentException) w/in the URLdecode method.

Thanks for the bug report.
