>Description:
I have a problem with Apache 1.3.0 and the SSIs.  I have currently have
1.3b6 running on one port and configured 1.3.0 to run on another port.
I have both webservers using the same htdocs/ directory.
The problem is Apache 1.3.0 wont parse the SSIs, the error_log gives:

[Thu Jun 18 12:46:41 1998] [warn] handler "server-parsed" not found,
using default handler for: /home2/yoda/sbirl/htdocs/

I compiled 1.3.0 both manually and with the script, made sure that
mod_include was complied, and even double-checked my config files (all 3
of them against my 1.3b6 config files)

Apache 1.3b6 parses the SSIs correctly, but 1.3.0 refuses.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://yoda.cis.temple.edu:8888/  (Apache 1.3b6-- which parses SSIs)
http://yoda.cis.temple.edu:8050/  (Apache 1.3.0-- which doesnt)
>Fix:
Ive tried everything I could think of-- no suggestions I can think of.

 Do you have an Options directive that has "Includes" in it?
 
 Does it cover the directory in questino?

 Yes.  I double checked the all 3 of the .conf files.  I originally had 
 Options All set, but change it to make sure that Includes was in there
 (just in case).  Still nothing.
 And as I said before, I checked the conf files from 1.3b6 to make sure
 I didnt look anything.
 
 taken from my access.conf file:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
 
 <Directory @@ServerRoot@@/htdocs>
 
 # This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
 # "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".
 
 # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
 # doesn't give it to you.
 
 #Options All
 Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
 
 # This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
 # override. Can also be "All", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo",
 # "AuthConfig", and "Limit"
 
 AllowOverride All
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 and my httpd.conf file has the ServerRoot definition:
 ServerRoot /home2/yoda/sbirl/
 
 
 And /home2/yoda/sbirl/htdocs is the directory that both Apache 1.3.0 and
 Apache 1.3b6 are assigned to.
 
                                                       Thanks

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 If this is still in your access.conf you've not installed
 Apache correctly.
 The path argument of the Directory directive should match
 your real document root path, e.g. /usr/local/apache/htdocs.

 I've met with the same error. Apache 1.3.0 - 1.3.1
 
 And I think that all is ok:
 
 This is my index.shtml file:
 <!--#exec cgi=3D"/path/to/my/script" -->
 
 Of course, I've compiled de mod_include module:
 
 aragorn# ./httpd -l
 Compiled-in modules:
 [...]
   mod_include.c
 [...]
 
 Config files:
 
 DirectoryIndex index.html index.shtml index.htm home.html
 
 # To use server-parsed HTML files
 AddType text/html .shtml
 AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
 
 Sincerely, thanks in advance,
 =09Carlos.

 You have almost certainly forgot, like the previous poster forgot, to
 enable the Includes options for the directory in question.
