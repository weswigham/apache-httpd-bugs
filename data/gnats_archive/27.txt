DEC OSF/1 3.0b, gcc, etc. 
>Description:
When running the ./Configure script, it calls ./helpers/PrintPath -s
Here's what happens from manually running PrintPath:

(the.link.ca)/usr/users/kirk/archive/apache_1.2b1/src/helpers # ./PrintPath -s gcc
swap space below 10 percent free
Unable to obtain requested swap space
Unable to obtain requested swap space
./PrintPath: no space

When running the Configure script, get this error 3 times (while looking for
compiler), then exits due to unable to find compiler.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I manually edited the Configure script - commented out spots calling PrintPath
and manually setting the appropriate variables (gcc, ranlib, etc). Configure
then ran without difficulty, and make seems to have made a working binary
