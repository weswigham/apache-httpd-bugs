>Organization:
>Environment:
Most Unix systems
>Description:
Previous distros (< 1.3.22) had the line:

Group #-1

in httpd.conf-dist. On "make install", this gets substituted by the 
top-level Makefile using the command:

sed -e 's;Group #-1;Group $(conf_group);' \

where $(conf_group) = nobody so that in the final installed httpd.conf, you have:

Group nobody

In apache_1.3.22, in httpd.conf-dist, the line has become:

Group "#-1"

but in the Makefile, the sed command has not been altered. Therefore, it 
doesn't match and no substitution is made. We then get, in httpd.conf:

Group "#-1"

and when starting the server, you get the error:

[alert] (22)Invalid argument: setgid: unable to set group id to Group 4294967295

>How-To-Repeat:
Try a vanilla install with no modifications and see.
>Fix:
Change the line in the top-level Makefile to read:

sed -e 's;Group \"#-1\";Group $(conf_group);' \

To be exact, it's a large extended line but if you search for "Group" after
the install-config target, you'll find it.

 Greetings,
 
 I discussed this bug on the apache users mailing list
 (users@httpd.apache.org) and Ken Coar has indicated that he has fixed it
 in the source.
 
 So it is probably already obsolete (although it will need a new
 distribution to clear it up).
 
 Rgds,
 
 Owen Boyle.
