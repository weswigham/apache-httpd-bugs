>Environment:
Linux (kernel 2.0.32, RedHat 4.2); gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
ProxyPass works beautifully for me.  Or at least it did until starting working
with a page that contained a specific image:

  http://www.stg.brown.edu/homehead.gif
>How-To-Repeat:
Just add a pass-through proxy server to httpd.conf:

  Listen 1442
  <VirtualHost your.host.name:1442>
  ...
  ProxyPass / http://www.stg.brown.edu/
  </VirtualHost>

Then attempt to fetch:

  http://your.host.name:1442/homehead.gif

I cannot reproduce this problem with Apache, as distributed by RedHat.  I'm
only getting the problem with Apache-1.2.4 plus Ben's SSL patches, compiled
on a RedHat Linux 4.2 (+ gcc 2.7.2) system, with a few extra modules compiled
in (pam, db_auth, info; EXTRA_LIBS=-ldb -lpam -lpwdb -ldl).
>Fix:
I have no clue yet.  It took me hours of debugging just to figure out that
this image was the problem.
