>Description:
I upgraded from Apache/1.3.6 (Unix) mod_perl/1.19 to
Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) mod_perl/1.21. I installed mod_perl
and Apache the same way as the previous version.
mod_perl is linked with DSO.

Now the server doesn't start up. It does not give me ANY
error message, not on the command prompt and not in the
log files. When using 'apachectl start' it says
'apachectl start: httpd started', but it didn't start.
I finally got it to start by removing a
PerlRequire statement from httpd.conf. Then I found
that it also starts with PerlRequire when the required
file doesn't contain any 'use MODULE' statements.

Also I recompiled apache 1.3.9 with the previous
mod_perl I had (1.19) which did not change any of the
behaviour. So I conclude that the problem is somewhere
in apache.

The Perl-required script works fine with the previous
apache version.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's how I compiled:
           $ cd mod_perl-1.21
           $ perl Makefile.PL \
               APACHE_SRC=/usr/lib/apache_1.3.9/src \
               DO_HTTPD=1 \
               USE_APACI=1 \
               PREP_HTTPD=1 \
               EVERYTHING=1

           $ make
           $ make test
           $ make install

and then

    $ cd apache_1.3.9
    $ ./configure \
         --prefix=/usr/lib/apache_1.3.9_bin \
         --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
         --enable-shared=perl \
         --enable-module=most \
         --enable-shared=max
    $ make
    $ make install
>Fix:
Unfortunately no.

Try with a 5.5.3 perl instead of 5.4.5.

We also need a stack trace etc to help you. Please see the SUPPORT

 Additional info:
 
 I installed a new linux box with RedHat 6.1 Apache 1.3.9 mod_perl 1.21,
 perl 5.00503 and I have still the same problem.
 
 But I noticed another thing. I PerlRequire a script called
 startup.pl and in there I 'use' other modules. If the
 first use statement is:
 
 use DBI ();
 
 then the httpd core dumps and the backtrace looks like:
 
 #0  0x4031e3df in boot_DBI () from
 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/i386-linux/auto/DBI/DBI.so
 #1  0x403e9306 in Perl_pp_entersub () from
 /usr/lib/apache/modules/libperl.so
 #2  0x4041317d in Perl_runops_standard () from
 /usr/lib/apache/modules/libperl.so
 .
 .
 .
 
 so now it seems boot_DBI () is the problem,
 but if I remove the use DBI () I get again
 boot_Socket () on top of the stack !!
 
 Hope that is some useful information !

 There are two workarounds for the problem.
 
 1) Link mod_perl statically (Rene Seindal)
 
 2) Use mod_perl as DSO and in the configuration 
    file (httpd.conf) move the LoadModule and AddModule
    directive for mod_perl to the top.
    This is the simplest solution and I didn't observe
    any problems with it. 
 
 I hope that will be useful.
