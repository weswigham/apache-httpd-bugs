	That's cool.  I'm just not getting a clear picture of what action
	would have resolved this "bug".  At some point the doc that is in
	httpd.conf file (which is at risk of being out of sync with the
	master doc as it is) must merge back into the master documentation.
	The choice to merge back near the root seems the safest bet.

I think that the httpd.conf in release 1.3.6 is for the most part self-explanatory.
I also think that the reference to online docs and specifically direct reference to
<URL:http://www.apache.org/docs/> can be deleted.  With this action either provide 
a brief explanation of the differences between inetd and standalone as ServerType
options or delete the option of inetd as a ServerType altogether.  After all, like
srm.conf and and access.conf, is the option inetd as a ServerType needed?
