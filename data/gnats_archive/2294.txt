>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0, FP3 using the binary Apache 1.3b7 release for Windows
>Description:
I found that in going from the 1.3b6 to 1.3b7 for Windows binary release
my perl scripts weren't returning the environment variable values. These
include REMOTE_ADDR, REQUEST_METHOD for certain. Using 1.3b6 the
REQUEST_METHOD is found and the script runs, using 1.3b7 the script error
kicks in and says that requests must be of POST or GET. The best I can tell
is that there is no value in REQUEST_METHOD. When I tried to display the
REQUEST_METHOD it was empty.

Thanks!

State-Changed-Why:
In 1.3b7 (Win), we created CGI processes using native NT calls rather
than posix calls.  The env list for the Posix call is an array of NULL
terminated strings. The env list for CreateProcess must be a
NULL terminated block of NULL terminated strings. Missed this
in the original work.

Testing the fix now. A PATCH should make it to the development
list later today..

State-Changed-Why:
A fix for this has been committed to the CVS tree - sorry
about letting this slip through.  This should be fixed in
1.3b8 when it's released.  If you have a compiler and want
to try a patch, look at

http://www.apache.org/websrc/cvsweb.cgi/apache-1.3/src/main/util_script.c

For a fix to this.

Thanks for using Apache!
