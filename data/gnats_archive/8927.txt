Apache 2.0.28 and 2.0.29-dev from CVS on 29-Nov-2001.
>Description:
If I output the value of one of the date-containing SSI variables (like e.g. LAST_MODIFIED) via the SSI command #echo var="..", their value is screwed up, either containing binary garbage or (truncated) content of other CGI/SSI variables like e.g. PATH. The same values also appear in an environment dump via the SSI command #printenv. See first example URL.

Another phenomenon, I discovered is, that the values of those variables may screw up after a SSI #printenv call, even if they weren't screwed up before. See second example URL.

Hint: I discovered this problem first after upgrading from 2.0.16 beta to 2.0.28 but I'm not really sure, if the problem was already there in 2.0.16.
>How-To-Repeat:
Due to discovering the bug while trying to find out more details about PR#8772, the demo pages are at http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/8772-2.shtml and http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/8772-3.shtml. The initial bug report also shows this phenomenon: http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/8772.shtml.

The sources of these SSI pages are also available there. See the bottom of the mentioned pages.
