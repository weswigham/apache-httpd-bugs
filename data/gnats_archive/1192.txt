>Description:
Processes are showing up as "defunct" with a parent process of an Apache child
process.  Subsequent process lists (at five second intervals) show that most
defunct processes disappear and do not zombie - further investigation shows that
most zombie processes die within a few minutes or hours.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Ideally, Apache should run in such a way as to not cause the OS to think of a
process as "defunct."  (Yes I realize we should probably try upgrading the
server, however, our customer has not authorized that action)

State-Changed-Why:
Apache prunes dead httpd children every second unless you've played
with the source in http_main.c.  Dead CGIs are pruned when the request
is finished -- i.e. done sending results to the client and done
logging.  It's likely that you have a bunch of short-lived CGIs
which generate a large amount of output which takes time to
output to the client ... or that you've got some really badly
connected clients and they're sticking around until the Timeout
setting (default 20 minutes).

In any event this sounds like normal behaviour for Apache.
