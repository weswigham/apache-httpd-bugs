>Organization:

>Environment:
SunOS 5.7 sun4m sparc
>Description:
The static struct tm* returned by localtime cannot be reused
with strftime and other functions on solaris 2.6 and 7. The
autoindex module offers an easy way to check for this bug.

Please notice that varous solaris programs (e.g. FileManager)
behave that wrong way. The time displayed is 1/1/1970 with
solaris 2.6 and the current date with solaris 7. (I don't
know about 2.5 and 8, it was NOT there in 2.4.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Point your browser at a directory to be listed by autoindex
that contains some file older than today and check the output.
>Fix:
/* in ap_config.h: */

static struct tm* my_localtime(time_t const *clock) {
   static struct tm my_tm;
   return memcpy(&my_tm, localtime(clock), sizeof my_tm);
}
#define localtime(X) my_localtime(X)

/* I did the same with gmtime.
**
** Alternatively, one may experiment with localtime_r, gmtime_r
*/
