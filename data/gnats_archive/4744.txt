>Description:
I don't want hostnames resolved for the access log, so I commented out the default
'HostnameLookup on' line (I also tried changing on to off).  This works fine for
general hits to the server, but any access of /server-status/ (using mod_status)
causes a lookup:

199.172.48.67 - - [20/Jul/1999:12:27:33 -0400] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 7320
kenny.chrysalis.com - - [20/Jul/1999:12:27:43 -0400] "GET /server-status/ 
HTTP/1.0" 200 2591
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure mod_status to be used for some URL, and turn hostnamelookup off.  Visit
the status page, and any other URL on the same server.

State-Changed-Why:

Do you have your /server-status Location protected by
something like "Deny from all","Allow from .kluge.net"?
If so, that's the cause -- on name-based access
restrictions, Apache *always* does a double-reverse
lookup, which will result in the client name being stored
in the appropriate structures and hence available (and
used) for logging.

 Er, no.  The whole point of "HostNameLookups Off" is to avoid
 the netweork traffic of back-and-forthing with a nameserver
 just to provide a name that has low integrity in any case.
 Log processing scripts should either be able to deal with
 either a name or an IP address.. or else you should make
 your own log format string that uses "%a" instead of the
 default "%h".  See the mod_log_config docco.
 
 I can see documenting this behaviour a bit better, but not
 changing it..
