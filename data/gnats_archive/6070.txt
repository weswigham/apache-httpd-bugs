>Release:        1.3.9
>Organization:
>Environment:
SuSE Linux 6.3
>Description:
The #commented docu about DocumentRoot in the 'default' httpd.conf
describes DocumentRoot as:
===
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
===
This is not entirely accurate imho, because (at least on SuSE Linux 6.3)
symlinks are _not_ followed by default, because of a:
<Directory />
    Options -FollowSymLinks ...
...
</Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A.
>Fix:
I would change the phrasing to:
===
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory.
# Symbolic links, unless disabled by a 'Options -FollowSymLinks', and
# aliases may be used to point to other locations.
===

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Fri Sep 15 11:56:54 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
The basic apache distribution does allow symlinks
in the document root, so SuSE must be modifying
their configuration without changing the comments.
