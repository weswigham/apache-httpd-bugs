The AcceptFilter directive was added to the Apache Documentation without it actually being added to the Apache source for 1.3.20 (latest release according to the site).

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#acceptfilter
>Fix:
Note on the documentation when this directive first appeared, or just remove it.
