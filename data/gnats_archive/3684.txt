Is this because we're on AIX4.3?

 Huh?  You just said you were trying to compile it.  In which case,
 download the source and try compiling it.

 If you can't read the docs, then we really don't have the resources to
 step you through everything that they tell you.  By running "configure"
 you are starting the process of compiling it.  It makes no sense to say "I
 don't want to compile it but it hangs in configure".

 Ok, I think we're at crossed wires here. I downloaded the binary of 1.3.1 -
 the latest available in binaries - and the docs (INSTALL) told me to run
 ./configure -prefix etc. Because I'd downloaded the binary release I assumed
 this procedure was just to compile some small component of Apache and not
 the entire product which I assumed was already compiled. So the confusion
 seems to be that you've distributed the normal source releases in your
 'binaries' directory.
 
 So are you saying that if I download 1.3.4 'source release' then all I have
 to do is run ./configure -prefix etc?
 
 Also, do you happen to know if AIX4.3 is supposed to work or would I be just
 wasting my time with that.
 
 thanks.
 
 Don.

State-Changed-Why:
Yup you should just be able to download a source release
and do "./configure --prefix=foo" and "make".
