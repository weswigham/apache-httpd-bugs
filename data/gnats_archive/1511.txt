Comment-Added:
In fact, the path can either be absolute, or relative to the
server root, but there was a bug in the Windows version, which
is now fixed. The documentation needs updating, too.

State-Changed-Why:
The documentation has been corrected to reflect the
absolute-or-ServerRoot-relative nature of the AuthUserFile
and AuthGroupFile directives.  Thanks for using Apache!
>Unformatted:
>The AuthUserFile directive sets the name of a textual file containing the list of users and passwords for user authentication.
>Filename is the ABSOLUTE PATH to the user file.

This statement is incorrect 
The path must be  RELATIVE to ServerRoot. EG :
AuthUserFile c:/apache/conf/htpasswd -----> DOES NOT WORK
AuthUserFile conf/htpasswd           -----> IS CORRECT
