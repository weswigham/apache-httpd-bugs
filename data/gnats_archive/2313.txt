>Environment:
At least Amdahl's UTS 2.1.2
>Description:
The F_NDELAY in main/buff.c should be O_NDELAY.  This is an alternative to
turning off buffering to O_NONBLOCK.  I checked 7 different OS's and I only
saw O_NDELAY and not an F_NDELAY so I think it was just a typo.
	OS/release		   has O_NONBLOCK  has O_NDELAY
	========================== ==============  ============
	Linux slackware 2.0.32		yes		yes
	HPUX 9.04			yes		yes
	IRIX 5.3			yes		yes 
	NCR MP-RAS 4.0 3.0		yes		yes
	Solaris	5.4			yes		yes
	Sunos 4.1.2			yes		yes
	UTS 2.1.2			no		yes

It turns out that there are a lot of other problems on UTS 2.1.2, many of
which I have already solved.  I will submit them under a separate problem
report.  In the meantime, I figured this one was independent and easy to fix.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Change the two instances of F_NDELAY to O_NDELAY in src/main/buff.c.
Alternatively, if someone thinks some system has F_NDELAY but not O_NDELAY,
add a third #ifdef option.

State-Changed-Why:
Actually it was supposed to be FNDELAY without the underscore...
I put in the three of them -- O_NONBLOCK first, O_NDELAY second,
FNDELAY third.  (patch in 1.3.1-dev)

Thanks
