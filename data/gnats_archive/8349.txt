It's not my server, so I don't know...
>Description:
This problem occured with one public server,
so I don't know configuration of it.

Sorry for this incorrect problem report,
but I think it will be more useful than nothing... Am I right?

I tried to emulate this problem on my own server,
but nothing occured.

Is it problem at all?
May be it isn't Apache?

State-Changed-When: Mon Sep 17 10:18:31 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Umh... we have no idea what this particular server admin is doing to cause this.  There are millions and millions of apache installations, and a huge number of third party modules and other code that may or may not have bugs in them.

Since you aren't running the webserver given as an example, you need to contact the webmaster there with your problem.  If there is any bug in Apache (but it almost certainly isn't, but is instead some broken third party module) then they can try to resolve it.
