>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Server with SP2
>Description:
When installing JServ for Apache on Win2k server, the default path contains long filenames,  however the installer does not properly modify the httpd.conf file for apache to contain quotes when needed etc.  This causes a "File Not  Found" when trying to access http://localhost/jserv
>How-To-Repeat:
Install win2k server, install JRE 1.3.1, JSDK2.0, Apache 1.3.20, then JServe,and try to go to the http://localhost/jserv page.
>Fix:
install the above mentioned applications without using long file names, eg "C:\Apache" for apache, "C:\Apache\JServ" for JServ, etc. I filed this as a DOC bug, because it could atleast be in the documentation as to how to set the path (the installation FAQ docs).
