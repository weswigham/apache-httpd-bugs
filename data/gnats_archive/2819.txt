>Release:        1.3.1
>Environment:
I found the error when hacking 1.3b3 on Solaris 2.6, but the same problem
exists in 1.3.1 as is obvious from a code inspection.
>Description:
get_mime_headers() in src/main/http_protocol.c can generate errors, e.g.
when a malformed header (without a colon) or when too many headers are
supplied if you have patched it against the recent denail of service attack.
In this situation, the error is collected in a buffer but the buffer is not
flushed. This is because the flushing is usually left to child_main() in
src/main/http_main.c, but child_main() only does this if read_request()
returns non-NULL, which is not the case when get_mime_headers() causes an
error.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ telnet localhost http
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.0
foo
bar
Connection closed by foreign host.
$
>Fix:
add
	ap_bflush(r->connection->client);
before the error return from get_mime_headers().

 There's a patch either in 1.3.1 or 1.3.2-dev to take care of this.  Can
 you try it against the current dev copy, you can find it at
 <ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs/>.
 
 Thanks
 Dean

 At a glance that looks happy to me.
 
 Tony.
