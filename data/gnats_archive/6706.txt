>Description:
I ran into a problem running Apache on win32 where if a CGI gets into an infinite loop of doing nothing, it never dies.  It just sits there using up resources and apache never times it out and kills it.  I ran into this through a weird problem with bugzilla.  One of the scripts sometimes gets in a bad state, and it sits there forever - and its got a file lock.  Things get even worse because every subsequent call to one of those CGIs does an infinite wait on that file lock.

To make things worse, you can't kill these processes because they are being run as Local System (to be able to function as a service).  So you have to reboot.  I could make Apache run as a different user, but then it won't run as a service so that user would need to be logged in 24/7.   I could figure out which script has the problem, and work in some sort of timeout, but I shouldn't have to.

Anyways, this is a duplicate of problems 3168, 3751, and who knows what others.  These problems are listed under versions 1.3.1 and 1.3.3, and the last modification is about 16 months ago.  I don't understand why this problem still isn't fixed in 1.3.14.  Can it be fixed?
>How-To-Repeat:
Install apache on NT.  Have a perl script that does goes into a useless loop like

#!.../perl -w

while (1) {
}

>Fix:
Recognize the CGI has timed out and kill it.

#3168 says:
Need to update Apache on Win32 to use named pipes, which 
will allow us to do non-blocking (async) I/O to CGI 
scripts. This will allow us to kill errant CGI scripts if they don't respond in a reasonable amount of time.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm closing this report as a duplicate of several other
reports.  However, you can likely look forward to the 2.0
release of Apache providing full timeout/kill support for
CGI processes.  Also, look at sysinternals.com for the
handleex utility, which -will- let you kill system processes
if you have sufficient privilage.
