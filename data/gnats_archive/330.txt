This is a DEC UNIX specific bug in the msql auth module.  I may have time to 
fix the bug.

State-Changed-Why:
Have you been able to identify the specific problem
in the mSQL auth module?  Is it related to 64bit
operations?  Does the problem still persist with
a more recent version (e.g., 1.2b10)?

Comment-Added:
This is the only report we've received of this problem.
Please go to <http://bugs.apache.org/full/330> and
review it, since this message won't include the full
case details.  Nothing has changed in the module of
which I'm aware, so I assume the problem still exists
in Apache 1.2.1, correct?  If you can give more
details about what you think the cause is, we can take
a look at it.  Otherwise, I'm going to close this
case in about a week, assuming it's been fixed somehow.

mod_auth_msql is no longer a part of the Apache distribution
as of 1.3.
>Unformatted:

Submitter also says:

Environment:
Digital UNIX all versions.
Description:
When running a busy site with a few virtual sites configured,
MSQL authentication fails.

If you hit reload many times, it may eventually succeed.
