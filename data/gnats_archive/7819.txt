State-Changed-Why:
Umh... I can only guess what you are talking about because
you only gave a very vague and short overview of your problem
without giving enough information to give us any reason to think
there is any bug here, but you should probably take a look
at the IndexIgnore directive in your file which, by default,
prevents the display of files named README* in directory
indexes.

Configuration questions like this are better asked through
proper support channels like usenet and NOT this bug reporting
database.
