>Description:
Can't create more than 128 Virtual Hosts.  The server 'hangs' when trying
to use more than 128.  Works fine with Apache 1.1.3.  There are no error
messages that we are able to find.  Server starts but doesn't answer requests.
Works fine with exactly 128 Virtual Hosts.

We adjusted the suggested performance parameters in hopes of that fixing the 
problem. We also upped the MaxClients as well.  None of those seemed to help.  
We went back to 1.1.3 and everything works fine.

Running under shell using limit <all> unlimited...
