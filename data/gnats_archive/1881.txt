>Description:
I've run several scripts that are better off with the username/groupname being the same as the user (i.e. my file upload utility or my polling program).  I've noticed that for some reason userid and groupid on each file created by the script is nobody instead of mine.  We've also got two new virtual hosts running and it says suexec wrapper is required.  I checked the httpd.h and the suexec.h files and they are set correctly.  I've also recompiled it with new *.h files and set them all correctly.  Still no cigar.  I've even disabled the user and group for the virtualhosts. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I really have no idea.  If you had access to my server, I'd be able to help you out.  Let me know if you need a special account created and I can do it, and I can give you something that will allow you to try it out for yourself.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you getting a message in your error log when you start
Apache saying suexec is enabled?  If not, you don't have
it in the right place or with the right permissions.

What uid do you think they should run as?  How are you
setting that?  Give an example URL that you think suexec
should be invoked for.

Are you sure the ownership of the files isn't left over
from before suexec?  Did you try running something that
just runs id or something to see what uid they are running as?

 If it doesn't tell you it is configured for suexec, it isn't.  You had
 better double check where you have your suexec binary, that it is
 readable, executable, root owned, and setuid, and that it agrees with the
 location defined for it in the binary.
