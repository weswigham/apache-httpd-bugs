The result of 'uname -a' is SunOS dps-ranger 5.4 Generic_101945-36 sun4m sparc
>Description:
Configure works fine. Make does not.  I am installing in a subdirectory so that
I can try it out prior to 'real' use.  Is this possible?  The file alloc.c 
doesn't seem to want to compile.  Any ideas?

>How-To-Repeat:
Solaris 2.4
Download apache_1.3.b.5.tar.gz into a non-root subdirectory.  Then gunzip and
tar -xvf, then follow the directions in the INSTALL file.  If gcc is your 
compiler, as mine is, place "gcc" in the Configuration file, and no other 
changes.  Run Configure, which should work.  Then run make.  The alloc.c should
bomb.
>Fix:
`__builtin_va_alist' undeclared hints at a code problem.  Also, the messages 
show that an integer is being used without a pointer cast in alloc.c.  Try
checking that out first.

Thanks

 If I had to take a wild guess, which I will, you've installed a gcc which
 doesn't match the header files on solaris 2.4.  Maybe one built against
 2.5, or maybe one built against a much earlier beta version of 2.4 (there
 was a gcc binary floating around like this for a long time).
 
 This isn't an apache bug, __builtin_va_list is gcc talking to itself, and
 if it doesn't have the definition somewhere then gcc is missing or has the
 wrong header files.

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr  7 11:14:14 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Your compiler is not installed properly.  You may be using
a gcc designed for a different version of Solaris or you
may not have followed the instructions properly for installing
it.  This is not an Apache problem.

Note that if you searched the bugdb for __builtin_va_alist
you would have found another PR telling you this.
