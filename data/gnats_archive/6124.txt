Frontpage Server Extensions (Frontpage 2000)
>Description:
I added a .htaccess - file into a subdirectory of Document Root 
on a virtual server, but this file is ignored, access is still
permitted to everyone

I believe, this problem is related with frontpage on the same server.
Is there anything known...

thanks
