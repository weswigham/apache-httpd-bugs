>Environment:
Linux 2.0.36 (Red Hat 5.1), gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
In September, there was discussion of mod_log_config and some need to 
break the client request "%r" into its separate components. A patch was 
committed to the 1.3 dev tree that exposed the method and protocol 
request members as "%m" and "%H". It was noted that "%m %U %H" was not 
the same as "%r" because %U does not include query string information. 
The attached patches add support for logging query string in such a way
that "%m %U%q %H" is the same as "%r". I would like to see this committed 
to take care of the unfinished business begun with "%m" and "%H".

Thanks,

-Peter
