>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 98 - Second Edition
>Description:
Using SSIs my html has the following directive:

<!--#config timefmt="%A, %d %b %Y %X %Z"-->

This works fine on UNIX/LINUX systems with the time zone being returned as the 3 character Time Zone Code (such as GMT).
On Windows/98 it returns "GMT Standard Time" or "GMT Daylight Time"!

This causes problems with JavaScripts that process dates as JavaScripts expect the time to be in the standard form such as Wednesday, 26 Jan 2000 18:34:00 GMT 
(without the "Standard/Daylight Time" text.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following into a parsed html document and see how Windows/98 gives the wrong output causing theh Javascript to fall over:

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Test of timefmt </TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<!--#config timefmt="%A, %d %b %Y %X %Z"-->
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript" TYPE="text/javascript">
<!--   Hide from old browsers
function GMTtime(a) {
alert(a) ; //  a useful diagnostic
  if (a.substring(0,1) == "<") {return (document.lastModified) }
  GMTDate = new Date()
  milliSeconds = Date.parse(a)
  GMTDate.setTime(milliSeconds)
  return(GMTDate.toGMTString())
}

  document.writeln("Last Updated: ")
  document.writeln(GMTtime('<!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED" -->') + "<BR>")

// end hide from old browsers -->
</SCRIPT>
</BODY></HTML>

>Fix:
Strip off anything but the first word returned by windows.
Or, shoot the Microsoft developer who does not know that there is no such
thing as GMT Daylight Time - its GMT or BST (British Summer Time)!

State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:34:34 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Shooting the developer who thought zulu time observes
daylight savings time sounds about right, only if you plan
to use a James Bond style wristwatch device.

Sorry, its entirely up to the clib to do the right thing here.
