>Environment:
Linux Slackware 7.1 kernel 2.2.16
apache 1.3.12 with "include" keyword in httpd.conf file
>Description:
Hello
I want to use include keyword in my httpd.conf file to
have like include blocklist.conf
meaning a regular httpd.conf file and ANOTHER file blocklist.conf
in which there is ProxyBlock instruction.
The problem is that
in my rc.local rc.httpd is before rc.isdn
rc.httpd is starting apache server/proxy and rc.isdn is starting myISP connection
but apache want to have an active internet connection when i use "INCLUDE" keyword and because rc.isdn is not still  executed MY PROXY SERVER IS BLOCKED!!
I just tried WITH and WITHOUT "INCLUDE", it does work WITHOUT and it does not work WITH because
apache seemes to issue a connection
>How-To-Repeat:
you just creat a httpd.conf with "INCLUDE" keyword
and you run rc.httpd before any network modules, isdn connection is active!
>Fix:
I do not know
I do not understand the relations of having active net/kernel
and configuring the apache/proxy server
