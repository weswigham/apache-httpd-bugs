This problem is identical to that described in PR:2829.

Oddly enough, if 'hostnamelookup' is turned on, IP adresses that correctly resolve to a hostname will display correctly in the access log..

What may compound the problem is that the apache I'm using is compiled with PHP 3.0.2 which is in turn compiled with support for MySQL.

 Do you have another compiler (eg. IRIX cc) you could try?
 
 Did you enable any optimization (-O) settings in gcc?  If so, try
 disabling them.
 
 Could you try with an older (ie. more stable, less buggy) version of gcc?

 Tragically not. (If only SGI gave away the command line tools for free...)

 The 'OPTIM' line in each of the Makefiles is blank, so I presume thats a no.

 I originally tried to build Apache/PHP3 with gcc 2.7.2, however there were
 a number of linking problems due to the fact that 2.7.2 has no support for
 n32 binaries (or something along those lines).
 
 
 Sorry - I can't imagine this is much help.
