 I am using Win 98.  When starting the Apache demon it automatically brings
 the screen up for dialing into my Internet provider.  It will only run when
 I have a connection established, subsequently closing my internet connection
 stops the Apache web server from running,  Why can't I have Apache running
 with out being connected to the Internet?
