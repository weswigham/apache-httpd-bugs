>Environment:
Redhat 6.0 
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
Kernel 2.2.5
Pentium Pro 200mhz 128mb ram
apache 1.3.12

>Description:
What appears to be a POST related problem on apache 1.3.12 with version 4.73,
4.72 and 4.63 results in a no-content length error in the logfile and the 
browser hangs. Seems to be on Mac, Linux and Windows versions of Netscape 4.x.
However the same code works with NS 3.04 on my Linux box (described above).
No problem was detected prior to the upgrade to apache 1.3.12.

The following code was used for testing:

<HTML>
<BODY>
<FORM enctype="multipart/form-data" ACTION="upload1.php3" METHOD="POST" name="upload">
Submit <INPUT TYPE=file NAME=userfile><BR>
<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT><BR>
</FORM>
</BODY>
</HTML>
>How-To-Repeat:
See above
>Fix:
No but I shure hope you do!!

Thanks
