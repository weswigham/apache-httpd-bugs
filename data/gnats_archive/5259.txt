WINNT-SRV 4.0, German, SP6
>Description:
Apache 1.3.6 was running, after installation of Apache 1.3.9 it was impossible
to start Apache 1.3.9 as a service. I went back to Apache 1.3.6, but now it 
was not working as a winnt-service any longer, too.

Error Message: Apache on .. could not be started.
Error 1067: The process was terminated unexpectedly.

No further Error Messages or Details anywhere.

State-Changed-Why:
You really did not provide much information, but I am sure
this is a configuration problem (and this PR 
database is not the appropriate place to ask config
questions). The problem with the start menus not working
(including installing as a service, et.al) has already been
reported
