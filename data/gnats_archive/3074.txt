>Description:
While trying to make Mozilla's gzip_content_module work on my NT computer
I found gzip_content_module does not work correctly when device letter is specified.
If asked file path is "d:/apache/htdocs/index.html.gz" 
it passes "d:/apache/htdocs/d:" as a filename (which does not exists).

However "/apache/htdocs/index.html.gz" is okey.

sure, but it is in internals.

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for the bug report.
Sure enough, ap_sub_req_lookup_file was not handling
the drive letters correctly.
The bug has been fixed and code has been committed to
CVS for the file http_request.c.
You can get the fix in the next release of Apache, or the 
current CVS tree.

Thanks for using Apache.
