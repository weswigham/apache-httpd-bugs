>Environment:
Microsoft Windows NT4.0, Service Pack 3
SoftWay's OpenNT 2.1 (demo version)
compiler : Microsoft CL 11.00.7022
>Description:
I have installed OpenNT (Softway systems), which is a POSIX sub-system for NT.
It replaces Microsoft original POSIX subsystem, so I am not sure you can reproduce
easily the bug.
The matter is that, a CGI compiled for the POSIX susbystem, makes the Apache server
returning an internal error which is : Premature end of script headers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a POSIX CGI. (LINK with /SUBSYSTEM:POSIX)
>Fix:
No..
