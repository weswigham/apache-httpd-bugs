>Description:
I'm afraid this is not a bug. It's a configuration problem than I can't solve by myself.
How can I config apache (mime.types and conf files) to execute an exe file based on CGI?
It's very important for me because I need to show the datas on a Clipper database in a web page in real time.
Thank you very much for your attention.
