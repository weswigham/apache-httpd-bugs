 Update: Netscape browsers on Linux and HP/UX systems report the pages as
 delivered by Apache. I was previously mistaken that both Explorer and
 Netscape presented the wrong page.
 
 I now suspect MS Explorer 5.0.
 
 Please let me know if you can confirm the problem is with the Explorer
 browser and/or have any suggestions or workarounds, I'd appreciate it. Is
 the Explorer problem well known and would serving virtual hosts by name
 circumvent the issue?
 
 Thanks for your time and effort.
 David
