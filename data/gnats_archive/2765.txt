Linux 2.0.35 (i386), gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
I have seen the previous bug reports on suexec reporting. The error
log DOES NOT show suexec running, nor does the access log. The server
starts up, and appears to be using suexec (it creates a cgi.log as defined
in suexec.h, and an strace of httpd shows it successfully stating it), but
it does not report this anywhere.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have tried many different configurations of apache, from fresh clean installs
on machines that haven't had apache on them, to upgraded 1.2 servers, with
1.2 style heirachy - All of them do it.
