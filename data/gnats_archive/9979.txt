Installed from apache_1.3.23-win32-x86-no_src.msi
>Description:
I am attempting to write a cross-platform server push cgi program.  It works fine on Linux and Solaris (apache 1.3.2[23]).  On Win2k the data seems to be buffered until the CGI script exits.  I have implemented push.cgi in both Tcl and C.  Since I don't expect that most people have Tcl installed, the C version appears below.  It compiles cleanly with cygwin's gcc using "gcc -Wall -o push.exe push.c".  To resolve DLL hell, the cygwin DLLs were copied into the cgi-bin directory.  Also, changing term to "\r\n" has no effect.

My reference for implementing this was http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html


#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char *boundary = "FooBar";
char *term = "\n";

int main() {
    int i;
	printf("Content-type: multipart/mixed;boundary=%s%s%s", boundary, term, term);

    for ( i=0 ; i<15 ; i++ ) {
        printf("--%s%sContent-type: text/plain%s%sYou have been watching for %d seconds.%s",
                boundary, term, term, term, i, term);
        fflush(stdout);
        sleep(1);
    }

    printf("--%s--%s", boundary, term);
    exit(0);
}
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile the code above, stick the resulting .exe in your cgi-bin directory.  Be sure that windows can find the cygwin dlls if necessary.
>Fix:
Nope, but pointers to the right code to fix would help me greatly.
