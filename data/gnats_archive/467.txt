All that do not USE_xxxxx_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
>Description:
It is possible on architectures that do not USE_xxxxx_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
to freeze out some listening sockets when multiple Listen directives
are used.  The workaround is to add -DUSE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to
the EXTRA_CFLAGS line in the Configuration file.

See src/conf.h to determine if your architecture is affected.  This affects
many architectures.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The permanent fix will likely involve using non-blocking listening sockets.
But experimentation is needed to determine if it's faster to serialize
accept()s than it is to deal with potentially many EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCKs

 Addendum:  If you have problems using -DUSE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT then
 you can also try -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.

 Another addendum:  the current code requires you to have a /usr/tmp
 directory (it can be a symlink to one of your other tmp directories).

Comment-Added:
Note that other symptoms that can indicate a need to use a
serialized accept include periodic load spikes.  We are
considering using serialized accept on more architectures
in 1.2.1.

Has this been resolved by 1.3b2?

 No, it's not resolved until every host has serialized accept, or we put in
 a test for those without serialized accept... something like this: 
 
 #if !defined(USE_xxx_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT) && !defined(USE_yyy_SERIA...
     if (listeners->next != listeners) {
 	aplog_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_NOERRNO|APLOG_CRIT,
 	    "you cannot use multiple sockets safely on your system,"
 	    " proceeding anyway");
     }
 #endif

State-Changed-Why:
As of 1.3b3 Apache will warn when this bug may manifest itself.
The user then can either work around it by using only single
Listens, or by supplying the appropriate serialization directive
as documented in src/PORTING.
