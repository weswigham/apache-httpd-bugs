mod_ssl is installed.
>Description:
I want to force a redirection and add extra headers.  I have configured the
following:

<VirtualHost 1.2.3.4.>
ServerName      redirect.this.com 
ServerAdmin     blah@this.com
Header          set "X-Something" "value"
RedirectTemp    / https://sub.this.com/ 
#DocumentRoot   /home/httpd/htdocs
</VirtualHost>

The header does not appear in the 302 response.

If I comment out the RedirectTemp and uncomment DocumentRoot, the header
appears in the 200 response.  Changing the module load order does not resolve
the problem.
