The error message given when a DLL can't load is insufficient.

Here's the fix: remove the "- len" in the last line of this code snippet

in util_win32.c

API_EXPORT(const char *) ap_os_dso_error(void)
{
    int len, nErrorCode;
    static char errstr[120];
    /* This is -not- threadsafe code, but it's about the best we can do.
     * mostly a potential problem for isapi modules, since LoadModule
     * errors are handled within a single config thread.
     */
    
    nErrorCode = GetLastError();
    len = ap_snprintf(errstr, sizeof(errstr) - len, "(%d) ", nErrorCode);


len is initialized to non-zero before it's used here (e.g. -123451) causing serious issues :-)
