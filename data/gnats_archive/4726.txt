>Description:
The %Y fix I originally gave in PR4523 had to be dropped due to %Y
not being universal :( This lead to a rather icky fix which involved
doing a %y and if the year was <70 then it was assumed to be after 2000, if
not then it was assumed to be during 1900. A better fix is below
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Replace the code

        $year=`date +%y`;
        chomp($year);
        $year += ($year < 70) ? 2000 : 1900;
        $date = $year . `date +%m%d:%H%M%S`;
        chomp($date);
        ($day,$time)=split(/:/,$date);

With:

        @tl=localtime($^T);
        $time=sprintf("%02d%02d%02d",$tl[2],$tl[1],$tl[0]);
        $day=sprintf("%d%02d%02d",$tl[5]+1900,$tl[4]+1,$tl[3]);

This has the advantage of not only removing the Y2K kludge, but also removes
two calls to the date command and does the job in a smaller amount of code.
