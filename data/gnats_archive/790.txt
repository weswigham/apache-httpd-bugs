If a URL with only a machine name is specified (for example, http://scunk/Building2/)
the default domain name of the server is not added before VirtualHost sections are
searched.

This results in a number of errors, the most visible occuring with Aliases

For example,

<VirtualHost scunk.pdd.3com.com>
  ServerRoot /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs
  Alias /Building2/ /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/Projects/Building2/
</VirtualHost>

with the above URL does not map correctly but returns a 404 error 
(as .../htdocs/Building2/ does not exist)
>How-To-Repeat:
See above
>Fix:
Adding 
  ServerAlias machine 
to each 
  <VirtualHost machine.dom.ain> 
section will fix this

But seems something of a nasty hack!

State-Changed-Why:
Nothing can be done about this inside apache.  The client is
responsible for sending the hostname part of the URL and the
standards actually dictate that it send exactly what you're
seeing.  You've got one workaround already ... another would
be to use mod_rewrite tricks to cause the server to issue
redirects to the full url.

Thanks for using Apache!
