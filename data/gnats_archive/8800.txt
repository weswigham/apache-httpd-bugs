 Cannot get apache 2.0.28 to work with SSL
 
 That's what I did:
 1) Installed apache 2.0.28
 2) started apache using ".../apache2/bin/apachectl startssl
 3) could not generate test ceritificate as per doc "make certificate"
 4) generated a test certificate using "make_dummy_cert" script that
 comes with OpenSSL
 5) changed <apachehome>/conf/ssl.conf file accordingly, I think
 6) Apache does not appear to be listening on port 443.
 Telnet localhost 443 results in "Connection refused".
 7) There are no error messages in the error_log.
 
 Thanks

  "could not generate test ceritificate as per doc "make certificate""

This isn't supported.

  "Apache does not appear to be listening on port 443.
 Telnet localhost 443 results in "Connection refused".

Sounds like you simply didn't configure the listener; Apache
would answer and error out if that port was listening but
not listening with SSL.

This is a basic question that should be taken up with the
peer support lists, not the bug reporting page.
