>Description:
mod_auth_dbm tries to be too smart and appends .db to your authdatabase filename.
>How-To-Repeat:
install apache with mod_auth_dbm
>Fix:
DOCUMENT that if you authenticate with AuthDBMUserFile that apache does NOT look for thefile you name but [your file].db
this wasted hours of my time and it. Even better, make apache read the file the user specifies and dont' magically append file suffixes.

State-Changed-Why:

I am not an expert in this area, but if you look at the
mod_auth_dbm code, you will see that Apache passes the
exact contents of the AuthDBMFile directive to the
dbm_open routines.  It is the dbm libraries on your
system that decide how exactly that maps into a filename.
You can usually find more information about how your
operating system deals with this using "man dbm_open".
In general, there is not a problem because whatever
method you use to create the dbm file (eg dbmmanage)
should use the same dbm_* calls, and therefore map to
filenames in exactly the same way.  Problems do arise
when apache and the dbm creator use conflicting libraries.

Unfortunately, it is necessary to have some knowledge about
how your system handles dbm files in order to make use
of mod_auth_dbm.  Because of the different ways different
systems handle this, it would be impossible to document
all the possibilities.  The documentation could certainly
use improving, so if you have any specific suggestions, 
please feel free to let us know.

Thanks for using Apache!
