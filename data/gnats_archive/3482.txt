>Description:
The RLimit* directives call setrlimit() in call_exec() which is really strange.
Why would you want to call them there? They should be called in child_main().
I see from PR#783 that someone agrees with me but the patch never got
applied it seems.

My particular gripe is that my server is saying 'failed to spawn child process'
(which is a really unhelpful error message as it doesn't include the errno).
I eventually discovered that this was because of RLIMIT_NPROCS. (Yes, I guessed
this earlier so I put RLimitNPROC in my configuration, but the problem is only
intermittent and it took me a while to figure out that this hadn't fixed it,
and then *why* this hadn't fixed it.)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
At the very least the documentation needs to be fixed, since at least for
RLimitNPROC it is just plain wrong, and for the others it is very misleading.
But the much preferable alternative is to move the setrlimit calls to
child_main() where they make much more sense. Having a RLIMIT_NPROC for some
processes owned by a user (i.e. CGI scripts) being different for that of other
processes owned by the same user (i.e. httpds) is a really broken situation.)

The other thing mentioned in PR#783 (not being able to decrease the hard limit
if not root) also needs fixing and is trivial, but I don't care about that
personally ;-).

Comment-Added:
No, they are the way they are on purpose.  The idea is that
user written code shouldn't have certain limits, but it
doesn't necessarily make sense to impose those same limits
on Apache processes.

This should be better documented and there should be a way to
put limits on the Apache child processes.  For memory limits,
you can just do the ulimits before starting the parent, but
that doesn't work for CPU limits since then the parent could
eventually be killed.

I think a module that can set the ulimits when each child
starts is probably the easiest solution; I probably need one
for something else anyway, so I'll look at making one and
perhaps including it with Apache.
