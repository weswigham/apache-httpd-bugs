>Description:
This is the message that I posted to comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix :

Anybody can help to figure why Apache 1.2.5 says I can't access the default
directory file unless the user agent indicates it's complete URL
(/index.html).

I have manage a server with a virtual domain, let's say on at www.main.com
and the other at www.virtual.com:

The main files are in htdocs directory and the virtual files are in a
subdirectory named virtual.  httpd.conf contains the virtual host
definition as follows.

<VirtualHost www.main.pt>
ServerName www.main.pt
DocumentRoot /apache/htdocs/
TransferLog logs/main-access_log
ServerAdmin webmaster@main.net
ErrorLog logs/main-error_log
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.virtual.com>
ServerName www.virtual.com
DocumentRoot /apache/htdocs/virtual
TransferLog logs/virtual-access_log
ErrorLog logs/virtual-error_log
ServerAdmin webmaster@virtual.com
</VirtualHost>

access.conf contains the definitions as follows.

<Directory /apache/htdocs/>
AllowOverride FileInfo Indexes
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory /apache/htdocs/virtual>
AllowOverride FileInfo Indexes
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>

The main .htaccess file is defined as follows:

DirectoryIndex frames.html index.html
<Files *>
deny from all
</Files>
<Files virtual/*>
allow from all
</Files>
<Files ~ "(index|frames|access_error)\.html">
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php3
allow from all
</Files>
ErrorDocument 403 /access_error.html?error=403
ErrorDocument 404 /access_error.html?error=404

The virtual .htaccess file that ins in virtual subdirectory is defined as
follows:

DirectoryIndex index.html
<Files ~ "(index|error)\.html">
allow from all
</Files>
ErrorDocument 403 /error.html
ErrorDocument 404 /error.html

What happens is that if the user agent asks for http://www.virtual.com/
Apache serves the error.html document.  But if the user agents asks for
http://www.virtual.com/index.html it serves index.html file ok.

I also discovered that if I remove the lines in main .htaccess file that say

<Files *>
deny from all
</Files>

accessing http://www.virtual.com/ works fine serving index.html as desired,
but I can't remove those lines or else the server will let any private
files not meant for public access to be reachable.

Anyone has any idea of why this is not working?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try http://www.mastmix.com/ .  It should appear the same page as
http://www.mastmix.com/index.html but it appears as
http://www.mastmix.com/error.html .

>Fix:
no.
