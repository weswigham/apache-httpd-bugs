>Description:
- Compile mod_jserv as per DSO instructions.
- Do a make ; make install
- Do a make clean to try another compile
- Do a make ; make install

make install fails as follows:

Making install in conf
make[1]: Entering directory `/opt/local/sources/apache/ApacheJServ-1.1b3/conf'
make[2]: Entering directory `/opt/local/sources/apache/ApacheJServ-1.1b3/conf'
/bin/sh ../src/scripts/build/unix/mkinstalldirs /opt/local/apache/conf/jserv
 ./save-install.sh -m 644 ./jserv.conf /opt/local/apache/conf/jserv/jserv.conf
/bin/sh: ./save-install.sh: No such file or directory
 ./save-install.sh -m 644 ./jserv.properties /opt/local/apache/conf/jserv/jserv.properties
/bin/sh: ./save-install.sh: No such file or directory
 ./save-install.sh -m 644 ./zone.properties /opt/local/apache/conf/jserv/zone.properties
/bin/sh: ./save-install.sh: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** [install-sysconfDATA] Error 126

make[1]: *** [install-am] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/opt/local/sources/apache/ApacheJServ-1.1b3/conf'
make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
Exit 2

It seems that the script that is supposed to handle saving the original config is
broken or missing.
