>Description:
After discovering someone was able to bring one of my servers down, by continually
clicking on a button that launches a perl cgi program (thus starting several perl
sessions on the server, and brining the load up over 75+), I started to research
how to solve this problem.  After seeing that I could set RLimitNPROC in a 
server config file, I set it to "RLimitNROC 2", just to test it.  I was still able
to launch numerous cgi scripts by performing the Denial of Service method explained
above.  I also tried "RLimitNPROC 2 3" and the same thing happened.

Am I missing something here?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Adding a header to each of my cgi scripts that first checks to see how many instances 
of the script are already running, and not executing the script if the limit is reached.
