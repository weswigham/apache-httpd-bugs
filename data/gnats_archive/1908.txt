Comment-Added:
Actually it still doesn't do the right thing even when
"UseCanonicalName on" is used.  It will in the next beta.

State-Changed-Why:
A clear sign that I should just go to sleep right now.  I
changed my mind, and added this note to the mod_log_config
docs.  I'm putting this back to analysed for now in case
someone else disagrees with me.

Note that the canonical <a href="core.html#servername">ServerName</a>
and <a href="core.html#port">Port</a> of the server serving the request
are used for <code>%v</code> and <code>%p</code> respectively.  This
happens regardless of the
<a href="core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</a> setting because
otherwise log analysis programs would have to duplicate the entire
vhost matching algorithm in order to decide what host really served
the request.

 You can close this report. The change in the documentation
 (http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html; "Note that the
 canonical ...") is fine for me.
