>Description:
	You say:

If when you run httpd it complained about being unable to "bind" to an address, then either some other process is already using the port you have configured Apache to use, or you are running httpd as a normal user but trying to use port below 1024 (such as the default port 80).

	'use port below 1024' should be
	'use a port below 1024'.
