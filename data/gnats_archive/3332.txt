>Description:
the IANA has approved a new MIME type for the 3DML format. it is an open markup 
language for typing in 3D pages, produced by Flatland Inc. - if you are not familiar the IANA now encourages the use
of type/vnd.company.subtype instead of toplevel MIME types.

Please add:

text/vnd.flatland.3dml

Brian B. encouraged me to submit this as a change request since he is traveling
the next two weeks.

State-Changed-Why:

1. Can you send the address of a document showing the
   approval?
2. Is there a canonical file extension for this IMT?
   I.e., HTML has .htm and .html, JPEG has .jpeg and .jpg,
   and so on.  What is/are the extension/s for 3DML?
