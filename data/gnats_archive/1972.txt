>Description:
In certain cases, it is useful to pass the HTTP auth information to a CGI.
This would allow the CGI to perform authentication without blindly trusting
its environment.  This is highly desirable for setuid CGI scripts which could
be execced in a doctored environment from a compromised httpd account.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
new directive:

<Directory /home/httpd/cgi-put/put.perl>
PassAuthPassword 5
# passes the HTTP Auth password (if present) in on descriptor 5
</Directory>

  I'm not sure if there's a better choice than Directory, but you get the idea.

State-Changed-Why:
In Apache 1.3 you can cause the Authorization or
Proxy-Authorization header field values to be available to
script by recompiling the server after adding
"-DSECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION" to the EXTRA_CCFLAGS
defined in src/Configuration.  This is not enabled by
default for obvious reasons.  Thanks for using Apache!
