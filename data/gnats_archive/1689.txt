In configuration both compilers are failing on TestCompile claiming that they are not
ANSI C Comiplers (I sure thought they were!)

specific errors are:
helpers/dummy.c:0: unterminated string or character constant
helpers/dummy.c:0: poaaiblw rel atrt of unterminated constant

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I really need some of the features in 1.3

Thanks in advance !!!

With a Solaris 2.6 machine

So far nothing I have tried has worked, but I have only been working on the problem for

State-Changed-Why:
What are the contents of your dummy.c file?

Are you sure you didn't add any bogus CFLAGS, etc. to the
Configuration file?

What happens if you try compiling it (eg. gcc -o dummy dummy.c)
from the command line?
