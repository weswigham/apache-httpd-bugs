uname -a says:
NetBSD sport.psc.edu 1.3 NetBSD 1.3 (SPORT) #1: Fri Jan 16 15:15:45 EST 1998     ksulliva@pit.psc.edu:/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/SPORT i386

Standard configuration with AFS (a much-improved NFS) added.  Nothing is in AFS
though, so that's probably not an issue.
>Description:
In srm.conf, I have:
DocumentRoot /var/gnats/www
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/gnats/www/cgi-bin

If I try to access a file in /var/gnats/www/cgi-bin, the file is displayed
by the web browser rather than executed.

The access_log shows:
128.182.61.58 - - [27/Jan/1998:14:15:59 -0500] "GET /cgi-bin/pr.pl HTTP/1.0" 200
 45154

There's nothing in error_log.

>How-To-Repeat:
The URL's http://sport.psc.edu:6666/cgi-bin/pr.pl
but ther's a firewall, so you won't be able to check it.
>Fix:
I'm guessing that the server is looking at the DocumentRoot before it looks at
the ScriptAlias.  If there was a way to check the ScriptAlias first, that might
fix things.

State-Changed-Why:
Your ScriptAlias directive is in error:

   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/gnats/www/cgi-bin

Add a slash ("/") to the end so it looks like this

  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/gnats/www/cgi-bin/

and see if that fixes your problem.
