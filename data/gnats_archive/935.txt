>Environment:
Server is running on a SunOS 4.1.4 system.
>Description:
When using non absolute URL's the apache server doesn't properly deal
with cgi-bin.  IE a URL that only includes /cgi-bin/foo.cgi ends up 
being interpreted as SERVER_ROOT/htdocs/cgi-bin/foo.cgi, not 
SERVER_ROOT/cgi-bin/foo.cgi

The NCSA httpd 1.5.1 deals with this correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
create a document that uses something in cgi-bin, but don't use an absolute
URL.
>Fix:
Have the server check to see if the URL is not asolute.  If it isn't check
for cgi-bin.  If you see cgi-bin, fetch SERVER_ROOT/cgi-bin/whatever.cg

State-Changed-Why:
This sounds very much like you don't have your
ScriptAlias directives set up correctly.  To
get the behaviour you appear to want, your config
files should contain a line like this:

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin SERVER_ROOT/cgi-bin

(Substitute the actual full filesystem path
for the SERVER_ROOT label above.)

If you have this line in your configuration,
please send me your config files at
<Coar@DECUS.Org>.

State-Changed-Why:
User reports the problem was due to a missing
ScriptAlias directive.  I'll check to see that
our .conf-dist files include a sample one.
