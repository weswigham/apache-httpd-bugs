>Description:
My apache server runs, but on giving the command " GET/HTTP/1.0" in 
the telnet window (and pressing enter just once, instead of the 
recommended twice),i'm getting a message which says" connection to 
host lost". Therefore i'm not able to work on telnet at all. Please help 
me out. Reply to me at the earliest.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
After starting the apache server for windows , in the console window 
type " telnet localhost 80".Then once the telnet window opens type
" GET/HTTP/1.0 ". Press enter. ( It was at this time that i got a message 
" connection to host lost" )
