>Description:
Maybe my assumption is wrong, but I had in mind that the directive
AccessConfig used in a <VirtualHost> section overrides the default
AccessConfig directive used in the main config.

I've configured several virtual hosts on one of my web-server machines
that all use the same srm.conf, but a different access config.
Today I found out, that the default access.conf interferes in the
access configurations of all virtual hosts. This is especially true
for the Options directive, because any Options directive in a virtual
host access configuration is ignored, eg. "Options None" is ignored.

In general the virtual host access configurations are read and parsed
(as shown by mod_info) and seem to work for most directives, eg. saying
"require user foobar" works.

I verified the effect with a minimal configuration, so I don't think there's
any bug in my normal configuration producing this strange behaviour.

I marked this bug report as 'critical', because the behaviour described
above can be very critical if something like "Options -ExeCGI" is
ignored (as it was on my server, because suddenly many people on my
server where able to use CGI und SSI).

As a workaround I'm know using "AccessConfig /dev/null" in my main
server configuration and moved that config to an extra <VirtualHost>
section.

State-Changed-Why:
Do you have any <Directory> sections which apply to the cgi that's
being executed?  I've walked through the code ... and unless I
blow away all my <Directory> sections I'm having a hard time repeating
your problem.  An Options directive outside a directory section is very
weak, and is overridden by any directory/location/files or .htaccess.

 Aha!  This works with <Directory> because directories have hierarchy and
 the filename is processed one component at a time.  i.e. it matches /,
 then /usr, then /usr/local, then ... but <Location> is not like that,
 it matches them in first to last order.  The main-access.conf is merged
 into all virtual hosts at the end of all config parsing.  To "merge"
 a location section it appends the main server's on to the end of the
 virtual server's.  (Ditto for directory).
 
 It might be more appropriate for us to include the main server's location
 sections before the virtual host's.  But we have to be careful changing
 that so that we don't break people's configs.  It isn't as much an issue
 for <Directory> because of the hierarchical nature of them.  But it
 still does have an effect on <Directory>.
