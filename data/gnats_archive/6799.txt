>Description:
The mod_jserv part of apache sometimes doesn't start the Java VM.
This does NOT mean that the VM sometimes doesn't come up properly but rather
mod_jserv doesn't even try to start it.

The mod_jserv.log contains in case of failure:
-----------------------------------------------
[06/11/2000 13:13:32:319] (INFO) Apache-JServ 1rst  initialization: JVM will be started later 1 29220 29218
[06/11/2000 13:13:32:340] (INFO) Apache Module was cleaned-up
[06/11/2000 13:13:32:369] (INFO) Apache-JServ 1rst  initialization: JVM will be started later 1 29232 29220
-----------------------------------------------

>How-To-Repeat:
Try starting and stopping of apache 1.3.12 (with compiled in jserv 1.1.2)
in a loop. After every start check the mod_jserv.log for the words "Java VM spawned".
In the case of failure these words will not appear, see log in the Full Description.
>Fix:
The problem is that wrapper_spawn() (in jserv_wrapper_unix.c) uses getppid()
to find out whether it runs the first step (configuration)
or second step (when it has to start the Java VM).
Unfortunatly this information is not reliable. This is because the initial
httpd process is killed after fork by an asynchronous singal and it might
take some time before the system removes the process and the new-born httpd
process gets attached to the init pocess (with pid == 1).

The first solution is to use a different method of recognizing whether it's
the first or second step.

The second solution is to wait for the parent process to die right after it has
been sig-killed. This solves the problem in general and will prevent future
problems.

The "httpd_main.c" could be modified like:
-----------------------------------------------
	static void detach(void)
	{
		#if !defined(WIN32) && !defined(NETWARE)
		int x;
		struct timespec ____sleep;  		/* <<=== */

		chdir("/");
		#if !defined(MPE) && !defined(OS2) && !defined(TPF)
		/* Don't detach for MPE because child processes can't survive the death of
		the parent. */

		if ((x = fork()) > 0)
		exit(0);
		else if (x == -1) {
		perror("fork");
		fprintf(stderr, "%s: unable to fork new process\n", ap_server_argv0);
		exit(1);
		}

		RAISE_SIGSTOP(DETACH);

		____sleep.tv_sec = 0;			/* <<=== */
		____sleep.tv_nsec = 500;		/* <<=== */

		while(getppid() != 1)			/* <<=== */
		{					/* <<=== */
			nanosleep(&____sleep, NULL);	/* <<=== */
		}					/* <<=== */
		......
	}
-----------------------------------------------

This works on Solaris 2.6 and 2.7. Note, that you have use "-lposix4" or "-ltr"
for "nanosleep()".
