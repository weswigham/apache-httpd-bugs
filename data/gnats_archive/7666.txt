>Description:
Hi, The description of mod_expires states
<num> should be an integer value [acceptable to atoi()]

For example, I would like to write this to provide for negative expire values
make things uncacheable

ExpiresDefault "modification plus -1 hour" 

The current Apache mod_expires doesn't allow this. It output's

bad expires code, numeric value expected <num

However, it allows 
ExpiresDefault M-3600

The following tiny patch to mod_expires seems to allow the first config to happen and do the right thing

>How-To-Repeat:
In a stock Apache 1.3.19 with mod_expires enabled, the following line in the config file will not be accepted

ExpiresDefault "modification plus -1 hour"

However this equivalent version will be
ExpiresDefault M-3600
>Fix:

<         if (('-' == word[0]) || ap_isdigit(word[0])) {
---
>         if (ap_isdigit(word[0])) {
