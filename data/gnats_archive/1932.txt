This is the error that fills the error file (and the partition) at an amazing rate

A 'top' reveals...
  PID USERNAME PRI NICE  SIZE   RES STATE   TIME   WCPU    CPU COMMAND
 3097 wwwexec   18    0 1092K  548K sleep   0:09 12.65% 12.65% httpd

etc in descending order of CPU

This is the same error I reported for 1.3b3

 Yeah but there's nothing we can do without more BSDI gurus to help us...
 so you're probably going to have to ask in a BSDI newsgroup.

State-Changed-Why:
This really looks to be one of two things; either for some
reason something is munging the socket in the application,
or your kernel is broken.

Do you have any extra modules compiled in or anything
not part of the base Apache distribution?  

How easy is this to replicate?  If you setup a test
server on another port _without_ any significant 
modifications to the config files, no extra modules, etc.
can you reproduce it?

If none of the above is the problem, then it looks like 
it is probably a BSD/OS kernel bug.  We don't see this 
on other operating systems in the same manner.
