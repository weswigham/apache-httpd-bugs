>Description:
The mod_info output from the Apache site is a bit odd.  None of the
current configuration output is showing up.  If you have a look at the
Apache site version and compare it to www.vex.net/info you will see
what I mean.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I had a look at the mod_info code.  I load up the configuration with
the following bit of code:

        sprintf(buf,"%s/%s",server_root,server_confname);
        mod_info_cfg_httpd = mod_info_load_config(r->pool,buf);
        sprintf(buf,"%s/%s",server_root,serv->srm_confname);
        mod_info_cfg_srm = mod_info_load_config(r->pool,buf);
        sprintf(buf,"%s/%s",server_root,serv->access_confname);
        mod_info_cfg_access = mod_info_load_config(r->pool,buf);

server_root and server_confname are both externs from http_main.c and
then I pick out the other configuration file names out of the server_rec
structure.  

I haven't had a chance to have a good look at the 1.2-dev code, but
has something changed here?  If for example at apache.org everything
is configured in a single httpd.conf file, and the server_root or
server_confname globals are no longer set correctly, then we would see 
the effect we are seeing.  %0

Fixed in 1.2b5-dev by Ken the Rodent of Unusual Size.
mod_info.c was making the assumption that the config
files are relative to ServerRoot.  Looking at the /serv-info,
it's clear that www.apache.org's server is started with -f and
an absolute pathname.
