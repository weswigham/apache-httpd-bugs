I think this one will be platform and compiler independent, but here's uname -a:
Linux Pentium.corecom.net 2.0.30 #1 Wed Jun 4 15:02:33 EDT 1997 i586 unknown
>Description:
Httpd always says "Configuring Apache for use with suexec wrapper" on stderr.
And in inetd mode, stderr goes to the client's browser instead of a terminal.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put httpd in inetd mode and install suexec.
>Fix:
Comment out line 1453 of httpd_main.c:
fprintf(stderr, "Configuring Apache for use with suexec wrapper.\n");
and recompile.

State-Changed-Why:
Good point - but you may find we will be supporting inetd
less and less in the future, so fixing this will be low 
priority to us, particularly since the fix is 
straightforward.  Also, we plan on revamping the whole 
error logging system in Apache, but right now stderr seems
the best place to send this.
