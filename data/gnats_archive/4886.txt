Dear Sirs:

Hello, Hot summer is going on in Tokyo, Japan. 

Well, I described .htaccess file as following, Its 'order' section occurs 
HTTP 500 Server Error. 
Error occurs when Its 'order' section has space code ' ' between 'deny' and 
'allow'.

  #--- occurence of http 500 (incorrect works) ---
  order deny, allow
  deny from all
  allow from 127.0.0

  #--- occurence of http 403 (correct works) ---
  order deny,allow
  deny from all
  allow from 127.0.0

Comment-Added:

Firstly, Apache 1.2.6 is quite old, and no longer supported.
Secondly, please see the documentation for Order at
<http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_access.html#order>,
where it is clearly stated that spaces are *not* allowed.
This clarification was added to the documentation some time
after 1.3 was released, so it's not surprising that you
didn't encounter it in the 1.2.6 documentation -- it wasn't
there.

Thank you for using Apache!
