>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
UnixWare egg 5 7.1.1 i386 x86at SCO UNIX_SVR5
gcc 2.95
>Description:
After upgrade from 1.3.20 to 1.3.22 on UW 7.1.1 I was unable to start Apache. "Apachectl start" wrote message "successfully started", but httpd process died immediately writing message "No default accept serialization known!!" into error log.
>How-To-Repeat:
I guess that problem can be repeated on any UW 7.1.1 machine.
>Fix:
I fixed this problem by modification of ap_config.h. I have added line 637 with following content:

#define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

However I am not sure if this is the correct way how to fix this problem.
