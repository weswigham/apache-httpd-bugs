RedHat Linux 5.1 w/ 2.0.35 Kernel on a dual PII
gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
I've upgraded my apache from 1.2.6 to 1.3.3 and my RewriteMap mapname prg:/file...
stoped to work. Apache stopped to care about it. 

The rewrite module was configured like this:
<Virtualhost ...>
 RewriteLog  ....
 RewriteLogLevel 1  
 RewriteMap mapname prg:/file...  
</Virtualhost>

<Directory ...>
 RewriteEngine on
 RewriteRule ... 
</Directory>
 
I've discovered that Apache is not even initializing my program, until I've
moved the RewriteEngine On directive  to the <VirtualHost> definition context.
I truly don't know if this is a bug or the rewrite module is intended to  
behave like that. So far I have not found a word about this behaviour.
With the previous version of Apache I've had (1.2.6) it was working fine.

State-Changed-Why:
This behavior is documented.

From http://localhost/manual/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteEngine

Note that, by default, rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means
that you need to have a RewriteEngine on directive for each virtual host you
wish to use it in. 

Thanks for using Apache.
