# Here is my new mime.types, with comments about the changes.
# Sort order matches iana mime.types list for easy comparison.
# I am submitting an alpha sorted version as well. (see the bug report
# field (suggested fix)
#Oct 1, 2000 - carsten.klapp@home.net
# This is a comment. I love comments.

# This file controls what Internet media types are sent to the client for
# given file extension(s).  Sending the correct media type to the client
# is important so they know how to handle the content of the file.
# Extra types can either be added here or by using an AddType directive
# in your config files. For more information about Internet media types,
# please read RFC 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048, and 2077.  The Internet media type
# registry is at <ftp://ftp.iana.org/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/>.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: fanf
State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 18 18:00:28 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
I have updated our mime.types files to include the media
types that have been registered with IANA since May. I did
not use your submission directly, since it was not in the
form of the output from `diff -u` and therefore difficult to
review. I have not included the extensions or non-standard
types that you suggested partly for that reason, and also
because we are reluctant to do so.
