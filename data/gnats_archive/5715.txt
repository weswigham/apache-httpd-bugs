>Environment:
DGUX 4.x
>Description:
Binary distribution's are broken on DGUX.  install-bindist.sh sets the mode 640
on the modules in the libexec directory, but the libhttpd.ep file needs to be executable.
If it is not, apache exits with the error "Cannot execute binary file: libhttpd.ep".

When the mode is set to 750, everything works fine.  Would setting the fmode on the
libexec directory cause any problems?  If this is not a problem, a patch is attached.
