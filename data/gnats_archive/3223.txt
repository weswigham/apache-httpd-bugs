>Description:
Some cgi scripts have stopped working after 1.3b6
1.3b7 and 1.3.0 wouldn't compile.
What ever patch was made to 1.31 for Next seems to be the likely problem.
Scripts which worked with 1.3b6 and before now return 
"Document contains no data" or a blank page
Here's a simple date script which no longer works,
returns "Document contains no data"

#!/bin/sh

DATE=/bin/date

echo Content-type: text/plain
echo

if [ -x $DATE ];  then
        $DATE
else 
        echo Cannot find date command on this system.

 What does the error log say?
 
 Does something simpler like:
 
 #!/bin/sh
 echo "Content-type: text/plain"
 echo
 echo "foo"
 
 do the same thing?

 I don't get anything in the erorr log. I turned on the script log as well,
 but
 don't get anything posting there either. your script works fine.

 As soon as I add any shell commands it stops working under 1.3.3
 The two below scripts work fine under 1.2.4 and 1.3.b6
 Under 1.3.3 they return
 
 Cannot Load Address
 "Document contains no data"
 
 #!/bin/sh
 echo "Content-type: text/plain"
 echo
 cat >> EOM
 /bin/date
 EOM
 echo "foo"
 
 #!/bin/sh
 echo "Content-type: text/plain"
 echo
 /bin/ls
 echo "foo"

 Sorry
 
 One of those sample scripts I sent was wrong.
 Should have been.
 
 #!/bin/sh
 echo "Content-type: text/plain"
 echo
 cat << EOM
 testing
 EOM
 echo "foo"

 Then try gradually changing my script to look more like yours until you
 run into the one change that causes it to stop working.

 Hi all,
 
 I read your bug report in the apache bug tracking system.
 I had a similar problem with apache 1.3.2 on a next with openstep 4.2.
 
 There is one thing I found out:
 When your run apache in gdb (with -X flag), then every time the error
 occurs
 a message is printed in gdb saying 'Software Exception [some offset]',
 but
 the process continues to run (you don't get to the gdb prompt).
 In some cases (very seldom) the process stops with the same message in a
 writev()
 system call.
 I never saw such a message before. In my opinion this has something to
 do with
 an exception in the underlying mach kernel.

 Since Apple worked with you on the MacOSX port, perhaps they could fix the
 problems under NeXT/OpenStep.
