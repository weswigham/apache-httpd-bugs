>Environment:
OS2 operating system
>Description:
It is possible to create a new password file with 
'htpasswd -c test.pwd gerrit' and entering a password twice

When I try to add a user with 'htpasswd test.pwd kris'
he answers 'adding user kris' and gives me the possibility to enter
the password twice

After this he says 'Command cannot be executed a program or as a 
batch program'. This is what one sees if one enters any command he does 
not know. The user is not added.
>How-To-Repeat:
try:
  htpasswd -c test.pwd gerrit         + 2 times password
  htpasswd test.pwd kris              + 2 times password

State-Changed-Why:
Supposedly this is due to the lack of a "cp" command
on OS/2, which the htpasswd application is trying to
invoke in a child process.  Alternatives are being
examined.. what *is* the OS/2 "copy file1 to file2"
command syntax?
