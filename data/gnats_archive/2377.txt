>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
Linux 2.0.34, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
Apache 1.3.0 does not compile under Linux 2.0.34 and gcc 2.7.2.  GCC reports that dlfcn.h is not found. I did see that it was compiled under kernel 2.1.97 and gcc 2.7.2.3 by lars@apache.org for your distribution.
>How-To-Repeat:
I installed from a Slackware96 (kernel 2.0.0) distribution and then only updated the kernel to 2.0.34.
>Fix:
Do not define HAVE_DLFCN_H for Linux. If the dlfcn.h is only added for the gcc release of 2.7.2.3 then this may need to be checked for during ./Configure or  throw a message indicating that the user needs a compiler update.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Mon Jun  8 22:16:21 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is a bug in the slackware 3.1 ld.so package... it's missing
the dlfcn.h header file, even though it has a man page for the
functions such as dlopen().  Perhaps there's a newer version of
the package.

You've discovered a workaround for now... so I'm going to close
this out.  We have plans to improve the configuration mechanism,
but we certainly don't want to just disable HAVE_DLFCN_H
for linux -- it works for most distributions.

 That's cool, but it probably should be noted in the release notes somewhere.
