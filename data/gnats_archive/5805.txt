>Description:
I can't setup a virtual host. I checked all the documentations on Virtual Hosts.
In teh netowrk properties I have
Host: www Domain:lwcserve.net thus the web-site address is www.lwcserve.net - it works. My IP address is 24.13.145.19. However I would like to use a virtual host to create something like sub.lwcserve.net. Please help!

Add more Virtual Host support for Windows and COM API.
