>Description:
I like your webserver, now I wanted to something using ASP.
And Apache Web Server didn't have support for ASP, I saw that there were something called mod_perl which had support for ASP. And I got it as mod_perl was a thirdpary-software-plugin for Apache Web Server, and that you needed some ASP thing to install on mod_perl which was installed to Apache Web Server. So thats kind of hard and I didn't understand anything and didn't manage to get support for ASP in Apache Web Server. Microsoft IIS has built-in support for ASP why dont you make the same and install support for ASP?
Apache Web Server has support for SSI but it aint activated by default, why not add ASP support but dont activate it as default.

[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!

 Please, do learn to use and rely on the newsgroup:
 
   comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
 
 bugs.apache.org is provided for reporting bugs in the
 Apache server, not for configuration questions.  The
 contributors do monitor the comp.infosystems.www.servers
 family of newsgroups, so suggestions are not ignored on 
 that forum.
 
 Alternately, commercial support is available from a
 number of vendors.
 
 To your SSI question, nothing is enabled by default that
 could open or widen existing security holes.  That would
 include SSI and ExecCGI.
 
 Thank you for your interest in the Apache project.
