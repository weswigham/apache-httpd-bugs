>Description:
When do a load check, the servers are not having any trouble.
By the way, here is the limits.conf:
# prevent core dumps
*       hard    core    0
#limit user processes per user to 150
*       soft    nproc   100
*       hard    nproc   150
# limit size of any one of users' files to 40mb
*       hard    fsize   40000

Does this have to do with it?

Thanks.
