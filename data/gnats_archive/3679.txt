>Environment:
Linux Slackware 2.0.35
>Description:
I am managing a network of approx 100 Window NT machines. We have one web server 
which is the linux installed pc with Slackware 2.0.35. I have created intranet 
site pages with .jpg images. On about 75% of the pc's the images look fine but 
on the other 25% the bottoms of the images are cut off and are replaced by a
black space where the image is supposed to be. I am using Netscape versions 4.07
and 4.5. I contacted Netscape and they said it was my server. A problem similar 
mine was documented in PR#2193, but if I clear the browser cache and reload the
image it still will not appear  
>How-To-Repeat:
the images are exactly like the images on http://www.usli.com, but I have not 
been informed of any such problems 
>Fix:
I am hoping it is a apache version problem similar to PR#2193

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 15 08:03:25 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
As we clearly state before you submit a PR, we do not have
the resources to try to support obscure problems with ancient
versions of Apache.  Please use a current version.
