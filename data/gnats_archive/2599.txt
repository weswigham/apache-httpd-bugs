>Environment:
NT 4.0 SP3, MSVC 5.0 upgrade
>Description:
Trying several .dsp and .dsw files indistribution -- several .c files incl 
uri_delims.h -- which is not in distribution directory.

Also, tried running make /f Makefile.nt _apacher as 
per http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html#comp, but bombs with message
that I'm missing mdpdb50.dll (which is nowhere on my system).

Sample compile for ApacheCore.dll from inside DevStudio:

util.c
D:\apache_1.3.0\src\main\util.c(85) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'test_char.h': No such file or directory
util_uri.c
D:\apache_1.3.0\src\main\util_uri.c(400) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'uri_delims.h': No such file or directory
Error executing cl.exe.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Download apache_1.3.0.tar.gz  from http://www.apache.org/dist/
2) Install MSVC5.0 upgrade, as-is
3) open any .dsp or .dsw file, and try to build.
4) Or, try running nmake, using the command given in http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html#comp
>Fix:
1) Include missing header(s) ?

State-Changed-Why:
You have to compile the projects in the correct order. Some
files, such as uri_delims.h, are created by other programs
which are themselves compiled by separate projects. You 
should build the projects in the src/main directory first, run
the programs (use Makefile.nt to see how), then build ApacheCore,
regex and finally Apache itself. Again, use Makefile.nt to
see the full correct order.

I have no idea what mdpdb50.dll is. It is not mentioned
in any file distributed with Apache. Perhaps your installation
of MSVC is not complete?

State-Changed-Why:
You definitely are having problems with the MS compiler
either you did not install it correctly or did not complete
the install.  Please reinstall MS 5.0 completly.
Then issue nmake /f Makefile.nt _apacher
Thanks for using Apache
