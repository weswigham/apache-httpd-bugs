SCO 3.2v4.2 with SCO CC
>Description:
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/ from windows 95 IE 4.01sp1 via apache 1.3.1 as a proxy server.

Connecting without apache works; connecting via apache hangs halfway through loading the <head> part of the document.

There is no network traffic at the hang.
>How-To-Repeat:
go to http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/ via an apache proxy.
>Fix:
Don't really know why it breaks.  Maybe related to PR2385 for all I know?  Keepalives dont seem to make any difference though.

Its probably microsoft being stinky IMHO to try and make people ditch apache, to try and shown ownership of some web standards.

State-Changed-Why:
If you try to connect using a browser (even lynx...) running on the same
machine that runs your Apache proxy, does it work?

It works fine for me though an Apache proxy.

Is there anything relevant in the error log?

 When I do it from lynx I get:
 csluk.ethernet - - [17/Nov/1998:17:24:30 +0000] "GET
 http://windowsupdate.micros
 oft.com/ HTTP/1.0" 200 13434
 
 But from my PC I get:
 sam.ethernet - - [17/Nov/1998:17:25:51 +0000] "GET
 http://windowsupdate.microsof
 t.com/ HTTP/1.0" 304 -
 
 It seems as if MS server is being clever about where the request comes from.
 The next 2 lines in the access logs are:
 
 sam.ethernet - - [17/Nov/1998:17:25:52 +0000] "POST
 http://activex.microsoft.com
 /objects/ocget.dll HTTP/1.0" 404 0
 sam.ethernet - - [17/Nov/1998:17:25:53 +0000] "POST
 http://activex.microsoft.com
 /objects/ocget.dll HTTP/1.0" 404 0
 
 Which as far as I can tell is my PC snitching to microsoft about what I have
 installed.
 
 No more lines appear in the access log and no errors appear in the error
 log.
 
 The strange thing is, despite the 304 redirect the fragment of page
 available by "view source" from explorer is very similar to the "\" source
 in Lynx.
 
 Explorer works fine if it bypasses apache.  Perhaps it is an explorer only
 problem?
 
 I'll be glad to hand over any more info...

in 1.3.14.
