Here's the appropriate part of access.conf for my test machine.

<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 127.0.0.1
require valid-user
AuthName Server Status: Use 'anonymous' and your email address for access
AuthType basic                           #********
AuthUserFile conf/server-passwd          #********
Anonymous_Authoritative on
Anonymous anonymous guest
Anonymous_LogEmail on
Anonymous_VerifyEmail on
Anonymous_NoUserID off
</Location>

If either or both of the two marked lines are commented out, I get
  "access to /server-status failed for 127.0.0.1, reason: configuration error:
   couldn't check user.  No user file?"
messages in the error log.

I've done some further testing and these lines are needed *only* if they are not
otherwise defined. I tried adding them in a "<Directory />" section and it
works. My current setup did not have them. Seems like they have to be "visible"
in some way.

It's not a big deal. I just think it should be stated clearly in the
documentation.
