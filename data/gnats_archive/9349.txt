>Description:
I have the following .htaccess in my document tree:

Options ExecCGI
SetHandler cgi-script
DirectoryIndex index.pl

The intention here is to make this directory into a CGI directory, and execute index.pl if no other filename is given.
(eg http://www.foo.com/bar/ would assume http://www.foo.com/bar/index.pl)

This worked fine in Apache 1.3.12.

However, in Apache 2.0.28, I get a 403 back, and the following in my error_log:
attempt to invoke directory as script

But, if I specifically request http://www.foo.com/bar/index.pl, everything's fine.

I'm only guessing that it's DirectoryIndex that's broken, but that's really how it seems to me.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above (no, they're not real URLs, but you probably guessed that much).
>Fix:
Maybe it's intentional?  It would be nice for it to be documented, if so.  Failing that, roll back to the 1.3.12 source.  No, just kidding.
