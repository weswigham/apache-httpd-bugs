>Environment:
NT 4.0,pre-compiled
>Description:
same error as 3767.  I also tried a few other test cases.  used -d flag:

apache -d C:\lkjsadf

got an error for directory C:/lakgh...: notice how the slashes were switched.
This also happens with the -f flag.
It would appear that somewhere all of the input arguments are being parsed and
that all '\' are being replaced by '/'.  For obvious reasons this isn't so good under windows.

A co-worker told they didn't see this problem when using 1.3.9 but I haven't even
checked to see if that release exists and is stable.
>How-To-Repeat:
see PR 3767
>Fix:
Remove all command line parsing that translates '\' to '/'.  ez n'uf

State-Changed-Why:
Please update the PR with the exact error you are seeing.
Seeing forward slashes in the error messages is not a problem.

 Upgraded to beta version of Apache and everything works fine.  It seems last 
 version of this package did not correctly parse backslashes when run on WIN 
 platform.  This ticket can be closed.  Thnx for the reply :)
