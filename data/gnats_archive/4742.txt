>Description:
the result depend in the browser!!!
with Netscape, mod_rewrite does his work only if you make a reload or follow 
a link(*).
with IE5, the refresh doesn't work.
when the mod_rewrite doesn't do his work, it doesn't touch the mod_rewrite.log
file, it's not a question of false conditions/tests.
(*)a link followed worked when I used irix compiler instead of gcc compiler, so there
is a difference also between the two codes.
(Rem: I tested the same stuffs but without virtual hosts on Freebsd, and it was correct)
 
>How-To-Repeat:
in a Virtual host, I wanted a referer redirection, so I added

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mysite.com/path/.*$
RewriteRule ^(.*)  http://mysite.com/otherpath
RewriteLogLevel ....

ok, that's all
