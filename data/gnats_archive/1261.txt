FreeBSD-2.2.2 (not important)
>Description:
Suggested addition of SuppressColumnSorting option under IndexOptions. This
would suppress the new feature of automatically making links out of the column
headers in FancyIndexing listings.

I've made the changes to mod_autoindex; they're in disparate enough parts of
the (31K) file that it isn't feasible to include the full changed file unless
requested. Let me know what to do...

 Do a "diff -c mod_autoindex.c.orig mod_autoindex.c" (where
 mod_autoindex.c.orig is the copy as distributed with 1.3b2) and mail that
 output.

 Aside from the submitter's reason...
 
 Features are good to disable.
 
 You may not like robots fetching each index 8(!) times just so the user
 has the option of sorting it.  This is a problem especially since indexes
 aren't cachable.  Hmm.  This is a problem.  Check out the log for
 www.apache.org and you will see what I mean.  Perhaps a last-modified
 should be set as the modification time of "." in mod_autoindex?

A modified version of this patch that supplies the

Thanks for this report, and for using Apache!
