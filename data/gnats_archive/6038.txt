>Description:
I have the msql server running on the same machine as the apache server. When I try to create a msql database through a PHP script, I get the error message "Load of x:\...\msql.conf failed" after any other output. "x:\..." points to the PHP directory, but i am sure, that it is an apache error message, because there are no problems with the script and also the database exists afterwards, everything works fine, but it is disturbing to get this error message. There's no hint in your documentation how, where or why to create a msql.conf file...

State-Changed-Why:
Apache doesn't talk to any databases itself, period.  The database
support you are using is a PHP thing.  We can do nothing about
that, you have to contact the PHP people.
