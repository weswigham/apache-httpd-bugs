>Description:
Users home dirs are mounted on /home/username from machine:/export/home/username
when trying to access /~username and if <Directory /home> have no "AllowOverride None"
directive the server try to get /home/.htaccess (which is the correct behavior)
but fail for an unknown reason - in fact this is a known automounter pb/behavior -
 (from error_log: "[crit] (13)Permission denied: /home/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: 
unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable") so after that ALL user
stuff became unreadable. We need to allow .htaccess on ~user , is there a way 
to acheive that only w server configuration?  
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Allow AccessFileName to be specified in <Directory> so that we could do things like
<Directory /home>
	AccessFileName /dev/null
</Directory>
<DirectoryMatch "^/home/[^/]+/public_html/">
	AccessFileName	.htaccess
</DirectoryMatch>
And for security reason add a new AllowOverride directive to tell if AccessFileName
could be overriden or not.

State-Changed-Why:
The normal solution for this is to simply set AllowOverride
None for /home, then set it to whatever you want for
the directories under home.  Since AllowOverride None
makes it skip reading the htaccess file, it effectively
accomplishes the same thing that using /dev/null would.

 You can't use AllowOverride within Location sections.  Well, you can but
 it makes no sense.

 No, the whole point of AllowOverride is to say what can be overridden in
 .htaccess files.
 
 If the above doesn't work then the below wouldn't work.  Your
 DirectoryMatch exprssion for public_html is probably incorrect.
 Look closely to see if it is actually matching what you want it to
 match, and consider if /home/*/public_html would work.
