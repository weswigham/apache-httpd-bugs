>Description:
Older versions of Apache send "Last-modified:" instead of "Last-Modified:". 
The proxy module does not recognize these (slightly wrong) headers.

In the function ap_proxy_cache_update
the response headers are searched for "Last-Modified" 
using ap_proxy_get_header.

No last modified date is found and the actual date is used.

The same is true for "Content-type:" and "Content-length:"

Maybe mod_proxy should be more tolerant to the behaviour of it's ancestors :-)

make the search in ap_proxy_get_header case insensitiv

State-Changed-Why:
I'm confused. The ap_proxy_get_header function
_DOES_ match case IN-sensitive. And thus "Last-Modified"
should lookup "Last-modified" correctly.. Hmmm... 
do you have more details why you think that exactly
this piece of code causes the failure?

 You are right, everything is OK. There was an error in my test-code to
 check if a last-modified header was found. The problem I had with
 last-modified dates obviously had nothing to do with "Last-Modified"
 vs. "Last-modified".
 
 Im sorry for sending the report which was wrong. I should have looked
 into ap_proxy_get_header first but was sure my code was right.
