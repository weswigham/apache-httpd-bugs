Linux www 2.2.13 #7 Tue Feb 22 13:59:58 CET 2000 i686 unknown

gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
>Description:
I have several name-based vhosts on my machine and I've got the problem that,
if no "/" is provided after the hostname, the master-server answers the request.
Detailed:
The master server is www.wap.at
The vhost in question is www.spass.net
The browser in question is a phone.com WAP browser. Netscape seems to add the 
slash.

Of course I am not sure whether this is a bug or not, but as I didn't find an 
answer in the docs, I thought so.
>How-To-Repeat:
seemingly only possible with a WAP handy.
>Fix:
I tried to write a Translation Handler with mod_perl, but it did not solve the 
problem
