>Environment:
BSDI BSD/OS 3.1
gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
The doc (see above URL) says that one should be able to get around the
FD_SETSIZE problem by "adding DFD_SETSIZE=nnn to EXTRA_CFLAGS".  With 1.3.3,
there's no easy way to add this by hand to any of the Makefiles or Configuration
files, which is what the doc suggests.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The correct way is to set the "CFLAGS" environment variable before
running "configure".  This kind of thing is suggested elsewhere in the doc 
for other reasons.  (What I did was modify "config.status" myself, adding
the CFLAGS=""-DFD_SETSIZE=nnn" before the "./configure".

State-Changed-Why:
Incorrect, you can change the EXTRA_CFLAGS just fine if you
use the Configure interface.

If you want to use the optional and different APACI configure,
then you are stuck with having to do things a different way,
as described by the configure docs.  There are lots of places
in the docs where it tells you to change the EXTRA_CFLAGS,
rerun Configure, etc.  I'm not sure that we can really expect
every place to give instructions both for the normal Configure
and the tacked on configure.

 Thanks for pointing this out, but it's not obvious to me exactly
 where one can add more EXTRA_CFLAGS and not clobber things.

 I understand that.
 
 
 Thanks,
