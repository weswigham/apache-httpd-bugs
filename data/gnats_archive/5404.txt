>Environment:
I encountered this problem on linux 2.2.12 and apache 1.3.6, but I can also
get it to happen off of http://www.apache.org/ as well.
>Description:
Pick a URL which exists, for instance "http://www.apache.org/index.html"
and access it.

Now try a URL that doesn't exist which contains part of the previous one,
for instance "http://www.apache.org/index.html/this/should/not/work" and
access it.  My netscape brings up the apache web page with broken image links
and any CGI scripts that need to be run (none on that particular page) will
fail mysteriously as well.

I'm pretty certain this should not happen.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.  :)
>Fix:
Not really.  I tried to read the source code to apache, but there is a lot of
it so I gave up and decided to just file this bug report.

That is the correct behaviour.  When SSIs are enabled, this is a feature
that allows SSIs to use PATH_INFO to do different things.

 I forwarded this to the htdig developers, and I agree with their
 response that apache seems to be doing the wrong thing here.  If SSI's
 are turned on, and someone accidentally puts a / after an html document
 then all of a sudden all the relative URLs in that document are broken.
 
 Here is the response (snipped) from one of the htdig people back to me:

 I'm sorry, but both you and the htdig people are wrong.
 This is how Apache is designed to work, and it is working
 correctly according to its design.  The breakage of
 relative URLs is a side-effect of the algorithm browsers
 use to construct absoluteURIs from them: the algorithm
 simply backs up to the last '/', assuming it's part of
 the path.  It can't tell, and since URIs are opaque it
 shouldn't need to, whether the '/' thus found is part of
 the path or of the path-info.
 
 For what it's worth, the author of the RFC (1808)on relative
 URLs is Roy Fielding, and he's part of the Apache project
 team.
