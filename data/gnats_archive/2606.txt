SGI Challenge L
IRIX64 6.2 03131016 IP25
gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
The command /var/www/apache/sbin/apachectl start produces the following error:
semctl(IPC_SET): Bad address
>How-To-Repeat:
Start an Apache 1.3.0 httpd on a R10000 SGI IRIX box compiled with gcc.  
It should say that it has started httpd, but the logfile will report the error
above almost immediately. 

>Fix:
Have tried related semaphore and IPC-based header patches listed in the SGI
patch database w/ no improvement. Open to suggestions

 To make it work, recompile with "-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT" in the
 EXTRA_CFLAGS line of your Configuration file.
 
 That doesn't fix the problem, but does avoid it.
