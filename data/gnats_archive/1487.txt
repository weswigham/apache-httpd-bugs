The above error message occurs. IBM says it the Apache not allowing this process. 

Thanks for all your help.

State-Changed-Why:
First, v1.1 is ancient and we can't support it any more.

This is almost certainly a configuration problem.  You
probably don't have the file in question setup properly
to be parsed as a CGI, eg. no ScriptAlias for it.  You
need to configure your web server to do so.  We are unable
to help 600000 users in basic configuration issues with
Apache.

If necessary, you can try posting your problem to
the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix newsgroup.
