>Description:
I've got an environment where both /home/groups and /home/users have to appear on the root of a virtual host. To cut to the chase, I'm using mod_rewrite to do this, and it works great.
The problem, is that I'm also using mod_speling to correct mis-capitalized URI's (I just moved them from a Mac webserver that was case-insensitive to a Linux+Apache solution *cheers*).

The RewriteCond line is as follows: RewriteCond   /home/users%{REQUEST_FILENAME} -F [NC]
Below is a line from the rewrite log that "looks up" a file, and says "not matched" but the file DOES exist, it's just ending with '.GIF' instead of '.gif'
137.143.111.133 - - [25/Aug/2000:10:57:29 -0400] [www2.potsdam.edu/sid#81002dc][rid#810862c/initial] (4) RewriteCond: input='/home/users/sipherjd/gif/jdspict.gif' pattern='-F' => not-matched

I really don't think this is because I've mis-configured mod_rewrite, as it DOES do what it needs to do, it's just not ignoring the case of the files and producing a 'match' when it should.
For giggles, the relevant portions of the .conf are below.

DocumentRoot /home/managed/groups

RewriteCond   /home/managed/groups%{REQUEST_FILENAME} -F [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.+) - [PT] [L]

RewriteCond   /home/users%{REQUEST_FILENAME} -F [NC]
RewriteRule   ^(.+) /home/users$1  [L]

RewriteRule ^(.+) - [PT] [L]

>Fix:
Um, make 'NC' work? Or slap me around if it's my bad.

State-Changed-Why:

Well, it is not exactly crystal clear in the docs,
but I think this is working as intended.  The
[NC] option is used to make comparisons case-
insensitive.  It can not be used when doing a file
test, since the file system does not have case-
insenstitive comparison functions in unix.
I've clarified the documentation a little.
