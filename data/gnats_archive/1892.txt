>Description:
Apache is unable to process <!--#include virtual="test.pl?something"--> command.
This problem is relevant only to Perl scripts. If we change test.pl for DOS/Windows
binary, it works as it should. But I'm sure, this error will appear on any
#!c:\... starting scripts, so Perl itself isn't the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Conside the following script:
---------test-cgi.pl----------
#!c:\progra~1\perl\bin\perl.exe
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
foreach $key (keys %ENV){
    print "$key - $ENV{$key}<br>\n";
}

and the following HTML
-------test-cgi.html-----------
<h1>test-cgi.pl:</h1>
<!--#include virtual="test-cgi.pl"-->
<hr>
<h1>test-cgi.pl?something:</h1>
<!--#include virtual="test-cgi.pl?something"-->
-------------------------------
The result is like this:
-------------
test-cgi.pl:

SERVER_SOFTWARE - Apache/1.3b3
.......
<skipped>
.......

test-cgi.pl?something:

[an error occurred while processing this directive] 
-------------
Of couse, both includes (with or without ?somehting) work perfectly on Unix.
>Fix:
Sorry, I do not have Apache/Windows sources, but I'm sure this bug is very 
simple and easy to fix

State-Changed-Why:
There is a known bug in such things in 1.3b3; it is
fixed in 1.3b5 and later.  Give it a try when a binary
release comes out.

Thanks for the report.
