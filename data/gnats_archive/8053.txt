>Description:
The files "Configuration" , "Configuration.tmpl" and ---- have an documentation
error. In the "Module Configuration" comment in these files is explained how
modules are executed: modules are executed in reverse-priority order, later one that appear override the others... It's wrong. The modules that are added first
in the file are called later in the API hooks. It's explained properly in the
"src/modules/standard/mod_rewrite.c". Bye.
