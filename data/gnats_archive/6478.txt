>Description:
You can't! The reason is: First, case translations for arbitrary length URLs cannot be done via regex patterns and corresponding substitutions. One need a per-character pattern like sed/Perl tr|..|..| feature. Second, just making URLs always upper or lower case will not resolve the complete problem of case-INSENSITIVE URLs, because actually the URLs had to be rewritten to the correct case-variant residing on the filesystem because in later processing Apache needs to access the file. And Unix filesystem is always case-SENSITIVE. 

But there is a module named mod_speling.c (yes, it is named this way!) out there on the net. Try this one.
