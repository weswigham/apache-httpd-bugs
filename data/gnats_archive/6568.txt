>Description:
Im currently writting a request handler for apache in C. The problem I have
is that the field "unparsed_uri" in the request is exactly the same as the 
"parsed" uri, neither scheme, port, hostname, query, etc. are contained in
it. Also, the parsed_uri structure (uri_components) only contains "path", all 
other fields (scheme, hostname, etc) are null. E.g. if I request 
"http://myhost/example/index.html", both "uri" and "unparsed_uri"
contain "/example/index.html". I already checked your problem report db and
couldn't find any information explaining this behaviour.

State-Changed-Why:
The problem that you describe is s result of the way that
HTTP works combined with the way that the URI parsing code
works. The parsing code parses the URI that comes in on the
HTTP request line, and in the vast majority of cases this
doesn't include the scheme, host, or port. The URI parsing
code leaves NULL those parts of the URI that are not present,
typically scheme, host, & port, and frequently query. It is
up to more high-level parts of the server to decide what the
right value for the missing parts is -- see for example the
UseCanonicalName directive. Your module should use other
fields in the request_rec rather than the raw URI information
so that it can benefit from sanity checking and other logic
in the core that does the right thing with the parsed URI.
This should also improve the way that it interacts with other
modules, especially mod_rewrite.
