>Description:
I have made several attemps at compiling apache 1.3.3 and have not been able to 
get suEXEC to actually wrap cgi's. suexec is located in sbin, it is chmoded 
with the setuid bit, and httpd does recognize it's existance. However, when a 
cgi is executed, there is no evidence of the suexec doing its job, ie, the 
uid and gid is not changed.
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm not sure, as far as I can tell suexec no longer functions.
>Fix:
I wish :-)

Please give an example URL for a CGI you are trying to
execute.

You did read through the docs and are aware that it will only
be used for CGIs that are either in a ~user directory or
in a virtualhost with its own User and Group directives, right?

 Yes, the test that I am using involves first a shell and then a perl
 script in a user directory.

 That gives a 404 not found.
 
 Is Apache printing the suexec message in the error log?
 
 Why do you say the UID isn't being changed?

 No, it now gives a server error:
 
 500 - Misconfiguration
 
 
    Today's Date and Time: Thursday, 05-Nov-1998 12:19:18 EST
 
    There has been an error or misconfiguration was encountered while
    attempting to complete your request.
    The file /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs/12345/./test.cgi returned an
    error. Please contact webmaster@betelgeuse if you feel there is a
    mistake or if you'd like to report this incident.
 
 
 Is there really a ~12345 user in your passwd file with a home
 directory of /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs/12345/./ ?
 
 Are you sure the /./ isn't causing problems?
 
 What is your UserDir directive set to?
 
 > Since we run our server as root for certain business related reasons,
 
 There are no valid "business related reasons" to run your server as root.
 That is not a supported configuration and is not secure in any way.
