>Description:
I've looked and can't seem to find a solution to this so now I am 
submitting a change request.  I know its really close to the 1.2 release 
but if this made it in it would be really great.

I would like to have the ability to log proxy transactions to a seperate log
file.  Now if there is a way to do this already just let me know, but I've
looked over the code and documentation and don't see a way.

It would be nice to be able to say:
ProxyLog logs/proxy_log%0

State-Changed-Why:
This'll definitely have to be post-1.2 release. We're in
feature freeze for 1.2.0 release at this time. That means
bug fixes only, I'm afraid.

Comment-Added:
If the proxy is a separate vhost this is trivial to do, just
put a different TransferLog directive into the vhost.

State-Changed-Why:

As of the next release after 1.3.5, you can do this with
conditional logging.  Include a 'SetEnv proxy 1' directive
inside a '<Directory proxy:*>' container, and then use
the 'env=proxy' clause on your CustomLog directive.

Thanks for your patience, and for using Apache!
