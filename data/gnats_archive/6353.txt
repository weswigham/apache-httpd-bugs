>Description:
when i paste in the directive "indexignore" the wildcards "*.*" and "*" then nothing
will be listed when i delete or rename the "index.html" until resort the listing.

resorting by name needs two reloads and apache displays the files in the directory

resorting by size/ description/ description needs one reload and apache displays the files in
the directory

i think that's not the way the option is ment!!!
