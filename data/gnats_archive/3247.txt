>Environment:
OS : dgux R4.20MU02 generic AViiON PentiumPro (Data General Unix)
CC : gcc version 2.7.2 (ix86 DG/ux, DG-2.7.2.9, Feb  3 1998)
>Description:
There are two versions of DGUX.  There is the Intel version and the 
Motorola version.  The Intel version has support for strncasecmp, and 
strcasecmp in the string.h header file.  I am not to sure of the Motorola 
version.  The fix that I am suggesting will work on an Intel box.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have changed the DGUX section to the following following:

#elif defined(DGUX)
#define NO_KILLPG
#undef  NO_SETSID
#undef NEED_STRDUP
#ifdef _IX86_DG                /* Added to see if it is Intel */
#undef NEED_STRCASECMP
#undef NEED_STRNCASECMP
#else
#define NEED_STRCASECMP
#define NEED_STRNCASECMP
#endif                         /* End of fix */
#define bzero(a,b) memset(a,0,b)
/* A lot of SVR4 systems need this */
#define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
#define ap_inet_addr inet_network
#define HAVE_SYSLOG 1
