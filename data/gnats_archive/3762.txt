SunOS 5.6 Generic sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
"Redirect /directory/test http://web-server/directory/target"
in a .htaccess file in a directory with "Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch" set
does not work if there is a symbolic link  "test -> target"
in directory and the owner of the link "test" is different from the owner
of the "target" file. (Error: Symbolic link not allowed).

If the symbolic link is simply deleted, nothing else changed, then the
Redirect works fine.
Also if the symbolic link is owned by the same user as the target file,
then the Redirect works fine.

Bug or feature?
