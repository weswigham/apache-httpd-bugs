I've tried gcc 2.7.2.3 and egcs 1.02 for compilers with same result.
>Description:
My problem orginally started when I tried to use PHP and dl(/path/imap.so) and it
kept getting "relocation errors" with Apache 1.2.6 and PHP 3.0RC3.

So I'm trying again with Apache 1.3b7 and PHP3.0RC5.  I decided to try make PHP a
DSO module for Apache to see if that would work, and if it didn't, and I could fix
it, I could probably fix the PHP dl(/path/imap.so) problem.

./apachectl start
Syntax error on line 26 of /usr/local/apache/etc/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/libphp3.so into server: ld.so.1: /usr/loca
l/apache/sbin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /usr/local/apache/libexec/lib
php3.so: symbol ap_user_id: referenced symbol not found
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started
>How-To-Repeat:
Try it.
>Fix:
I'm not sure.  Help please.
