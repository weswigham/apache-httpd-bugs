>Description:
when a cgi program creates a page it fails to display the gif.
I have checked the gif can be displayed and when using netscape to view
it directly there is no problem, but the cgi generated page just shows
an image box. If the output from the cgi is saved to a file then the 
file is viewed with netscape, the image is displayed.
>How-To-Repeat:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{

	(void)printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");
	(void)printf("<html>\n");
	(void)printf("<head><title>Crossflight Ltd</title></head>\n");
	(void)printf("<body bgcolor=\"#ffffff\">\n");
	(void)printf("<center>");
	(void)printf("<h1>Crossflight Ltd</h1>");
	(void)printf("</center>");
	(void)printf("</body>\n");
	(void)printf("</html>\n");
         exit(0)
}

This is the code I am using (I think this is all the relevant bit). I suggest
try it with a gif of your choice. 
>Fix:
Um, only that I need to display a gif from a cgi program.
Also the same code runs fine on apache on linux, so I guess it is related to NT
somehow

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid I don't entirely understand.
The script you include doesn't have any link to any
GIF anywhere.  How are you thinking this CGI should
display a GIF?

Is there anything logged in the error log?  Does the access
log have an entry for the GIF?

If the GIF is bigger than 16k, does replacing it with
one smaller than 16k fix the problem?

 Because i was having to cut and paste it on ntg and I messed up.
 
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <stdlib.h>
 
 int main()
 {
 	(void)printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");
 	(void)printf("<html>\n");
 	(void)printf("<head><title>Crossflight Ltd</title></head>\n");
 	(void)printf("<body bgcolor=\"#ffffff\">\n");
 	(void)printf("<center>");
 	(void)printf("<h1>Crossflight Ltd</h1>");
 	(void)printf("<img src=\"xflt2.gif\" align=\"MIDDLE\""
 		"width=\"240\" height=\"150\">");
 	(void)printf("</center>");
 	(void)printf("<p>");
 	(void)printf("<center><h1>Proof of delivery query.</h1></center>\n");
 	(void)printf("<p>\n");
 	(void)printf("<center><table border=1 cellpadding=2>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td colspan=2><h2>Waybill number %s</h2></td><tr>\n",
 		getenv("QUERY_STRING"));
 	(void)printf("<tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>Client code</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>XXXXXXX</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("</tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>Consignee data</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>1XXXXXX<br>");
 	(void)printf("2XXXXXX<br>");
 	(void)printf("3XXXXXX<br>");
 	(void)printf("4XXXXXX<br>");
 	(void)printf("5XXXXXX</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("</tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>POD date</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>XXXXXXX</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("</tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>POD time</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>XXXXXXX</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("</tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>Recipient</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>XXXXXXX</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("</tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>Job cost</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("<td>XXXXXXX</td>\n");
 	(void)printf("</tr>\n");
 	(void)printf("</center></table>\n");
 	(void)printf("</body>\n");
 	(void)printf("</html>\n");
 
 	sleep(5);
 
 	return(TRUE);
 }
 
 Try that.  :)

 Nothing obvious in the error log, but yes it does appear in the access
 log.

 It is less than 11k.

 Paths are always relative to where the client thinks the directory is.
 CGI scripts aren't special.
 
 Please give an example of how exactly you are putting in this "complete
 url to another machine".  This really doesn't have anything to do with
 Apache, since Apache does nothing with the HTML you output and the client
 is the one that interprets relative filenames.

 Huh?  Don't put images in ScriptAliased directories.

 Apache does not change it to be relative.  Apache has nothing to do with
 it; it is between your CGI and your web client.  In the example you gave,
 you were giving a relative path.  That path is relative to the CGI script.

 I don't want to, but whenever I refer to a file in the cgi code it
 magically gains machine-name/cgi-bin before the path I give. Thus not
 finding the file i realy wanted. If I move the file to where it is looking
 it is then in a ScriptAliased directory and will be treated as a script,
 like I said not very useful for an image.

 Yes we realised that and tried giving a full path. See above
 
 
 Ok we found our problem(s) - 1. some of the code had \ between directories
 not / (we move it from the linux box, yup we do feel stupid)
 
 2. We have a corrupt gif on another machine
 
 3. We had missed the / in front of the file name on the one where we had
 checked the gif. (yup we feel even more stupid on that one)
 
 Thanks for your help
 
 problem fixed
