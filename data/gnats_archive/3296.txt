State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: randy
State-Changed-When: Wed Nov 11 12:59:01 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
It's been shown that this problem is caused when compiled
with gcc 2.8.1. Apache configuration defaults to gcc, so 
it is possible that the submitter was not completely succesful
in changing from the gcc compile. ??

>Unformatted:
Happens to mee too with two different compilers:
I tried

1) Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mips-sgi-irix6.2/2.8.1/specs
gcc version 2.8.1

2) irix's own cc

The system is 'IRIX www 6.2 03131015 IP22'

Any things I can test to solve it?
