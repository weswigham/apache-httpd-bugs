win95
>Description:
You might link to ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.3/simtelnet/win95/network/acntrl20.zip
as an alternative for win95 users running Apache in a console box.  Or maybe even
distribute it as a stop-gap measure until apache itself can run in the 
system tray.  The readme says it is freely distributable.
I would strongly suggest actually distributing it, but that's only me :-)
(from the readme) "a GUI controller for the Apache Web
Server running under Windows 95/98. It now runs in the system tray."
It works fairly well.
