State-Changed-Why:

I have no idea why this is being reported to the apache
bug database.  This is clearly a problem with the
configuration of your OS.  You don't even mention what
your OS is, but I'm gussing AIX.

Please report your problem to someone at IBM, since we
have absolutely no idea what is going on.

Thanks.
