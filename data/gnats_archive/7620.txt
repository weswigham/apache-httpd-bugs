 METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY=20

 Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we =
 will=20
 assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each=2E Let's=20=
 
 also assume that the mailing receive only a 0=2E2% response (the response=20=
 
 could be much better but lets just say it is only 0=2E2%=2E Also many peop=
 le=20
 will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each)=2E=
 =20
 Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails=2E With a 0=2E=
 2%=20
 response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1=2E Those 10 people respond=
 ed=20
 by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000=2E Out of those 50,=
 000=20
 e-mails only 0=2E2% responded with orders=2E That's=3D100 people responded=
  and=20
 ordered Report # 2=2E=20
 
 Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mail=
 s=2E=20
 The 0=2E2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3=2E=20
 Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-m=
 ails=20
 sent out=2E The 0=2E2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4=2E=
 =20
 Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000=20=
 
 (50 million) e-mails=2E The 0=2E2% response to that is 100,000 orders for =
 Report=20
 # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=3D$500,000=2E00 (half million)=2E=20=
 
 Your total income in this example is: 1=2E=2E=2E=2E=2E $50 + 2=2E=2E=2E=2E=
