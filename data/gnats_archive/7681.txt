Server version: Apache/1.3.19 (Unix)
OS  Red Hat 7.0 Linux kernel 2.2.17-14smp on a 2-processor i686
>Description:
We run Web Hosting servers with Apache. On one of our machines we see the following
behavior several times a week:
Apache stops accepting connections for several minutes, then recovers mysteriously. All other network
services (FTP, SSH) work perfectly all of the time. There are no entries in the Apache access or error logs
for the time in question. For example: 
www.xx1.de x.x.x.x - - [07/May/2001:00:01:30 +0200] "GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1" 404 291 "-"
www.xx2.de y.y.y.y - - [07/May/2001:00:01:31 +0200] "GET /Damenli.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 3448 "xxx.html"
www.xx2.de y.y.y.y - - [07/May/2001:00:01:39 +0200] "GET /bannera.jpg HTTP/1.0" 200 83832 "xxx.html"
www.xx3.de z.z.z.z - - [07/May/2001:00:08:15 +0200] "GET /bild.jpg?1248148008 HTTP/1.0" 200 8321 "http://www.zzzz.com/cam.php4?von=0"
Thus, no requests accepted for 7 minutes between 00:01:39 and 00:08:15. Our watchdog got timeouts during this period.
We made a system call trace during another occurrence of this bug (process id 19071 was the Apache parent, the other ids are children).

Please note that the strace for the children contains just one line (the fcntl) and nothing else, while the strace for the parent 19071 looks OK.

I should also note that this problem initially occurred on another hardware running Red Hat Linux 6.2 with kernel  2.2.16 and an earlier version of Apache. We have migrated the data
to the current configuration, but the problem survived.

Our guess is that this problem is perhaps related to the serialization problem discussed in the Apache Performance  Notes and http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0011.0/0596.html ,
so we experimented with the serialization flags. It seems that the problem occurs most often (almost daily) in the following situation:  USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT and listening on two ports. It occurs less often with USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT listening on one port or with USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT listening on two ports.

Any help is highly appreciated.
