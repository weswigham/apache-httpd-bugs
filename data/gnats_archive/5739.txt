>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
NT 4.0 SP 4, Apache 1.3.11 with EAPI, mod_jserv 1.1 (all recompiled except NT 8-))
>Description:
Sometimes, it seems that during the shutdown of Apache, the thread in charge 
of watching the JVM hangs. As it can't "read" any event state, the closing down
consists in it (the thread) being killed, and the JVM also, in the wrapper_destroy
function. I've tried to put a log instruction in the wrapper (by waiting
with a time-out and so on...), and it effectively stops tracing as soon
as the shutdown begins.
Sometimes, the thread is well running, but fails in sending the SHUTDOWN
function to the JVM (AJPV12 error). The java side also traces an exception
(Unterminated Stream or something like that).
>How-To-Repeat:
Send me a log of a clean shutdown on NT and I'll begin to think that my 
platform is in fault...
>Fix:
After 3 days spent on the problem, I must admit I'm out of ideas. Maybe a weird
mutual exclusion problem.
