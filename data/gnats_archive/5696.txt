>Description:
I want to print a literal percent (%) sign in the log file.
You should be able to do this with an escape (\%)

I tried these in the httpd.conf file:
LogFormat "%u\%%h" percenttest
LogFormat "%u\\%%h" percenttest
LogFormat "%u%%%h" percenttest

none worked.
>How-To-Repeat:
repeat the config given above.
>Fix:
Add one more case to parse_misc_log_string (in http_log.c),
if you see a % immediately after a \, then just copy % to the output.
