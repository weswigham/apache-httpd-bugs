Windows NT 4.0
>Description:
I have set up an Apache web server (1.3.6) from binaries that I downloaded from 
the apache site. Eveything seems to work fine, including running .bat CGI 
scripts. The problem is that I cant get even the simplest perl scripts to run 
through CGI. 
I have see a related bug report which says use the full path 
#!c:\perl\bin\perl.exe instead of the simple #! perl, but nothing seems to fix it.


>How-To-Repeat:
Example perl code I tried:

#!c:\perl\bin\perl.exe
print "content-type: text/plain\n";
>Fix:
Nope! Seems like I am missing something very fundamental, cause I am sure Apache on NT 
should definitly run perl CGI scripts! Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
Apache on NT runs perl scripts just fine. Where is your 
perl interpreter installed? Does the #! line in your script
point to the interpreter? Use forward slashes rather than
backslashes on the #! line. See any error messages in the
error log?
