>Description:
I am experiencing a very strange problem upon the successful completion of
a cgi script that lists various search results and a displays a new form
to continue searching.  

Basically everything works perfectly without any errors expect that in
Netscape 3.0.1, a window is displayed upon successful completion of the cgi
script, requesting whether the user would like to Repost Form Data ?

This behavior occurs on Win NT and 95 and only on Netscape 3.  This error
does not occur on Netscape 4, Netscape on Mac, or on Internet Explorer version
3 or above on any system.

If the user clicks "Ok" a duplicate "POST" request is made to the cgi script
which finishes successfully again without the Repost Form Data ? prompt. This
behavior continues to alternate between receiving the prompt and not
receiving the prompt despite the fact that the output is always correct
and complete.

I suspect this is a HTTP protocol or cache negotiation problem but I have not
been able to change the behavior successfully.  Forcing HTTP 1.0 responses
don't seem to help.

This is probably an issue related to you sending certain
headers.  Please provide an example URL so I can comment
further.

It is unlikely to be a problem with Apache.

 Mark,
 
 Thank you for your time in investigating this.  We have determined that
 a cgi-generated META tag specifying content-type was the cause of this
 strange behavior. I guess that particular version of Netscape was thinking
 it was  some type of multipart mime message.
 
 Thanks Again.
