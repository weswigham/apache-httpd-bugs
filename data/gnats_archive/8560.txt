Win32 - Binary release
Apache 1.3.22
>Description:
MultiViews does not work when I point my URL to:

    http://mySever/mySampleFileName.html

for these 2 files:
    1. mySampleFileName.html.en
    2. mySampleFileName.html.ja.jis

However, when renamed to:
    1. mysamplefilename.html.en
    2. mysamplefilename.html.ja.jis

everything works as advertised.

>How-To-Repeat:
Yes
>Fix:
use all lowercase letters in filenames for files requiring MultiViews
