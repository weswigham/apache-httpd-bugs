State-Changed-Why:
First off, we don't support 1.2 betas any more since 1.2.0 is
out.

It is normal to get such messages when clients disconnect
in the middle of a transfer.

Do you have some reason to think it is a problem?  You
sure it isn't just due to different traffic patterns?
It is possible this is caused by broken clients when
trying to read PDF files; did anyone add any to your site
recently?
