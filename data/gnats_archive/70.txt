>Description:
suexec fails if the script directory is NFS-mounted without root access
and is only readable and executable for owner. This is because suexec
is checking the permissions and existence of the script as root which
is mapped to user unknown (i.e. uid nobody) on NFS mounted filesystems
which are not exported/shared with option root=.
>How-To-Repeat:
server$ chmod 700 /export/home/user/public_html/cgi-bin
server$ exportfs -i -o rw=client /export/home/user  # or share -F nfs -o ...
client$ mount -F nfs server:/export/home/user /home/user
srm.conf: ScriptAlias /~user/cgi-bin/ /home/user/public_html/cgi-bin
>Fix:
setuid() in suexec.c should be called before doing the permission tests
because root can't do them, only the owner of the script directory.
