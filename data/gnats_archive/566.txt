>Description:
If you want to use the mod_status module, you must run Apache
as standalone using the ServerType directive in httpd.conf.
You will get an empty page(ie. This page contains no data) if
you run Apache with ServerType inetd.
>How-To-Repeat:
Get mod_status working correctly with ServerType standalone,
then switch to inetd.
>Fix:
I imagine the status information is generated periodically by
the server. Since inetd mode only runs a server process when
a request comes in, the status information is never created.
My suggestion is that the documentation be changed to indicate
mod_status only works in standalone mode

State-Changed-Why:
Documentation updated to add a note about it only working
in standalone mode.  We will consider if special case code
should be added to make the server return an error if it
is attempted, instead of core dumping like it does currently.

State-Changed-Why:
Code was committed to make it stop core dumping in this case.
But the status page has no meaning when running as ServerType inetd.
