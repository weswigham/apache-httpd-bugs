>Description:
The problem was first described as a support request in PR#858.
Maybe there are some relations with PR#614 too.

The problem occurs when you have three conditions:

1. Proxy translation.
AND
2. Submit button in form page.
AND
3. IP URLs answers in the "real" server.

  When you get a page throught the proxy, use a submit button in this page
and this button returns a IP URL (like http://10.0.0.1/page2.html), the
proxy don´t translate the IP address to the Proxy Server Name.
  It works like a redirection. If the IP is a dummy, the client is unable
to get the page pointed by the cgi in submit button.
  The URLs in PR#858 shows the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Put a server (www1) with a form page with a submit button.
   The submit button has a IP URL as answer (ex. http://10.0.0.1/page2.html)
   www1 - 10.0.0.1
   index.html and page2.html
2. Put an Apache 1.2 (www2) with proxy module and a proxyPass directive:
   www2 - 10.0.0.2
   ProxyPass /teste http://www1
3. Get one page in www1 throught the proxy www2
   http://www2/teste/index.html
4. Use the submit button.
   The proxy will make a redirect (not a proxy) to www1.
   It will return 10.0.0.1/... when the right was www2/...

The problem occurs just when www1 returns an IP number in the URL.
>Fix:
I tested two ways:

1. Make all redirected pages with named URLs (mainly the cgi ones).
2. Use Apache 1.1.3 - The problem don´t occurs here

State-Changed-Why:

mod_proxy is not designed to translate an IP address into
a name.

What URL do you use as ACTION in your FORM?

I'm a bit puzzled about what do you want to achieve
but are you sure about the ProxyPass arguments?
Maybe you need to specify something like
ProxyPass http://www1/teste ...

Comment-Added:

After additional user input the problem appears to be
a bug in mod_proxy (?).

A directive like

  ProxyPass /path/foobar  http://somewhere/anything

does not work, when '/path/' is a path that exists
on the local (proxy) server (eg. an existing directory).
The local server tries to handle the requests locally
and ignores the ProxyPass directive.

If '/path/' does not exist on the server, the request
is correctly forwarded as specified in the ProxyPass
directive.

Possible workarounds:

  - use only path arguments with ProxyPass that are not
    existing on the local server
  - use mod_rewrite
