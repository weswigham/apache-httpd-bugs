>Description:
In recent editions of the httpd.conf files, these lines appear in order 
to protect .htaccess files from being viewed.

<Files .htaccess>
    Order allow,deny 
    Deny from all
</Files>

Typically a .htaccess file is created with the path to a "users" and/or "groups"
files.  Since WebMasters are lazy, they tend to leave these files in the same
directory as the .htaccess file, such that a malcontent could possibly guess
this file name and harvest it.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
As a preventative measure, I recommend that following be added to the default
Apache httpd.conf in order to protect ALL hidden files (under a Unix system).
All a webmaster has to then to protect special data files is rename them as a
dot file, for example :  "users" and "groups" files as ".users" and ".groups".  This also has the added benefit that
a webmaster using a dot file probably doesn't want the public looking at them.

# Dot files should stay hidden.
<FilesMatch "^\.">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all 
</FilesMatch>

State-Changed-Why:
I set it to protect .ht* ... rather than all dot files.
