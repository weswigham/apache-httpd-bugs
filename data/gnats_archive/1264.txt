>Description:
After upgrading from 1.2.4 to 1.3b2, most of my cgi in cgi-bin and cgi-bin
 subdirectory have stopped working using suexec.  I have had suexec
 installed with every version of apache since suexec has been made
 available and all my scripts have always worked.  If I downgrade to version
 1.2.4 all my scripts work fine, if I upgrade to 1.3b2 most stop working.

The following is a sample error displayed by my browser. 

[404 Not Found]
The requested URL /cgi-bin/URIBS/Current-Users-Wrapper was not found on this server.

my access_log shows the following
hercules.ls.barrhead.ab.ca - - [19/Oct/1997:21:28:30 -0600] "GET /cgi-bin/URIBS/
Current-Users-Wrapper?table=1 HTTP/1.0" 404 178 "http://www.lands.ab.ca/" "Mozil
la/3.01Gold (Win95; I)"   

The following is the error message from the error_log
[Sun Oct 19 21:28:30 1997] [error] script not found or unable to stat 
>How-To-Repeat:
I can reproce the problem anytime just by re-installing 1.3b2.
>Fix:
Whish I could help you but I can't.  I will however do any testing or
configuration changes that you would like to assist in fixing this bug

State-Changed-Why:

Does Apache issue the extra suexec message when you start it?
If not you need to recompile Apache and tell him where
he can find the suexec binary.
