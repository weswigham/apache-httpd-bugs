Hi,

I am a kid, and I am a programmer! I have been recently doing some work on Apache source for a new company which is going to start soon, to allow the parsing of CGI/SSI files to put banner in the top or put banner in place of <!--banner--> which is sent as an output of either CGI or SSI, and I have succesfully done it, by redirecting all the output of the CGI to a CGI outside the document root, which parses the data, and then it reads the data back (using Apache API ab_spawn), it works like a charm for both CGI and SSI. This can be VERY useful for many people! Hypermart and VirtualAve does something like that but they don't send the data to a script for parsing, but they just print out the direct header from the main handler function.

I am pretty sure that it is not yet supported by Apache, as I aksed earlier before starting work on it and you guyz replied in negative.

Now I would like to take up the credit and honour to send it to you to distribute it publicly, perhaps as mod_xcgi and mod_xinclude in contributed directory.

do you give credits to the creator? :)

BTW, I am 15 year old, and remember, AGE DOES NOT MATTER! :)

Thank you.

PS. I am wondering that why do you guyz work on Apache? You give it for free, what do you get? Is there a proper team or just a bunch of people who submits info and a maintainer (or group of 2-3 people) release new Apache CURRENT++ version?

Looking forward to hear from you.
