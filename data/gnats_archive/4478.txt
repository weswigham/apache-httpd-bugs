>Description:

I upgrade from 1.3.3 to 1.3.6. 
My access.conf has a password lock  on a directory that worked for 1.3.3, I got a
logon dialog... I upgraded to the latest version 1.3.6, and now it does not allow me
to login... I got the following errors in my error log

"crypt() unavailable on Win32". I have a clear text psswd file, so I am not sure
why it seems to be tryign to run crypt...
PS: I also downloaded the jserv serverlet engine...
