State-Changed-Why:
First, please try 1.3.3.  We ask you to use the latest version
for a reason: bugs are always being fixed.

Second, did you get any other errors or warnings while trying to compile?
If you extract a fresh copy of Apache and try from scratch,
does it still fail?

 As my reported stated, I started with 1.3.3, which failed; 1.3.2 built
 successfully.
