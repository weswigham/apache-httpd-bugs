 the latest version 1.3.9 dont have shutdown apache as consule either in the start menu so i always end up with unclean shutdown not like in 1.3.6 version and i am not good with dos so it would help if there is a short cut in the start menu to shut down i t and is there any way to make it run from backround 
 thanks ...
