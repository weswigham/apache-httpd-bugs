JDK 1.1.4
JSDK 2.0
JSERV 1.0b1
>Description:
I have protected the root directory with a .htaccess file. I have declared a servlet zone in a subdirectory of the root directory.
I use the servlet from a very simple HTML form :
<FORM ACTION=/soceca/SocecaServlet>
<INPUT TYPE=.....>
</FORM>

When I asked my html page, the security prompt works correctly and when I submit the form, the servlet is correctly launched except that the "getRemoteUser" is unable to get back the remote user from the security prompt.
How can I get it ???

 I have nothing in my mail box and nothing in the bugs database. Is it a
 hard problem ??
 
 Have a good week-end,
