>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Server ServicePack1 and 2, Apache 1.3.19, mod_ssl-2.8.3-1.3.19, openssl-0.9.6a, ApacheJServ-1.1.2, mod_perl-1.25 and JDK 1.3, JSDK 2.0 and MSVC 6.0
>Description:
The child process of apache exists in recvwithtimeout in buff.c. The assertion
fails and it calls exit.

[Mon May 21 09:23:22 2001] file .\main\buff.c, line 220, assertion "!rv" failed

.../main/buff.c:

    rv = ioctlsocket(sock, FIONBIO, (u_long*)&iostate);
    iostate = 0;
    ap_assert(!rv);     <<  This assertion fails.

The same happens with Apache 1.3.12 and ApacheJServ 1.1.1.

With the child process of apache the JVM exits, too. After apache starts
a new child, it cannot the JVM, because the socket of 8007 is already in
use. The only solution is to stop and start apache.

Have anyone some experiences with Apache and ApacheJServ on Windows 2000
(W2K)?
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Install apache and jserv on Windows 2000.
2. Run more than 20 clients in parallel and each client sends a requests to the IsItWorking servlet.
3. After 10-15 minutes the child process of apache exit.
