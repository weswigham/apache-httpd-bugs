>Description:
My problem is a little bit complex :
I wanna setup apache to be a proxy before another proxies that request an
 authentification and to run a cgi for each query for statistics purposes.
I defined "www.crm.mot.com" to be the proxy of my Netscape client, added a
rewrite rule :
 
RewriteRule  ^proxy:(.*) http://www.crm.mot.com/cgi-bin/proxy.cgi?$1 [P]

My problem is that my CGI does not receive the Proxy-authorization from the 
client even if I enabled the -DSECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION at compile time.

What is strange is that it works for direct queries but not for queries using
the server as a proxy... Peharps the [P] (force proxy flag) does not forward
all the headers to the proxy module ? But as, as far as I understand, this
header is parsed into env variables (main/util_script.c:ap_add_common_vars()),
it should be ?

Actually, if I manually query the server for the local cgi and passing the proxy 
authentification, the script get it :
GET /cgi-bin/proxy.cgi HTTP/1.0  
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive  
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.05 [en] (X11; I; Linux 2.0.32 i586)  
Host: www.courbis.com  
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*  
Accept-Language: en   
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1,*,utf-8  
Proxy-authorization: Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

=> proxy.cgi receives the authentification HTTP_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION

If I ask for :
GET http://www.courbis.com/ HTTP/1.0  
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive  
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.05 [en] (X11; I; Linux 2.0.32 i586)  
Host: www.courbis.com  
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*  
Accept-Language: en   
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1,*,utf-8  
Proxy-authorization: Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

then proxy.cgi doesn't receive it !

(I thought I'd find it in HTTP_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION or REDIRECTED_HTTP_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION)

Could you help please ?
>How-To-Repeat:
I can send you the CGI code, despite a simple shell script :
#!/bin/sh
echo Content-type: text/plain
echo
env | sort

can show you the problem. The easied way to reproduce it is to  use a version
of apache compiled with proxy/module & -DSECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION. Then
to setup the abose RewriteRule and to telnet the above queries to the
server...

Ok a little follow up :
-----------------------

I solved the problem by using the following directive :
RewriteRule  ^proxy:(http:.*) /cgi-bin/proxy.cgi?$1 [PT]

But, it showed me another problem. We have the followin config


Network===apache proxy======>proxy WITH authentification====internet
                \\
                  ==========>proxy WITHOUT authentification===other intranet

When we try to go out to the internet, the client receives an authentification
request. But when it answers, the Proxy-authorization field is blocked by
the apache proxy (modules/proxy/proxy_http.c). There should be a flag in
the ProxyRemote directive telling if a remote proxy should get the
authorization field or not... As a temporary patch, I removed some
code from modules/proxy/proxy_http.c, but ANY remote server receives the
authorization field which is NOT secure at all !
