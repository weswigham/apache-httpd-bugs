uname -a:
Linux bratwustle 2.2.5 #2 Sat Apr 10 22:59:27 CEST 1999 i686 unknown
gcc: version 2.8.1
Major external module: PHP4.0.1pl2 included in Apache (staticly compiled in)
>Description:
Using the following config:
 <Directory /WWW/intranet>
  AuthUserFile /some/file
  AuthName Intranet
  AuthType Basic
  order deny,allow
  require valid-user
  ErrorDocument 401 /fel/error401.php3
 </Directory>

It never asks for username/password, but instead allways returns the output from
the ErrorDocument. No errors are found in the logfiles.

The error occured when I upgraded the Apache binary from 1.3.7 (with php 3.0.7)
to Apache 1.3.12 (with php 4.0.1pl2). The exact same config files are being
used, with the only exception that the AddType changed for the new version of
PHP.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unknown, since I only switched the apache binary and upgraded the php module
compiled with it.
>Fix:
Work around is to comment out the ErrorDocument directive, but then I don't get
the explenation I want to show the users if he/she enters incorrect username/
password and then choose cancel.

 Solution:
 Error wasn't in Apache it was in PHP4.
 Upgrade from 4.0.1pl2 to 4.0.2 solved the problem.
 
 Thanks for the terrific job you are doing. :)
