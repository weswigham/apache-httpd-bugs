>Description:
I can't use a virtualhost on Apache with Win98.
I know that the problem is with the IP. The main server got the IP of my network card (It works as I can see the doc directory) but for the other subdomains I can't do anything.
Can anybody show me a program which make win98 able to have multiple IP.

>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to use multi subdomains.

I'm waiting your answer on my e-mail.
