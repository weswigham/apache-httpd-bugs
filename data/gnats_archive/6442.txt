Windows - 98
>Description:
I m using Apache/1.3.6 on Windows 98. also installed ApacheJServ/1.0 on the same system. my pc has IP Address 80.0.5.53. and when i start Apache on it with URL http://127.0.0.1:80/jserv/ it gives following error:

Forbidden 

You do not have permission to access /jserv/ on this server.

So, what is wrong with this installation. Is there any error? No doubt i installed successfully Apache Server on the same system but could not install the Jserv properly.
