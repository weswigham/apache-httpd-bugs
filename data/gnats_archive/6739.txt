Solaris 2.7 and wget with a default configure/compile.
>Description:
Unable to download (forbidden) the latest stable version of the server 1.3.14 from 

Name:    httpd.apache.org
Address:  63.211.145.10

using wget.

It would be a good idea to note the problem some place on 
the page or find a better way to deal with abuse if this 
is abuse related rather than blocking legitimate traffic.
Someone seems to have made some assumptions or be mistaken
as to the nature of what should be able to download from 
the website. 
>How-To-Repeat:

wget http://httpd.apache.org/dist/apache_1.3.14.tar.gz
--17:28:02--  http://httpd.apache.org:80/dist/apache_1.3.14.tar.gz
           => `apache_1.3.14.tar.gz'
Connecting to httpd.apache.org:80... connected!
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 403 Forbidden
17:28:03 ERROR 403: Forbidden.

>Fix:
wget --user-agent=ANNOYED http://httpd.apache.org/dist/apache_1.3.14.tar.gz

State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 25 06:42:55 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
This is a deliberate configuration on the apache.org web
server because we have had trouble in the past with badly
written robots causing excessive load. Sorry if this causes
trouble for you.
