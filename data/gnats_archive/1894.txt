doesn't matter
>Description:
SUEXEC_BIN is set to a file in /usr/local/apache regardless of
the configured setting of HTTPD_ROOT.  If someone has ExecCGI
turned on under UserDirs, upgrades with HTTPD_ROOT = something
else, and runs it, the CGI scripts will be run as the server.

Naturally, you should check things like this before you upgrade,
but some folks won't.

That makes sense; not just for the suexec define, but
also for DOCUMENT_LOCATION.  Done, thanks.
