>Description:
It would be nice if the customisation option existed for Apache to notify
clients (using the Cache-Control directive of HTTP/1.1) when it is serving
them restricted content. 

Many sites use IP / Domain based restrictions on their content, only to be
thwarted by local cache or indexing systems throwing this content "over the
wall", due to a lack of awareness of the restrictions. Squid, and other
caching products, honour Cache-Control directives as a means of restriction,
and it would be nice if the _optional_ functionality existed to enable Apache
sending these.

I've attached a patch which enables this behaviour by default - obviously this
would need to be configurable before it made its way into release code, but
I'm seeking a "yes this is a good idea" or "no, don't be silly" before doing
that.

A patch which contains the functionality, but not the configuration option:
