Solaris 2.5, APACHE v1.1.1, not really related to this
>Description:
If you start apache twice the pid file is overwritten even though
the 2nd invocation fails and the 1st is uneffected. So if later
you want to shutdown the original invocation you have to do it
by hand 
>How-To-Repeat:
Just start apache as per normal, then start it again
>Fix:
Yep, move the call to log_pid() after the attempt to bind() to the socket
so that when the bind() call fails log_pid() is not called.
