>Environment:
I have never used apache on linux, but I tested Apache 1.3.12 Win32 on Windows 98. And there was no User Interface is was just a console. I see that Apache is a very powerful HTTP server. But it is a little bit tricky to configure it, good is that the .conf files are good documented with comments. Earlier before I've runned apache I tried a Windows web server called Xitami, it can be found at http://www.imatix.com/, I DONT think it is as powerful as Apache, but it is very easy to configure and it can be configured from anywhere via a web option dialog that the admin logs into.
>Description:
I know this is a bug reporting form, but I have to post this ;)
it would be great woth a feature suggestion form to!
>How-To-Repeat:
Test the Webserver Xitami at http://www.imatix.com/ and see it and get inspired.
Make a nicer 32bit interface (but keep the console interface to but seperate), and make it able to be minimized to the system tray. Make all or the most settings configureable via a option díalog in the app, and maybe some basic settings configureable via a web page.
>Fix:
Start coding ;)
Drink coffée and coca-cola, stay up all night...

Hope to see some easy and nice features ;)

State-Changed-Why:

Thank you for your suggestions and interest in the Apache
server project.

Apache, that is the core server, contains no UI for config.
That is beyond the scope of the core project.  There are,
however, a number of configuration interfaces for Apache
in the open source community, and you can find information
about these projects at http://gui.apache.org/
