>Description:
The deprecated Referer_log module allows you to filter what goes into
the logfile. This way you can keep referers from within your own site out
of the logs - more than 95% of the time. This makes a refererlog more
useful by not filling up your harddisk completely.

Bad enough, the new CustomLog module, while having more features in
general, does not allow this filtering.

I hope you will add such a feature in the future.

State-Changed-Why:
This sort of functionality has been discussed before
and no real conclusions drawn as yet.  I am marking this
report as "suspended" so it won't be forgotten when
enhancement discussions resume.  Right now 1.3 is in
feature-freeze, so it almost certainly *won't* be in
that version.  It definitely won't be in 1.2 at all.
Thanks for the report, and for using Apache!

 It's largely unrequired with 1.3 because as of 1.3 you can pipe your logs
 through an external program in a reliable.  The external program can do
 whatever complicated filtering you're interested in.

 Request for #PR1351 done in #PR3449... (same request).
 Feature has been implemented for some sort of backward compatability
 (not 100% compat.) to get rid of mod_log_referer.

 Aggreed, but on a heavy loaded Server (like our main server, doing also
 intranet web stuff) you get a performance penalty if you are using
 external logfilters.
 
 So: IMO it's ok, if a webserver has a basic(!) means of filtering
 features
 to minimize logsize (saves > 90% of unwanted referer log entries on an
 intranet site!)

This has been added as conditional logging, and will be

your patience, and for using Apache!
