This problem arises in the build process using ./configure.  If this issue
should be posted elsewhere, please let me know where.

I am trying to build apache with php3 as a DSO that has postgreSQL support.

Working in the php3 source directory, I used the php3 configure script
with arguments to support pgsql.  The configure, make and make install
proceeded without errors.

Working in the apache source directory, I ran apache configure as follows:

./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/apache \
--enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max \
--activate_module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a \
--enable-shared=php3 \
--enable-module=so

Then I ran make.  It reported errors as follows:

gcc -rpath /usr/local/pgsql/lib -shared -o mod_vhost_alias.so mod_vhost_alias.lo 
gcc: unrecognized option `-rpath'
/usr/local/pgsql/lib: file not recognized: Is a directory
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[4]: *** [mod_vhost_alias.so] Error 1
make[3]: *** [all] Error 1
make[2]: *** [subdirs] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/apache_1.3.9/src'
make[1]: *** [build-std] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/apache_1.3.9'
make: *** [build] Error 2                                                       

Evidently the generated Makefile included an option that gcc does not
understand.

Help will be much appreciated.

>How-To-Repeat:
The preparatory steps to build php3 as a DSO (per php3 INSTALL.DSO)
are as follows:

./configure \
--with-shared-apache=/usr/src/apache_1.3.9/ \
--with-config-file-path=/usr/src/apache_1.3.9/conf/httpd.conf \
--with-pgsql=/usr/local/pgsql 

make
make install
