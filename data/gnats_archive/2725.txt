>Environment:
SCO 3.2v4.2 with SCO compiler
>Description:
The timeval struct is defined in two SCO .h files (same definition).
sys/time.h and sys/select.h

One of the apache files includes both these .h files, and so compilation fails with an error that timeval is being redifined.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile on same platform
>Fix:
edit /usr/include/sys/time.h and /usr/include/sys/select.h to have the timeval declaration change FROM

struct timeval {
        long            tv_sec; /* seconds */
        long            tv_usec;/* and microseconds */
};        

TO

#ifndef DIDTIMEVAL
#define DIDTIMEVAL
struct timeval {
        long            tv_sec; /* seconds */
        long            tv_usec;/* and microseconds */
};
#endif          

(in BOTH .h files)

Then it will compile OK.

Since this is a SCO problem, there's not much we can
do about it.  Please report it to SCO if you haven't
already.  Thanks for using Apache!
