State-Changed-Why:
I don't see what the problem is -- regexps are documented to
the extent that they are used. mod_include.html says:
      Compare string1 with string 2. If string2 has the form /string/ then it is compared as a regular
      expression. Regular expressions have the same syntax as those found in the Unix egrep command.

 But it doesn't says that it uses egrep compliant expressions.
 Then there is a software bug which I'll report independantly, because "^" 
 does not work.

Comment-Added:
I don't really understand what you are saying. The documentation
quite clearly states that the regexp uses egrep syntax.
As far as I can tell, ^ works as intended; there is however
a syntax error in the custom_errordocs.html page.

 Use single quotes, not double quotes.

 It is documented in the mod_include documentation; you were copying
 some incorrect examples from custom_errordocs.html which I have fixed.
