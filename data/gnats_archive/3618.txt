>Description:
I am trying to authenticate users in ~user directory and subdirectories.
.htaccess works with htdocs sub-directories fine.

Unfortunately, have full access to files in ~user directory with
.htaccess present. It appears to be ignored by webserver.

When parent directory /home is set to "allowoverride authtype" in access.conf,
(I copied htdocs configuration which works and changed the directory path)
I get permission denied to access ~user even though ALL permissions in ~user 
and /home are set are to 755. Can access file directly through web browser by 
openning files.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Is this a problem with restricting access to the root directory /? 
Apache can't see /home even though it's configured in access.conf:

<Directory />
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

<Directory "/home">
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride AuthConfig
order allow,deny
allow from all
deny from none
</Directory>

Well, what does the error log say?

What does "echo ~user" from a shell say?  ie. are you sure
it is actually /home being used, and not just something that
is a symlink to /home or /home is a symlink to.  You have
to modify your settings for the directory listed in the passwd
file.

All that "deny from none" does is deny accesses from a host
called "none".

This is almost certainly a configuration error and is very
unlikely to be anything resembling a bug in Apache.

 Everything normal - no errors reported

 "echo ~user" reports /home/~user

 I tried ~user/path/passwdfile and it was ignored.

 Thanks - removed..

 I rechecked all permissions and found that I had .htaccess set to 711,
 changed to 755. I then noticed that I had an extra file called
 "access.conf%". It had the configuration that I used to check /home
 directory configuration (typo in file name?). I reconfigured access.conf
 for /home and everything worked fine.
 
 Yes it was a configuration error - PEBKAC (problem exists between keyboard
 and chair). Thanks for responding and making me double check everything
 again. :-)
