>Environment:
WinNT BackOffice, 64Mb, 6Gb, 333Mhz. Apache 1.3.1. Perl from ActiveState
>Description:
After a day or two the amount of perl proccess are about 50 and Apache hangs, so perl after executing do not close. After closing Apache all perl proccesses are closing too(so this is because of Apache, not perl). Proccesse are accumulated not after start of Apache, but after about half a day. I've tried to change Perl, Apache, re-install OS.

Something with perl proccesses

State-Changed-Why:
I am closing this PR as a dup of PR 3168, even though I 
don't think this an Apache problem directly. Someting is
wrong with one (or more) of your perl scripts (or the
interpreter) which is preventing the proccess from exiting gracefully. This will eventually cause all your 
Apache threads to be blocked waiting on these errant perl
processes to complete.

With the fix I have in mind, Apache will kill off 
misbehaving CGI processes.
