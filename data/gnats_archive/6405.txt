 Hello
 
 I am learning java and when try to bridge between weblogic and apache it's 
 giving a problem like this .
 
 The basic porblem is while uploading a file ,i am using a servlet to do 
 uploading .when i work in weblogic alone it takes upto 1mb as per my 
 functionality and when there is bridge between weblogic and apache it 
 does'nt take more than 200kb .
 
 I am handling in my servlet saying my max file size is 1MB only ,i dont know 
 why is not taking up when there is bridge betwen weblogic and apache bridge 
 .
 
 Do i need to change some properties anywhere ,if so where i need to change 
 it .
 The error it gives is (java.io.InterruptedIOException: Read timed out        
    )
 
 
 can u look inot and get back to me
 
 Thanks
 lnr
