Linux RHL 2.2.9 with IPv6 enabled
>Description:
Unlike on IPv4, on IPv6 non-IPv6-less virtual hosting won't work.

Try given config, server "3ffe:400:100:f101::a1" will not response. The first one wins.

>How-To-Repeat:

State-Changed-Why:
Updating to 2.0.28.  Submitter's comments below:

Same like before, but now I got a warning on startup:

[Sun Nov 18 02:32:53 2001] [warn] _default_ VirtualHost overlap on
port 80, the first has precedence

But don't know why!

lsof shows following:

httpd2    16622 root    3u  IPv4  59140       TCP 192.168.1.17:www
(LISTEN)
httpd2    16622 root    4u  IPv4  59141       TCP 192.168.1.18:www
(LISTEN)
httpd2    16622 root    5u  IPv6  59142       TCP
[3ffe:400:100:f101::a0]:www (LISTEN)
httpd2    16622 root    6u  IPv6  59143       TCP
[3ffe:400:100:f101::a1]:www (LISTEN)

No additional servers are configured.

BTW: Warning goes away, if I've disabled the second IPv6 virtual host
like

<VirtualHost [3ffe:400:100:f101::a0]:80>
    DocumentRoot /home/internet/testserver1/pub
</VirtualHost>

#<VirtualHost [3ffe:400:100:f101::a1]:80>
#    DocumentRoot /home/internet/testserver2/pub
#</VirtualHost>

Looks like there is still an IPv6 config handling bug.

Is there anyone on apache2 side which has tested the given scenario? 

 Peter

State-Changed-Why:
Here's the patch which was just committed (all one line):

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/server/vhost.c.diff?r1=1.62&r2=1.63

This gets rid of the warning message about _default_ vhost
overlap and gets my IPv6 vhosts working right again.  I
tested a config with two IPv6 vhosts and a config with
two IPv4 vhosts, but not a config with both IPv4 and IPv6
vhosts.  If this doesn't resolve your problem, please open
another PR.

Thanks for your patience, and thanks for using Apache 2.0!

It looks like Mr. Rowe meant to re-open some other PR.

This PR was fixed in CVS after 2.0.28 and closed at that 
time.
