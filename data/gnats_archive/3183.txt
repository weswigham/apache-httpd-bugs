Win95, Apache in a Dos-box.
>Description:
When you start the apache 1.3.3 for win32 in a dox box in win9x and you
close apache with ctrl-d . At the next start of apache he told me that
the httpd.pid was overwritten and the server wasn't clearly shut down.

The setting in httpd.conf doesn't also work
# PidFile: The file the server should log its pid to
# PidFile logs/httpd.pid
>How-To-Repeat:
start and stop server and once again in win9x
>Fix:
None
