 How often does this happen?
 
 Do you have HostnameLookups enabled?  If so, are you sure this isn't just
 that the reverse DNS for the address in question is bogusly configured to
 return a hostname of "194"?
 
 Are they always the same address or do they differ?

 Marc,
 
 I have HostnameLookups off. This behavior appears with accesses from
 many hosts. From the same browsing session, some are complete (e.g.
 194.123.123.123) and some are truncted (e.g. 194). Today, 3800 out of
 25000 were truncated. I'm running apache 1.3b6 with PHP3RC4,
 mod_auth_mysql, mod_log_mysql and other standard modules.
 
 Thanks for Apache,
 Len

State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 10 01:03:32 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Please visit http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/2366, there
is a patch in that page which should fix this problem.

Or you can pick up a snapshot of 1.3.1-dev at
ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs/, it includes the
bugfix.  If you don't want to use the entire snapshot,
you can just use the src/modules/standard/mod_usertrack.c
file which has the bugfix.

I'm gonna close this 'cause that should solve the problem...
if it doesn't we'll reopen.
