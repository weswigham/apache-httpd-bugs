State-Changed-Why:
Are you using any virtualhosts?  If so, how many?

This really looks like a problem with your OS.  There is nothing
Apache can do that should require your OS to be rebooted.

Also, as always, please try the current version of Apache.

Comment-Added:
Try raising the value in /proc/sys/kernel/file-max.

There's more docs in the Documentation tree of the
kernel source code.
