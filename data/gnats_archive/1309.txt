>Description:
`date` used in buildmark.c building in general httpd Makefile which
indirectly assume pure ascii environment. Next place with the same bug
is support/log_server_status script. C locale forcing should be used
otherwise national characters pass in depending to current locale.
>How-To-Repeat:

`date` should be changed to `LC_TIME=C date` in both Makefile and

Please supply a patch to fix this if you want.  And search the
bug database for all the other locale issues, there are many.

Oh and then go test it on the dozens of platforms we support and
maybe you'll understand why it hasn't been dealt with yet.

 This may well be changed to just being a file that uses __DATE__
 and __TIME__ to avoid issues with NT and other OSes that don't support
 complex and advanced things like this.

 Anyone know if this works in NT at all?  Well, if the original version
 or this one works at all.

 This fix is safe, it fix problem or does nothing on platforms which not
 support l10n.

 +1 provided you also touch the file.  Given that it's supposed to be
 recompiled with each build it's not sufficient to just make it use
 __DATE__ and __TIME__.
