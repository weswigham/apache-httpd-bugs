>Description:
Given the following .htaccess file, when "satisfy any" is added after
<Limit POST GET>, all sites gain access to the directory...
(AccessOverride is set to All in access.conf)
Basically "satisfy any" does not work...
----
AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/passwd
AuthName [machine-id]
AuthType Basic

<Limit POST GET>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from [site1]
require user [user1] [user2]
</Limit>
>How-To-Repeat:
duplicate the above .htaccess file replacing [variable] with appropriate
data...
>Fix:
fix "satisfy any" to work as the documentation suggest

State-Changed-Why:
I've had trouble reproducing this - I tried a config just
as you suggested, and "satisfy any" worked completely as
expected.  

If you're still seeing the problem, could you send me, via 
private email, your access.conf, and all .htaccess files in 
the directories above the current directory?  It's possible the
"satisfy any" is acting upon access control rules in higher 
directories.
