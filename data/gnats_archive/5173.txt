>Description:
When using ErrorDocument, MSIE 5.0 generates a client "404 Not Found"
error page instead of redirecting to the location specified.
The same action with Netscape seems to work OK.

[OK, so it's a client problem... but...]

MSIE 5.0 seems to be working OK with Microsoft Servers using that have
a similar mechanism in place.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 19 17:52:20 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
That is because Microsoft, in their infinite wisdom,
decided that they know best so they created their own
page to show on common errors.  Not necessarily a bad
idea, but their page is completely useless and removes
all technical info.

You should be able to get around that by spitting out
a response body that is over a certain size.

 Marc,
 Thank you for the quick response.  The world is full of Microsoft wisdom's such as
 this.  Just to clarify what you meant, are you saying that if my error document is
 "large enough" that IE will display my page instead of its own?  The current response
 is about four lines of text.  Including tags and such, it's probably about 512 characters.
 How large is "a certain size"?
 
 
 Regards,
 Bob

 I don't know, give it a try.
 
 You could also try looking at MS's site to see if they document their 
 oddities.

 Marc:
 Now I've seen everything (or at least a little bit more).
 
 I have to admit, when you told me that my error response page
 had to be "longer", I had my doubts.  It sounded to strange.
 But, alas, you are right and it is true.  By trial and error,
 I've ascertained (with no help from Microsoft) that the magic
 number is 1392.  If an error response is 1,392 bytes or longer,
 IE will display the ErrorDocument response from the server rather
 than its own local page.  You might want to put that one in your
 notebook.
 
 Thanks for the help Marc.  If only I could get the kind of response
 from Microsoft that I get from Apache, my life would be a lot easier.
 
 Regards,
 Bob

 Hello Marc,
 This is a follow-up to a dialog we had last week concerning
 MSIE5.0 covering up our ErrorDocument response with its own
 "Friendly" error message.
 
 A a reminder, we had our ErrorDocument set up to run a cgi
 that examined the errant URL and performed a special function
 depending on the value of the URL.  Although our response
 was well over the minimum required according to Microsoft's
 documentation, IE5.0 would display its "Friendly" error message
 instead, thereby nullify our programmed response.  We found that
 we could fix this problem by using an option in IE5's advanced
 settings menu -- called "Turn off friendly HTML error messages".
 By doing this, IE5.0 reliably displayed our custom error response
 instead of the local error message.
 
 We thought we were out of the woods, but then we started getting
 reports from people going through proxy servers that the
 proxy servers are performing in a similar manner - returned their
 own HTTP404 response instead of our custom one.
 
 So, sorry to bother you again, but another question:
 When the Apache server is set up with the ErrorDocument,
 does it still send an indication to the client that a 404
 error occurred (even though it is going to send the ErrorDocument)?
 If so, is there a way to not have it do this?
 
 BTW, when the "Friendly" messages are turned on in IE5.0, the
 problem seems to be highly correlated to the ping time from the
 client to the server.  T1 connections with small ping times
 (<60ns) always work correctly (even with friendly ON).  Medium
 quality connections (60 - 120ns) exhibit the problem occasionally.
 Slow connections (120+) exhibit the problem almost everytime.

 Have your 404 CGI script emit a "Status: 404" or "Status: 200"
 header field as appropriate.
