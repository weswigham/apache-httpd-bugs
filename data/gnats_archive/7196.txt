>Description:
I tried to connect from Jrun 3.0 to apache by using the External Connector Wizard in the Jrun JMC. However when I try to start apache again I get :
Cannot load "c:/program files/allaire/jrun/connectors/apache/intel-win/mod_jrun132.dll

This is what Jrun appended to httpd.conf-

# JRun Settings
# JRun - Comment out this line to disable DSO (ie you compiled module into your server.
LoadModule jrun_module "C:/Program Files/Allaire/JRun/connectors/apache/intel-win/mod_jrun132.dll"
<IfModule mod_jrun.c>
JRunConfig jrun.rootdir "C:/PROGRA~1/ALLAIRE/JRUN"
JRunConfig jvmlist default
JRunConfig Verbose false
JRunConfig ProxyHost 127.0.0.1
JRunConfig ProxyPort 8081
JRunConfig Mappings "C:/Program Files/Allaire/JRun/servers/default/local.properties"
</IfModule>

I changed all forward slashes to backslash but still the same error comes.If I comment out the LoadModule Line the apache server starts but obviously I am unable to connect Jrun to it.
Can anybody pls suggest why this is happening and how to fix it.

Sorry, but you will really need to contact the
vendor of your module for support.  We can only
support the modules included with the Apache
distribution.

Thanks for using Apache!
