>Description:
If mod_bandwidth is loaded as a module, even if it is not used, it will cause  none of the html form POST data to be passed on the STDIN to the cgi which is called using the Action/AddHandler configs. This will prevent PHP from       receiving form POST data if it is run as a cgi instead of as a module.
>How-To-Repeat:
1.
Make sure that mod_bandwidth is loaded:
LoadModule bandwidth_module   modules/mod_bandwidth.so
AddModule mod_bandwidth.c
2.
Set up a handler.
Action test-script /cgi-bin/form.cgi
AddHandler test-script .testcgi
3.
Create a form.cgi script such as:
------------
#!/bin/bash
echo "content-type: text/plain"
echo
env
echo "---- STDIN ----"
cat
---------------

4. Create a file with the extension that will trigger the handler, such as junk.testcgi. It doesn't matter what's in the file, since we won't be processing it.

5. Create a form to post to junk.testcgi.

------- test.html ---------
<form action=junk.testcgi method=POST>
<input type=text name=MYVAR value="foo">
<input type=submit value=submit>
</form>
--------------------------

6. Now when you go to this form and submit it, it will not show any information below the "------STDIN-----" line in form.cgi.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid we have nothing to do with mod_bandwidth, and therefore can do nothing about bugs in it.  You should contact the authors of the module for assistance.

 Hello,
 mod_bandwidth must be given the lowest priority else it will transmit
 documents before others modules can do their job.
 
 If you compile mod_bandwidth into Apache, you can add it with the
 following :
 ./configure --add-module=mod_bandwidth.c --permute-module=BEGIN:bandwidth
 
 If you use the AddModule/LoadModule directive, mod_bandwidth should
 be placed at the begining of the list to give it the lowest priority.
 
 Cheers,
 Yann Stettler
