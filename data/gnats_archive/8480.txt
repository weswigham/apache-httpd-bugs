>Description:
I can reproduce a problem handling the trailing CRLF on POSTs with a tcpdump of a form submitted with Netscape 4.6 under Windows NT 4.0. If you send this request to Apache (I used netcat to reproduce the bug), Apache will return nothing to the sender. Netscape will present a "document contains no data" page to the user.

If I change the Content-Length to +2 Bytes for the extra CRLF or I remove the trailing CRLF, everything works perfect.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a page where you can POST data (like an empty PHP file), adjust the URL in the "POST XXX HTTP/1.0" line and do a netcat -v webserver 80 <netscape_postbug.txt

Here is my netscape_postbug.txt.
(Filesize is 457 bytes, don't forget to save the extra CRLF):
POST /test.php HTTP/1.0

State-Changed-Why:
The submitter adds:

I found out that this problem only occurs when I load a special custom module.
The module itself is doing authentication and some content serving.
It installs a "handler" via the "set handler" directive.
[...]
I've identified the problem: The custom module uses a flag to indicate
if an error has occurred ("errorOccured"). The module checks the flag
in the "[#9] log a transaction" phase of the module and exits
Apache via exit() if it's true.
