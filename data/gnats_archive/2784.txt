>Description:
It would be excellent that in the future that the .htaccess 
referer option could be added as in NCSA. That would enable 
those of us running sites under virtual domains to restrict 
access to certain directories and/or files on a directory 
by directory basis.

Thanks

We have no plans to add that directive.

As documented very clearly in the NCSA compat page you
are told to read before submitting a PR, there are several
other ways to get the same functionality including
mod_rewrite.

 Marc,
 
 It's probably one of those 3:30 in the morning problems, but I can't make
 sense of the mod_rewrite manual. Would you be open to consulting this
 problem for us on fee?
 
 We can have mod_rewite compiled into the server, and just need to know how
 to set up a directory so the files in that directory can only be accessed
 from within our domain, denying all outside links to these files and
 hopefully with a redirect that would send the "offender" to our homepage.
 
 Our domain is a virtual domain and hopefully the rewrite directives could
 be placed into an .htaccess file.
 
 I'd be glad to pay for your expert advice.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tracy
