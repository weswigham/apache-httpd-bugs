Linux 2.2.12-20smp #1 SMP i686 (RedHat Linux 6.1)
>Description:
we have a redhat linux 6.1 server running Apache 1.3.12 using mod_perl. the site is very busy but works normal when it is accessible from external network. the problem is when a major part of internet can't connect to the server properly (at normal speed) the apache seems to hang and doesn't respond. the surprising thing is that at that time apache doesn't respond even if we connect from local host. if we try to restart apache or the server it remains okay for a few seconds but then again it seems to hang from local host. probably it is due to the fact that immediately after restarting there are many requests for apache. we are also using nmap to scan local ports and at the time of hanging of apache, port 80 is shown as filtered. there are no errors in server logs. the settings are: MinSpareServers 20, MaxSpareServers 40, StartServers 30, Maxclients 300 and MaxRequestsPerchild 0. the question is why we can't connect from the localhost when httpd restarts okay without any errors and there is no change in the configuration. the most surprising thing is that things are back to normal when there is no network problem.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Apr 22 01:04:48 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Apache will only handle MaxConnections connections at once.  Once those are all full, you will have some connections be "established" but not served until a child process is free, ones after that will just timeout without opening a TCP connection.

If you are having network problems, then you are probably having lots of clients with connections that are open but not transferring data.  Think about it as if your average time to serve each request goes from 5 seconds to 100 seconds; clearly, that will be a lot heavier load on the server.

This isn't really an Apache issue, it is just the way that the world is.

 many thanks for your urgent reply. the only thing that
 bothered us was that the max clients limit is 300 and
 the server stops responding from localhost when the
 limit hadn't reached at all. it is okay that many
 child processes are taking a lot more time sending the
 data but if the max client limit hasn't reached then
 parent should be able to fork a new process if needed.
