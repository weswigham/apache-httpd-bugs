>Description:
The current logrotate and logresolve have (in my eyes) confusing interfaces. 
I think this is part of the reason neither are installed in 
linux-distributions. (Especially the "when" of logrotate is not human-friendly)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think logrotate should accept a similar "when" configuration as the crontab. 
In addition, if logresolve could be integrated into logrotate, it would be 
possible to start up a separate process which will resolve the names in the 
freshly created old logfile. 
To finish things off, the logfile could then be compressed using the 
compression-tool of your choice.

configuration should be via httpd.conf:
LogrotateResolve Yes/No
LogrotateCompress /usr/bin/bzip2 /usr/bin/gzip

ErrorLog "|/usr/local/apache/bin/rotatelogs /var/log/apache/error_log  00 00 * * mon"
