** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration

** test will give you an idea what is failing. Note that
** Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such as gcc. 

ld.so.1: make: fatal: librt.so.1: version `SUNW_1.2' not found (required by file make)
Killed

 Aborting!

I think that the problem concerns to scripts that check the OS.

State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 21 10:20:05 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This appears to be a problem with the compiler and development tools installation on your solaris box.

The:

ld.so.1: make: fatal: librt.so.1: version `SUNW_1.2' not found (required by
file make)

error is your system saying that it can't run "make" for some reason.  I'm afraid we have no idea what the particular problem on your system is and really can't help you debug your compilation environment...
