>Description:
After compiling 1.3.0 and running, using the DBM inside the .htaccess file, we get 
[Wed Jun 17 11:37:04 1998] [notice] httpd: child pid 332 exit signal Segmentation Fault (11) when the username and password is correct, otherwise it will say "Auth Failed"
Now, if I change the .htaccess to just straight .htpasswd format, works fine.
I have just downloaded 1.2.6 and compiled and ran it and the DBM worked just fine with *NO* changes
to anything else.
After running 1.3.0 and the username and password is correct, it tells us "Document contains no data"
Here is the .htaccess we are using:
AuthDBMUserFile /u2/test.com/userdb/members
AuthType Basic
AuthDBMGroupFile /u2/test.com/userdb/members
AuthName " Members Only "

<LIMIT GET POST PUT>
require valid-user
</LIMIT>
>How-To-Repeat:
http://208.140.93.69 is the test site.
>Fix:
No clue.  I know it works fine with 1.2.6 but 1.3.0 is not working with the DBM

 Are you sure that 1.3.0 is being compiled with gdbm just like you say 1.2
 is?  What does the final link line look like when you type "make"?

 In your post you mentioned "gdbm", but it's not present on the link line
 below... I suspect you're getting dbm functions from libc, and that you
 may have compiled your 1.2.6 server with -lgdbm.  If that's the case the
 seg faults are expected -- the two dbm libraries use different file
 formats.
 
 Try adding EXTRA_LIBS=-lgdbm to your Configuration file, reconfiguring and
 recompiling.

 Ok, here is the new 'make'
 
 <=== modules/proxy
 <=== modules
 gcc -c  -I./os/unix -I./include   -DSOLARIS2=260 -DSTATUS  modules.c
 gcc -c  -I./os/unix -I./include   -DSOLARIS2=260 -DSTATUS  buildmark.c
 gcc  -DSOLARIS2=260 -DSTATUS     \

 modules/standard/libstandard.a  main/libmain.a
   ./os/unix/libos.a  ap/libap.a  -lgdbm -lsocket -lnsl
 bash-2.00# /test/apache_1.3.0/src/httpd -f
 /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
 
 And now it is getting:
 [Thu Jun 18 13:29:00 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: could
 not open dbm auth file: /u2/test.com/userdb/members
 
 *BUT* I can use the following command:
 bash-2.00# dbmmanage /u2/test.com/userdb/members view matrix7
 matrix7:Mx92ZF35YpJCs
 
 Now the gdbm I got was from the www.sunsite.unc.edu in which I go the
 version for my Solaris 2.6 and x86 and copied it into the /usr/local/bin
 (it's already compiled).  That is where I stand.

Comment-Added:
[Comment sent to the database incorrectly, but destined
for this PR.]

I am also getting this same problem.  To summarize:
mod_auth_dbm gives strange errors instead of working.  Affects multiple
platforms, but in different ways.

On my redhat5.2 machine, I get this:

[Mon May  3 17:39:29 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] (2)No such file or
directory: could not open dbm auth file: /usr/local/httpd/conf/spamusers
[Mon May  3 17:39:29 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] DBM user julian
not found: /usr/local/httpd/htdocs

And I actually get a prompt for the password, though nothing I enter
works of course.
On Slackware 4 (with kernel 2.2.5):

[Mon May  3 17:41:05 1999] [notice] child pid 13861 exit signal
Segmentation fault (11)

And no prompt from the browser of course - just a broken pipe message
from junkbuster.
Both places, I'm doing simply:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/httpd --enable-module=auth_dbm

And using the standard /cong/httpd.conf-dist plus this one block:
<location />
AuthType Basic
AuthName "your SpamCop account"
AuthDBMGroupFile /usr/local/httpd/conf/spamusers
AuthDBMUserFile /usr/local/httpd/conf/spamusers
require group spamcop
</location>

And, yes, the -ldbm flag is present during make.

This DBM file is being used currently by my live 1.3.4 version of apache
on the same slackware box, although *that* apache is a binary I compiled
elsewhere long ago.  I'm afraid to recompile or it'll break too - and
anyway I don't want to - I want the new version.

So I created a new DBM file on the slackware box and changed the above
httpd.conf entry to point to it.  I used dbmmanage to create the new
file - first time with this util.  All my other DBMs consist of TWO
files, and this util created ONE.  In the working config, I have
"spamusers.dir" and "spamusers.pag", and I reference them as just
"spamusers" as above.  Now, I get only one file, and a different error:

[Mon May  3 17:54:41 1999] [error] [client 208.12.13.18] (2)No such file
or directory: could not open dbm auth file: /root/test
[Mon May  3 17:54:41 1999] [error] [client 208.12.13.18] DBM user julian
not found: /usr/local/apache/htdocs 

..although noteably similar to the error I get under redhat.  At least
now it dosn't segfault.  I have a CGI system for editing the .pag/.dir
files which uses Perl dbm modules, so I fear changing file formats in
case I run into more compatibility problems there.

What's the difference between the single file system and the dual file
system?  Why won't auth_dbm work with either format on either platform
(and sounds like a few other platforms too)?

Please let me know if you need any help tracking this down.

p.s.  THANK YOU for giving your time to work on this wonderful free
software.
