>Environment:
HP-UX 10.20, Installed depot from the HP-UX software depot, not
compiled myself
>Description:
Apache dies rather silently if it can't write "httpd.pid", e.g. in
/opt/apache/var/run/httpd.pid. The error is only logged in error_log.
Maybe give messages on the console until Apache is really up.
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove the directory for the PID file.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Wed Aug 19 11:06:13 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Apache does log errors on the console until it has opened
the error_log.

Apache can't log the pid until it has detached from the
console, which involves a fork()... which changes its pid.

The error is logged in the error_log, there's not much else
we can do.
