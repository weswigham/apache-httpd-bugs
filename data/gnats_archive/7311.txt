>Description:
if servlet's doGet method uses code where you try return from within
synchronized block:
	synchronized(foo){
		...
		if(condition) return;
		...
	}
you will receive exception in runtime - something like that: invalid word 
<return>

	
>How-To-Repeat:
yes, always
>Fix:
no, only if you will change your code:
	boolean needReturn = false;
 	synchronized(foo){
		...
		if(condition) needReturn = true;
		if(!needReturn){
			...
		}
	}
	if(needReturn) return;
