SunOS chambord 5.8 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-250
gcc 2.95.3
>Description:
Did a vanilla configure/make/make install on this platform.  When trying
to start httpd, it hangs before making any real progress (nothing in logs,
etc.)  adb showed program was consistently hanging in this chain:

_get_hostserv_inetnetdir_byname(ffbef6ac,ffbef6b4,0,ffbef6b4,ff29ae30,8d8d1) + 224
getipnodebyname(0,0,88bd0,ffbef72c,8d8d0,d1e90) + 12c
get_addr(0,8d8d0,ffbef8a0,1,ff2fa000,50) + c4
getaddrinfo(ff2fac0c,8d8d0,50,ffbef924,ff2fa000,ffbef8a0) + 524
apr_sockaddr_info_get(dd59c,8d8d0,8,98,0,8f5b8) + 11c
ap_mpm_pod_open(0,84eac,1a,1,ff3e0000,ff37023c) + 78
prefork_open_logs(8f5b8,c7698,c96a0,84c00,43ba8,0) + 54
ap_run_open_logs(0,c7698,c96a0,91e98,83800,0) + 50
main(8d630,8f5b8,0,83800,ffbefb24,83000) + 4cc

This appears to be related to the code trying to use IPv6 by default
(hostname passed to getaddrinfo is "::"), though we don't use that
for any production purposes on this system.  Hardcoding server address
in httpd.conf helped, as did manually setting APR_HAVE_IPV6 to 0 in apr.h
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Hangup seems to be related to specific parameters passed to getaddrinfo.
Debug stmts show first call to this function succeeds with no problem.
Don't know if this may be a Solaris bug, but will be glad to do more
testing if that would help.  (Maybe it's hanging because we don't have 
any IPv6 stuff defined?  But it's going to be confusing when the server
chokes and the admin isn't suspecting this is the reason.)

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 22 14:08:51 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
This is caused by a bug in the Solaris 8 resolver library.
A fix is available from Sun.  If you install the current Solaris 8 recommended patch cluster you will get the Solaris fix for this problem.
