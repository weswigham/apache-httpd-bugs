>Description:
With the following setup index.cgi is not
presented but a 403 with
  attempt to invoke direct ory as script: /var/www/cgi-bin
in the error_log.

  DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi
  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/net/httpd/cgi-bin/
  <Directory /home/net/httpd/cgi-bin>
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
  </Directory>

However with this (s/Script//m) the desired
behavior is acheived. It is not-obvious that
this seemingly inconsequential change is
critical for this. The documentation infers
that ScriptAlias = Alias + an otherwise empty
Directory directive with Options ExecCGI.

  DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi
  Alias /cgi-bin/ /home/net/httpd/cgi-bin/
  <Directory /home/net/httpd/cgi-bin>
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
  </Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
See Full Description.
>Fix:
Fix mod_alias or change the documentation.
