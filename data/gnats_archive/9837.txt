>Description:
The error logging in the newer versions of apache leaves much ot be desired... Is there ANY way that critical errors that will keep apache from starting could be logged to a single place? It can be a huge problem trying to find an error somewhere on a server with hundreds of virtual hosts when an error in one host will keep the server from starting. We had a client who's httpd log directory was moved and that one missing directory kept httpd from running. It took quite a while to find out what the problem was, and httpd was no help.... A lot of things happen here over the course of a day and it's not always possible to remember everything that has happened. A central log file for critical errors would be a real nice thing....
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, create a special log folder for a virtual host and then remove it. The srever will not start and there will be no errors except in a virtual host error log in the default logging directory.
>Fix:
Log any critical errors to syslog or the httpd error_log, or maybe a new critical_log file. It would make problems MUCH easier to find...
