>Description:
While trying to compile mod_auth_pam.c as described in the apxs manual (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/programs/apxs.html), I get this error - apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=255.

bash-2.03# /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -c -lpam -ldl mod_auth_pam.c
cc -DSOLARIS2=260 -DUSE_EXPAT -I../lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED  -I/usr/local/a
pache/include  -c mod_auth_pam.c
"mod_auth_pam.c", line 405: warning: initialization type mismatch
  -o mod_auth_pam.so mod_auth_pam.o -lpam -ldl
apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=255 

also tried doing this compile by having apxs make the makefile using the following:
$apxs -g -n pam_auth
$make
/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -c   -L/usr/lib -lpam -ldl mod_pam_auth.c
cc -DSOLARIS2=260 -DUSE_EXPAT -I../lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED  -I/usr/local/a
pache/include  -c mod_pam_auth.c
  -o mod_pam_auth.so mod_pam_auth.o -L/usr/lib -lpam -ldl
apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=255
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `mod_pam_auth.so'   


Why is this happening??

>How-To-Repeat:
You can repeat problem by going to the /src/modules/example directory in apache and do the following:
$apxs -g -n example
$make
/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -c    mod_example.c
cc -DSOLARIS2=260 -DUSE_EXPAT -I../lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED  -I/usr/local/a
pache/include  -c mod_example.c
  -o mod_example.so mod_example.o
apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=255
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `mod_example.so'

Comment-Added:
I saw this today on Linux, AIX, and FreeBSD.  For an unknown
reason, the first time apache 1.3 is built apxs can be left
with the variables for CFLAGS_SHLIB, LD_SHLIB, and LDFLAGS_SHLIB
uninitialized.

If I remove src/support/apxs and run make again, apxs gets
built properly.

I have no idea what the cause is.  In fact, once it is built
properly I can't figure out how to get it built improperly
again :(

Do you have any more clues to the problem by now?
