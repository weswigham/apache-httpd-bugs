>Environment:
Debian 2.1 (Linux 2.0.36)
>Description:
When replacing an alternative webserver which has user tracking cookies with
apache, it would be nice to be able to set the name of the cookies consumed and
generated by mod_usertrack so that you can continue to make use of existing
user tracking cookies that have been generated by the prior webserver.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have done a patch which adds a configuration item called "CookieName".
Patch is available at: http://marvin.nipltd.com/~matt/mod_usertrack.patch

State-Changed-Why:

A CookieName directive has been added, though the work
was done independently of your patch.  The new directive
should appear in the next release after 1.3.6.
Thanks for using Apache!
