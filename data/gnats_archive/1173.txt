>Description:
A database frontend was set up through the Apache 1.2.1 webserver.
This frontend connects a mSQL database in order to update it. User
authorization is done using the mod_auth_msql module.

The database frontend is setup as a frameset (of 2 frame) of which
the right frame contains a menu and the left contains the FORMS
pages, which allow updating data items. 

As I can see in the access log file, the HTTP server prompts for the
user name an  the password, authorizes the user and returns either
the frameset as well as the right frame to that user. The CGI script,
which is contained in the left frame is called without the authorized
user environment variable (REMOTE USER) being set up accordingly. The
log file shows the following

gate.class.de - admin [29/Sep/1997:12:46:18 +0200] "GET /Admin/ HTTP/1.0" 200 644
gate.class.de - admin [29/Sep/1997:12:46:19 +0200] "GET /Admin/right.html HTTP/1.0" 200 1032
gate.class.de - - [29/Sep/1997:12:46:20 +0200] "GET /Gifs/syslog1.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 14677
gate.class.de - - [29/Sep/1997:12:46:20 +0200] "GET /cgi-bin/nph-count?width=5&link=/admin.html HTTP/1.0" 200 1759
gate.class.de - "" [29/Sep/1997:12:46:22 +0200] "GET /cgi-bin/Admin/main.pl HTTP/1.0" 200 1952
gate.class.de - - [29/Sep/1997:12:46:22 +0200] "GET /Headgrafs/01.gif HTTP/1.0" 404 169


As you can see in the 5th line, instaed of the user name, an empty string is
shown for the CGI request.

This problem was not present in Apache 1.1.1. It first occured when we updated
to Apache 1.2.1.
>How-To-Repeat:
There's no site containing this bug which is public available. The database
is mission-critical, so I'm not allowed to pas you a password.

State-Changed-Why:
I believe your problem is due to a misunderstanding.  The
CGI script is treated as a completely separate request,
and since it's coming from /cgi-bin/ it isn't in the
same authorisation realm as the rest of the information,
and so isn't being passed any authorisation data because
/cgi-bin/ doesn't require any.

Try putting your CGI script into a directory under your
/Admin/ location so it will require the same authorisation
information, and I think you'll see the remote username
become available.  Remember to rename it to "nph-count.cgi"
and refer to it by that name, and ensure that your config
files include a "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi" line.  Or
you can add another ScriptAlias directory under the /Admin/
location, put the script there, and not have to rename it.

Please let me know how this affects your problem.
