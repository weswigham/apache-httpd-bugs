SunOS sinistar 5.5 Generic_103093-06 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20
>Description:

  DATE_LOCAL in an ssi echo command was printing May 6 when it was still May 5. Couldn't
figure out what was wrong or how to change the effective time zone of the server,
so we just restarted it. error_log has:

[Wed May  6 00:21:15 1998] [notice] httpd: caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[Tue May  5 23:21:31 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3b5 configured -- resuming normal operations

now. We were in EST/EDT up until 4-5 months ago, so I thought maybe the server was set to
the wrong time zone. However, it appears this was a one time problem and not
a recurring one. No idea if it has happened in the past, I don't believe
so. But it did tonight. We use DATE_LOCAL and ssi to set a filename to print the current 
image for the day, and we had a broken link tonight after 11pm since the web server 
was an hour ahead of the crontab that makes the files...
>How-To-Repeat:
I can't repeat it, it just happened out of the blue. Someone 
suggested "they may call time twice and assume the first digit 
doesn't change between them" but I have no idea myself. Our server isn't too fast
and has a slow startup from lots of fastcgi static processes. I restarted the
server with:
kill pid; sleep 2; /web/bin/httpd -f /web/conf/httpd
but that alone won't repeat it.
>Fix:
I restarted the server and the time (or timezone) was correct.

 When did this start happening?  Was it when Apache was started or while it
 was running?
 
 Are you sure no one with their on TZ environment variable set started
 Apache at any time?
 
 I am really doubtful that Apache is doing anything wrong because it just
 uses the OS's supplied routines...

   I believe the time was wrong during the whole web server execution. TZ is
 set to US/Central which is the right time zone. This problem may very well
 never happen again, but I figured I'd report it in case someone else ever
 experiances it as well, as an additional data point.

   This has happened again. A page using a xssi generated filename is broken
 because the web server has jumped 1 hour into the future.

   From server-status
 
    Current Time: Mon May 18 00:47:21 1998
    Restart Time: Fri May 15 18:15:45 1998
    Server uptime: 2 days 6 hours 31 minutes 36 seconds
    Total accesses: 176320 - Total Traffic: 1.0 GB
 
   I can't spot where it happened or for how long this has been going on
 since the server started. It could be a OS or hardware clock problem, I
 don't know. But what I do know is the current clock time is correct and
 httpd is ahead by 1 hour, which happened when I first reported this. I
 restarted it and now see this on server-status:
 
    Current Time: Sun May 17 23:56:34 1998
    Restart Time: Sun May 17 23:56:30 1998
    Server uptime: 4 seconds
    Total accesses: 0 - Total Traffic: 0 kB
 
   Still running 1.3b5. Can move to b6 immediately if anyone thinks it might
 impact this. :(
