I could not stop httpd and had to reboot back into 1.3.14 because this is a heavily utilized production server.

 I have Windows Me installed and tried Apache 1.3.20. I have Personal Web
 Server on port 80 and I set Apache to listen port 8080 in order to run both
 web servers in a time.
 Apache seems to create a system crash and I am forced not only to reset, but
 also to switch off power because the pc refuse to shutdown.
 In your view could it depends on incompatibility with WinMe?
