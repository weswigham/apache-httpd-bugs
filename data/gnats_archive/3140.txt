>Release:        1.3.2
>Environment:
Win NT 4 SP3
>Description:
Substitution only supports a limited number of schemes, namely http:, https:, ftp: and gopher:.
RewriteEngine therefore cannot be used with other schemes like news: or mailto:.

>How-To-Repeat:
Add this to a config file:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/mail mailto:webmaster@apache.org [R,L]
>Fix:
Check for schemename':' (and the special mod_rewrite schemes) rather than a fixed set of schemes.

State-Changed-Why:
Please give an example of a URL you would expect to trigger
the rewrite rule:

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^/mail mailto:webmaster@apache.org [R,L]

What would you expect it to do, and what does it do instead?

 Synopsis: Substitution does not support some schemes
 State: open
 
 : Please give an example of a URL you would expect to trigger
 : the rewrite rule:
 :
 :   RewriteEngine On
 :   RewriteRule ^/mail mailto:webmaster@apache.org [R,L]
 
 http://localhost/mail (probably with some RewriteCond in the
 configuration but for reproducing the problem this is not required)
 
 : What would you expect it to do, and what does it do instead?
 
 I would expect a redirect, i.e. Status 302 and
 Location: mailto:webmaster@apache.org headers, to be sent as for equivalent 
 RewriteRules with other schemas, instead mod_rewrite searches for
 ${DOCUMENT_ROOT}/mailto:webmaster@apache.org and not finding that document 
 sends a 404 Not Found.
 
 RewriteRule ^/mail http://www.domain.com/redirect.pl?url=mailto:webmaster@apache.org works okay.
 
 hook_uri2file has a hardcoded list of schemas (http://, https://, gopher://, 
 ftp://), all other schemas are interpreted as local files (including common 
 ones like file:, news:, mailto: and ldap: but also any other schema).
