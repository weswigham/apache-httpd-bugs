Apache
>Description:
Cookies cannot be set using SSI to run a CGI script. It works invoking the script directly, but not via SSI. It seems that the headers are not passed through to the browser when using server side includes but are completely ignored. Cookies can be read in, but not set. (???)
>How-To-Repeat:
Use SSI to invoke a script that sets a cookie.
>Fix:
Yes, allow the headers from the script to go through with the page headers as the document is parsed.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Mon Jun 12 22:33:32 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Cookies have to be sent in the HTTP header.  By the time
Apache gets to the SSI, the HTTP header has been sent.
Apache can not and will not do what you want.  It is not a bug.
