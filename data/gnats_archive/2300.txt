State-Changed-Why:

How do you try to access your web server (what client are
you using).
What error is logged in the error.log?

 I have used Netscape Navigator 4.05 for win95 and lynx for Solaris and
 tried telnetting to port 80 and typing in the commands by myself.
 Nothing in the error log.

 I figured it out. I still had an old proxy server running that didn't
 show up when I hit Ctrl-Alt-Del. I found it using one of _gasp_
 Microsoft's _features_ that shows every running application. I then
 proceeded to delete the proxy server and everything ran fine. Thanks for
 the help. Someone might think about putting this in a FAQ somewhere for
 Win32 Apache.
