>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 
>Description:
When I try to compile the htpasswd.c file in the src/support directory 
I am getting errors that I do not know how to fix.  I am trying to use
Borland 5.01 C++ to compile because I do not have access to UNIX.  I have used 
the URL http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth as a guide for installing 
user level access on the server.  So far I have tried many resources and can not 
get the htpasswd.c file into an exe that I can run from NT.  My server is shut 
down now until I get this resolved, so please help me with this problem!!
>How-To-Repeat:
The server is behind a firewall and it only for internal use.
>Fix:
Please compile a Windows vertion of the htpasswd.c program, also it would be very helpful it you know a URL with instruction for configuring this on an NT workstation.

htpasswd.c is already pre-compiled in the 1.3.6 binary
distribution. Is it not available in bin/htpasswd.exe?
