>Description:
I set up the following rules in httpd.conf to deny nimda and code red/blue attacks:

SetEnvIf Request_URI "cmd\.exe" ATTACK
SetEnvIf Request_URI "root\.exe" ATTACK
SetEnvIf Request_URI "default\.ida" ATTACK

CustomLog /var/log/httpd/attack_log common env=ATTACK
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/access_log common env=!ATTACK
...
<Location />
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    Deny from env=ATTACK
    ErrorDocument 403 "
</Location>
<Location /scripts/>
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    ErrorDocument 403 "
</Location>

With this rule set, I would expect any URI referencing root.exe, default.ida, or cmd.exe, as well as anything in the scripts directory, to log a 403 record with 0 byte output to the attack_log file.  This works for almost all the attacks in the typical nimdA sequence, but there are a few URIs which consistently give 400 or 404 errors:

The whole point of my ruleset is to avoid sending any response back to a nimdA infected server, so as not to consume any of my (limited) upstream bandwidth.  As written, it should be 100% effective; in reality it only works 81% of the time (13 out of 16 URIs).
>How-To-Repeat:
Add aforementioned rules to httpd.conf, then expose server to nimdA attack or manually enter offending GET command via telnet.
>Fix:
not really :(

A user-defined ErrorDoc directive for a given Location should supercede any built-in or default error messages.

State-Changed-Why:
Please see PR8625.  The 404's and 400's are not incorrect. These worms are deliberately sending requests designed to foul up request processing.  Some really are bad requests, so 400 is the correct response; similar issues apply with 404.
