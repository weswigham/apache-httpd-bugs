>Environment:
Apache 1.3.1
JServ 19980908
Windows NT V 4.0 Service Pack 3
Sun's jdk 1.1.6 
>Description:
In the Configurations Class method Enumeration getList(String), if the
key is not present when calling getVector(String, Vector) - the default
is used (argument #2) as the return value.  In this case, the default
value is a null and the reference to elements() is invalid.

>How-To-Repeat:
Yes.  Simply comment out a required property from jserv.properties such as
security.allowedAddresses.
>Fix:
this snippet may be useful and appears to work:
public Enumeration getList(String key) {
  Vector v = this.getVector(key, null);
  if (v != null)
     return v.elements();
  else
     return null;
}
