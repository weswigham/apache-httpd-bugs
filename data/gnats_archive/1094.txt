>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0,  SP3, VC++ 5.0 (Enterprise Ed)
>Description:
When the status module is loaded in access.conf, and a handler
is setup for it (I used /server-status), the following text is reported:
--
To obtain a full report with current status information and DNS and LOGGING status codes you need to recompile Apache after adding the line 
Rule STATUS=yes
into the file Configuration 
--

The Configuration file has this rule set by default.
>How-To-Repeat:
Load the status module:
LoadModule status_module modules/ApacheModuleStatus.dll

Set a location:
<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status

order allow,deny
allow from all
</Location>

Access the /server-status page.
>Fix:
I'm afraid not

 Did you try following the directions? i.e. edit your Configuration doing
 what it says.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache does not use the Configuration file when running under Windows,
and the makefiles provided do not set STATUS as Configure would if so told.
We should either change the warning message, or change the Windows default to
use the full status report (perferable).

This should be addressed for 1.3b1.

 I did, although I didn't expect much change -- Apache 1.3a1 ships
 with the Configuration set that way.  I received mail from
 akosut@hyperreal.org that explains the problem; it's excerpted
 at the bottom of this message.
 
 I've found Apache to be completely stable under Windows NT thus 
 far, remarkably so for an alpha piece of software.  Kudos to all
 involved.  I've used Apache under Unix for some time now and am
 looking forward to a similarly excellent,  release quality product
 for NT.
 
 Cheers,
 Nick Silberstein
