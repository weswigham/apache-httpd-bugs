>Description:
httpd can read files from /usr/local/apache/htdocs folder
i.e. http://localhost/index.html reads just fine, but
http://localhost/singles/index.html gives me a 403 error
singles is a ln -s made link:
---------
[root@server htdocs]# pwd
/usr/local/apache/htdocs
[root@server htdocs]# ls -l singles
lrwxrwxrwx    1 nobody   nobody         29 Oct 16 06:47 singles -> /home/singles
/singles/htdocs/
---------
However, If I create a symlink like
lrwxrwxrwx    1 nobody   nobody         29 Oct 16 06:47 boo -> manual
where manual is the doc folder for apache, 
http://localhost/manual/index.html and
http://localhost/boo/index.html work all right
---------
I have FollowSymLinks in my httpd.conf file.
I also have virtual host created on another IP, but neither
http://localhost/singles nor
http://192.168.0.10/ work 
---------

>How-To-Repeat:
try creating a symlink from /usr/local/apache/THESYMLINK
to a home user directory, like /home/$user/htmlfolder.  Theoretically you should not be able to access /home/$user/htmlfolder from the web through the symlink .. 
>Fix:
No, nothing worked so far, so I hope maybe somebody will shine a light on it.. I've tried changed ownership to for symlink and the user directories it was pointing to to root(chown, chgrp), to nobody and to the user himself.  all the files are world-wide readable (I hope, unless there is a specific way to make them that way)  but they are all chmod 0644.  There are no hidden .htaccess files either... I did a find / -name .htaccess as root and didn't find any except one example somewhere deep in perl folders (but that's an irrelevant one)
I also read bug reports 121,480,2477  and tried all the suggestions but they didn't work.
I hope I didn't miss anything.  I also took the httpd.conf file directly from a server where the symlinks work, but for some reason they don't work on my server.
One thing that will work is to delete the symlink, create a directory singles and move all the files from /home/singles/singles/httpd to /usr/local/apache/htdocs/singles  ... but I'd rather not .. unless I really really really have to.  thanks.

State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Mon Oct 16 17:10:13 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

There are many configuration problems that could lead
to an access forbidden message.  The most likely one
in your case is that the web server userid does not
have permissions to get to the file.  In addition
to the actual file, you need to check the permissions
on the directory and all parent directories.
chmod +x /home /home/user (etc)
may be necessary.

Thanks for using Apache.
