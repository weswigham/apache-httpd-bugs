Pentium 90
>Description:
We have upgraded to 1.2.2 and then 1.2.3 this last month and we have had the same problem.

The number of servers dies until only the original server started is running.  A SIGHUP will correct the problem for a short period of time and then it will stop again.

We have set the MinSpareServers to 10 and StartServers to 15.  Once the servers start dieing, the only way to get the dynamic servers to work again is to restart the server using -SIGHUP or kill and a full restart.

There are no messages in the error_log in regards to this problem. 

I could not find anything in any of your bug reports on this problem either.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.
>Fix:
We are now running a cron job that checks the number of servers and if ti drops below a set level, we do an automatic -SIGHUP and this seems to fix the problem for a couple of hours.  Last night (97-08-28) this had to be done 5 times.

State-Changed-Why:
This sounds like you're killing the parent process somehow.
Possibly a cron job or something.  The parent is responsible
for spawning more children ... and I haven't seen this problem
on other linux boxes yet.

If you are absolutely certain the parent is still running
(take a look in logs/httpd.pid to find out the parent's pid)
then try running "strace -p <pid>" against it to see what 
it's up to.

 Parent process is alive and running.  It doesn't die, it is the only 
 process left running.
 
 I have a cron job that counts the number of httpd processes and then 
 restarts the main process by using the following if the count is to low.
 
    kill -HUP `cat /var/run/httpd.pid` 
 
 I will run the strace command and see what else is happening.
 
 This has happened twice in the last day.  It seems to be intermittent.  
 Sep 06 it happened 6 times while twice between then and today.
 
 
 This is what I see when I run the strace -p

 Were those strace results from a server that had stopped spawning new
 children?  I need them from a server that has stopped spawning new
 children ... The ones you sent looked really normal.

 I guess I will have to stop the cron job and wait until it does stop.
 
 It could take a couple of days.
 
 I will get back to you with it as soon as I can get a set.

 Thanks for the pointer but I did an upgrade of the server shortly after 
 the problems occured and all is well now.
