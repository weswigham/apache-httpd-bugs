>Description:
The ap_*_mutex() family of functions are all #define to nothing for
process-based multitasking.  However, these functions appear to exist in
another form within http_main.c, accept_mutex_*() family.  Why #define, when
the code exists in some variant elsewhere within Apache?

Support for the ap_*_mutex() family would facilitate module writers who need to
use and control access to shared memory, such as mod_throttle, in a portable
fashion.

BTW an API for shared memory support would also be nice.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Convert the accept_mutex_*() functions within http_main.c into ap_*_mutex().

State-Changed-Why:
All of this code has been completely rewritten for 2.0 so
this report is no longer relevant. We aren't doing this
kind of maintenance on 1.3.
