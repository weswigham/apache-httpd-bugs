>Description:
Microsoft is claiming that their IIS/ISAPI web server is superior because their CGI is loaded in memory via DLLs. I was wondering if you have heard of anyone writing a similar feature to Apache. (Thanks)

State-Changed-Why:
If they are claiming that ISAPI is faster than CGI they are right,
but apache already supports the Apache API which is equivalent
to ISAPI.

If they are claiming that loading DLLs with some proprietary linkage
is "CGI" ... then they're missing out on the "Common" part of
the "Common Gateway Interface".  This isn't CGI, it may be similar
but unfortunately isn't CGI.  CGI itself is slow, and it's easy to
do better.

For examples of systems which do work with Apache and provide
"CGI-like" functionality with better performance visit
http://www.apache.org/related_projects.html (look at mod_php
and mod_perl), and http://www.fastcgi.com/.
