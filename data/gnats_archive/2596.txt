>Description:
trying to configure 1.3.1-dev (980712) I have the following message
---
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.1-dev
usage: egrep [-hisvwxy] [[-bn]|[c|l|q]] -e pattern_list...
        [-f pattern_file...] [file...]
---
this is not critical since it doesn't stop the configuration process
>How-To-Repeat:
well use a Digital Unix!
>Fix:
maybe by fixing (?) the lines below
[I think a quota ' is missing in front of ^nobody]
---
if [ ".$confadjust" = .1 ]; then
    if [ ".`egrep ^nobody: /etc/group`" != . ]; then
        conf_group="nobody"
        if [ ".`egrep ^nogroup: /etc/group`" != . ]; then
            conf_group="nogroup"
        fi
