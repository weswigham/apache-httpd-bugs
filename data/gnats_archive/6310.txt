Apache v1.2
FrontPage Extensions 4.0
>Description:
I followed the instructions outlined by MS for Q202198 to download and install the FrontPage 4.0 extensions.  At the end, they have you run the script change_server.sh to upgrade Apache Web Server 1.3.1.  After completing the prompts, I got an error stating that it couldn't locate /usr/local/apache/sbin/httpd.  We fixed the problem by creating a softlink by executing "ln -s /etc/httpd apache".  

Now when we attempt "/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start" it reports an error, "Invalid command, LoadModule ... mis-spelled, not found, etc..."??  Has the command changed?

Thanks!
