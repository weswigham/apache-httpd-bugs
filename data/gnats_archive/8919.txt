>Organization:
>Environment:
Win32 - used the precompiled binaries - Installation file apache_2_0_28-beta-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi
>Description:
I've used a test ISAPI extention which I've written. It's only function is to return "hello, you know...". The .dll works fine without caching. When I tried to cache it I've encountered two problems:
1. Documentation - mod_isapi.c DOCS uses both "ISAPICacheFile" and "ISAPIFileCache". The first one is the correct I believe.
2. apache gave me access violation when I tried to start the server. No error log was generated.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the precompiled binaries and try a simple extention. If you want me to send mine, I'll be glad to.
