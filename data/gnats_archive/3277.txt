I read the "sections.html" thoroughly and came to the conclusion that 
<LocationMatch> was overridden by <VirtualHost>.

Scenario:
--------
srm.conf
--------
Alias /protect  /usr/local/protect
ScriptAlias /cgi-protect/  /usr/protect/cgi-protect-me
<LocationMatch "/(protect.*|cgi-protect.*)">
order deny,allow
deny from all
</LocationMatch>

----------
httpd.conf
----------
<VirtualHost xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xx>
blah blah blah
<LocationMatch "/(protect.*|cgi-protect.*)">
AuthDBMUserFile /home/www/customer/.www_pwd
AuthName "Protect_Me"
AuthType Basic
require user user_name
</LocationMatch>

Now whenever I goto http://www.customer.com/protect I get a forbidden response, yet
the explanation of the sections says that the VirtualHost should override the
server config.

Am I misinterpreting something?
>How-To-Repeat:
no url to use.

I hope the above scenario is enough to understand the problem.
>Fix:
To fix my situation -- I remove the <LocationMatch> from the srm.conf file.
I have /protect in the server Alias directive. This leads to an unpleasent 
side-effect of any customer being able to type
http://www.customer21.com/protect 
http://www.customer34.com/protect 
etc....
and not getting asked for authentication, 
unless I go through every VirtualHost and add the <LocationMatch> directive.

I set this as serious, as it should work as per documented.

Thank you for such a wonderful HTTPD server, and to NCSA for getting the ball rolling.
