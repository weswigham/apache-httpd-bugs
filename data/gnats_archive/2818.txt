>Organization:
>Environment:
HP-UX B.10.20 on a 4 processor machine
>Description:
On our HP multiprocessor system there's a software that handles 
packages on different nodes. Therefore this software checks whether
the process is still there, i.e. the daemon remains attached to 
the terminal.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
It would be great to have a startup option similar to the -X option which leads 
to run in single-process mode, but with the change that children can be forked.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem has been solved in Apache 2.0 with the addition
of the environment variable NO_DETACH.  If this is set, then
the server does not detach from the controlling terminal.

Thank you for using Apache.
