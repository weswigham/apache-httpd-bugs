>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 2000 (or any flavor of windows)
>Description:
For Windows, the JVM is not shutdown gracefully because the signal
is sent by mod_jserv using "write()" (function ajpv12_function in file
jserv_ajpv12.c), instead of "send()" for windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
Kill ap_child, wait for it to come back along with the JVM.
Vi the mod_jserv.log file and you'll see:
[01/10/2000 19:39:56:750] (INFO) ajp12: sending shutdown signal
[01/10/2000 19:39:56:750] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: cannot send function

The jserv.log file shows that the request as "Stream closed prematurely"
because no bytes were sent.
>Fix:
Change the following line from (jserv_ajpv12.c:773):
    ret = write( sock, signal, 2);
To:
#ifdef WIN32
    ret = send( sock, signal, 2, 0 );
#else
    ret = write( sock, signal, 2);
#endif
