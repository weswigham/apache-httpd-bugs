>Description:
I have encountered a problem with Apache 1.3.6 installation on Solaris 2.6.

This problem appear during suexec compilation with the message :
ucbcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=260 \
                -DHTTPD_USER=\"www\" \
                -DUID_MIN=600 \
                -DGID_MIN=32 \
                -DUSERDIR_SUFFIX=\"public_html\" \
                -DLOG_EXEC=\"/usr/local/apache/logs/suexec_log\" \
                -DDOC_ROOT=\"/home/vpoubeau/public_html/cgi-bin\" \
                -DSAFE_PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\" \ suexec.c
command line: fatal: cannot open   suexec.c: No such file or directory

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have resolved problem with root Makefile.tmpl correction (diff result) :
191,192c191
<                       -DSAFE_PATH=\"$(suexec_safepath)\" \
<                       ' \

>                       -DSAFE_PATH=\"$(suexec_safepath)\"' \

I hope this message help you.
