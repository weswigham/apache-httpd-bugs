>Description:
The ftp proxy, after connected, parses the url and performs a series of CWDs
to walk the file path.  On Microsoft ftp servers (have not tested on others), if
one of the directories is hidden, the CWD fails with a 550 return code and a file 
not found is returned to the client.  Using direct client against the Microsoft FTP
proxy, the file/directory is found and displayed.  

Another issue suspected is the Micro ftp server does not recognize the SIZE command.
This will then cause problem in determining if the final token of the URL is a file 
or directory item.
>How-To-Repeat:
Site visited is private. 
>Fix:
perform a CWD on the complete URL path name.  If that fails, assume the final token
is a file and execute a simple get on the file.  If the CWD succeeds, perform the 
standard list function.
