>Description:
Per the Apache performance-tuning notes, I am attempting to define some
compile-time switches.  They do not seem to take.  Perhaps due to my
ignorance... but it wouldn't hurt to clarify this in the relevant section!

make -DBUFFERED_LOGS -DHARD_SERVER_LIMIT=600

In the above make, these are simply ignored.  Am I overlooking the obvious?
>How-To-Repeat:
cd /usr/local/apache
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
   --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a \
   --disable-module=include --disable-module=asis \
   --disable-module=actions --enable-module=userdir \
   --enable-module=auth_dbm --enable-module=status \
   --enable-module=rewrite  --disable-module=autoindex \
   --disable-rule=WANTHSREGEX
make -DBUFFERED_LOGS -DHARD_SERVER_LIMIT=600 ; make install ; make clean
>Fix:
I was hoping I could pass compile-time switches through make,
as I do for other builds.  Clarification in the performance
tuning notes would be very helpful.  Is this change the result
of implementing the apaci configuration interface?
