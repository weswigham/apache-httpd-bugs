Apache 1.2.4
>Description:
First I would like to illustrate the problem:

maple 18:06:34 ~/W3/conf
$ ls ..
./      ../     auth/   c2/     cgi/    conf/   doc/    log/    pcgi/

There is a dir "log" instead of the usual "logs".

maple 18:06:35 ~/W3/conf
$ /bin/sh start-apache 
maple 18:06:39 ~/W3/conf
$ open: No such file or directory
Cannot open lock file: /home/geek/W3/logs/accept.lock.16291
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This message is produced from within the routine main and immediately followed
by an exit(1).

maple 18:06:50 ~/W3/conf
$ /bin/pwd 
/home/geek/W3/conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is only for you to see that i am in the right direcory, and the file
system relations do make sense. 


What I would  expect: A directive to tell where to open this file (which I
can't find anymore once Apache is running), or (b) a place in the documentation
mentioning the need for this file.

Solution: I placed a soft link: ln -s log logs
which solved the problem for me.

>How-To-Repeat:

Starting Apache 1.2.4 w/o a dir named "logs" under the ServerRoot should
reproduce the problem.
>Fix:

Yes, mention this in the README or so
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sat Jan  3 09:22:02 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Use the LockFile directive.

Searching the bugdb for the error message would show many
PRs saying this.  It is also listed in the docs and the
CHANGES file.

1.3 will include a sample LockFile directive in the default
config files.
