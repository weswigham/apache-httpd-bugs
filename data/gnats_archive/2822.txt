>Description:
When I compile and start the Apache deamon the child process are assigned to the user #65535 instead of -1 like they are expected to

I'm using the configure command to create the make files.  The command I use is
./configure --prefix=/share/httpd --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a --suexec-enable --suexec-caller=nobody.

There is one warning with the php compilation process with a header file.
it states that compat.h is obsolete and ap_compat.h should be used.

I changed this problem and still receive the same problem.

When the server is started is states
Kill (23413) - No such pid
/my/path/apachectl start : httpd started

The server runs fine except for the user id assigned to the child process.

I tried this on 1.2.4 and got the same problem ( I didn't investigate further)

Do not post to Usenet and submit your bug report hours
later.

As people have already said in response to your usenet posting,
-1 _is_ 65535; it is a shorthand way of specifying the
highest group available.

 Then why does it still give say 65535 when I set the user id to 10?
 
 PS.  Sorry for the Usenet and Bug posting

 Are you sure you changed the setting and restarted the server?
