 Note that, this error is irrelevant from the location of JServ. I tried many different locations with no success.
 Note that, I tried apache with JServ1.1.1 and with JServ1.1.2-2, the same error has been generated.
 
 I tried changing the path to a relative path, it found jserv.conf and then it generated an error about the location of the file ApacheModuleJServ.dll
 i.e. I have put Jserv under Apache folder and in the last line of the file httpd.conf I have used:
 
 # Include the configuration for Apache JServ 1.1.1
 Include "apachejserv1.1.1\conf\jserv.conf"
 
 the error that I got:
