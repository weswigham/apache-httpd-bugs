>Environment:
Sun SPARCStation5 running SunOS 5.5.1
>Description:
access.conf contains:
# Allow server status reports, with the URL of http://servername/server-status
# Change the ".your_domain.com" to match your domain to enable.
 
#<Location /server-status>
#SetHandler server-status

But docs refer to the "status" URL as http://servername/status
See http://www.apache.org/docs/handler.html

This is confusing for (quite) a while as you busily tinker with
SetHandler/AddHandler/... until you eventually see the problem
is in the Location statement :-).

State-Changed-When: Thu Oct 29 12:27:40 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The comment above the <Directory> block enabling
server-status says specifically which path will be used.
However, for consistency's sake, the documentation has been
changed anyway.

Thanks for using Apache.
