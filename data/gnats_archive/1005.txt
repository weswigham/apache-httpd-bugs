From my configuration:
Options MultiViews
AddLanguage en .en
AddLanguage es .es
LanguagePriority es en
----------------------
4 files, 
/var/lib/httpd/htdocs/test.html.es 
/var/lib/httpd/htdocs/test.html.en
/home/regodon/public_html/test.html.es
/home/regodon/public_html/test.html.en
----------------------------------------
This works: http://mydomain.com/test.html
This don't: http://mydomain.com/~user/test.html

The problem probably is related with mod_negotiation or mod_userdir, i haven't
tested redirection.

that MultiViews is really active for your user directories.
