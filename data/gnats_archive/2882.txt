State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid that I can _not_ reproduce the problem you are having.
Since 1.3b5 is an old beta which we don't support any more,
plus we have nothing at all to do with whatever changes
whoever makes to make it run on the Amiga, we can't support
their changes.

My guess would be that perhaps they didn't properly
update their code when the directive was introduced.  You
should contact whoever made the version you are using run
on the Amiga and try to resolve it with them.  It is possible
that it is something in the base Apache code at fault, but
since I can't reproduce your problem it isn't really something
we can debug because of the fact that it isn't Apache, but
someone's modifications to Apache, that you are running.

 Ok, thanks for tha fast answer, but it should work good in original Apache,
 then it MUST
 be the modification in the amiga code.
 
 I should also say that the amiga version works fine (just this bug), and
 apache is a great server to work with,
 but I miss the GUI, another question, do you know if anyone made any cgi's for
 administrating the apache through a browser?

 Well, this PR is already closed, but the explaination to this problem might
 be that in Bert Vortman's 1.3b3 the ap_os_canonical_filename() wasn't
 implemented, but a couple of hacks in main/util.c instead. This is fixed in
 the meantime; there is a (nearly) working 1.3.3 on Aminet (I'm responsible
 for that), the remaining troubles are at exit when transmissions are killed
 and have to do with fork() missing on Amiga.
 
 By the way: what about adding a partial Amiga support to Apache? What I am
 thinking of is creating an os/amiga directory and populating it with os.h,
 os.c, os-inline.c and Makefile.tmpl and adding a few lines to src/configure.
 
 And a os-amiga bug report directory would be fine - all entries could be
 forwarded to Bert Vortman (animal@casema.net), Jeff Shepherd
 (jshepher@mks.com) and me (Ruediger.Kuhlmann@stud.uni-karlsruhe.de).
 
 If anyone can tell me whether ap_os_canonical_filename() is expected to
 shrink path/path/./path/path to path/path/path/path and /foo/bar/../path
 to foo/path, I could contribute the files for os/amiga.
 
 By the way: can someone remove my stupid PR #3203? I didn't know about
 ap_os_c_f() at that time either... I apologise for that.
 
 Thank you very much.
 
 Yours, R=FCdiger.
