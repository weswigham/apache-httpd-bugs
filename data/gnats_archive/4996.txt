>Description:
When using dynamic mass vhosting, mod_vhost_alias doesn't seem to do anything 
if the servename sent by the client contains uppercase characters. 

For example www.MyDomain.com is not recognized as www.mydomain.com.

It's not just a problem of not being able to match the URL to the right 
directory, because I've tried changing the dir-name, and Apache is still unable
match the example above.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.softcontrol.nl, though I'm gonna try some workarounds or even dive
into the sourcecode a bit, so this may no longer show the problem.

This is my (very simple) config for the vhosts:

<VirtualHost 195.86.128.34>
        VirtualDocumentRoot /usr/local/webservers/%0/public_html
</VirtualHost>

State-Changed-Why:
I can't duplicate this problem and your web server isn't
running so I can't test that. Do you still have this 
problem with 1.3.12?
