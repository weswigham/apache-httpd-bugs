>Description:
I'm attaching a couple of changes I've made to my Jserv code (my changes prefixed with //pb).  Wondering if
they have already been made the main codebase (or if they've already been
addressed).

Also: I've got a MultipartRequest class that implements HttpServletRequest
(so it can deal with files uploaded from forms).  THis is based on Jason
Hunters class with a few changes to get it to implement the
HttpServletRequest interface and fix a couple of bugs.  If interested,
please contact me.  I do not subscribe to this list.

In ExtendedProperties.PropertiesReader readProperty():

                while (true) {
                    String line = readLine();
                    //pb
                    if(line==null) {
                        return null;
                    }
                    line = line.trim();

In JservConnection.parseParams()

        //pb
        String contentType = getContentType();
        // Parse any posted parameters in the input stream
        Hashtable postParameters = null;
        if ("POST".equals(getMethod()) &&
            //"application/x-www-form-urlencoded".equals(contentType)) {
            //pb - to get around character encodings after content-type
            // (e.g. M9 sends Content-type:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=ISO-8859-1)

 this isn't needed because it is already in a try/catch NPE which returns
 null.
