Hey,
I just read your whole documentation and it took for EVER! and i download the program and I couldn't make heads or tales on it!
1)What the hell does it do? Is a password program or what?
2)How do u use it?

I couldn't make HEADS or TAILS of that documentatio and I know ALOT about computers.

Isn't there anyway you could make it a bit more user friendly? I'm trying to make a password protected page on my Homepage and i keep getting the error
ServerRoot must be a valid dir.

What the hell does that mean? I put the dir of my homepage..
I even changed to be on my h/d an then i get ServerName is wrong.

Please send me an example or something that can help
Thanks
Kermit

State-Changed-Why:

If you don't know what Apache does, why are you trying
to run it?  It's a Web server; if you want to know
more, see <http://www.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html>.

As for the rest of your report, please [re-]read the
FAQ at <http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html> and
consult the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix USENET
newsgroup.  You're not reporting any bugs in the Apache
software, so your query for more information doesn't
belong in the bug database.
