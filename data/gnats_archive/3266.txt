>Description:
I am running 2 httpd daemons in a SCO5 Server
httpd-mysite daemon is running with his own /etc/conffiles and
httpd-virtuals daemon is running with another /etcvirt/conffiles

in the first case, I have a line defined in /etc/srm.conf with the following
line
ErrorDocument 404 /noexist.htm
and when a document is tried to be accessed and it is not found, it is
redirected to noexist.htm, this is what this line is for.

But, in the case of httpd-virtuals I don't have this line defined in
/etcvirt/srm.conf file or any other .conf files for virtuals.
and if a file in some of my virtual servers is tried to be accessed, the
redirection to noexist.htm is done, receiving errors in my virtual-error_log
about /noexist.htm not found.

I think the redirection in this case should'nt be done in my virtuals, but
is happening.

Any Experience with this situation ? Bug ?

User solved problem; was putting a directive in srm.conf

 I solved my problem putting the directive
 ErrorDocument in httpd.conf, not in srm.conf
 whet I start the daemon with
 httpd-mysite everything is readed from /etc, this is ok.
 BUT
 httpd-virtuals etcvirt/httpd.conf
 the srm.conf is readed from /etc not from /etcvirt
 
 I didn't want my virtual servers to execute this directive, So I put the
 directive in /etc/httpd.conf
