>Description:
Hi,

on my apache Server I put a big pdf File (500K) and if I try to get it with MSIE 5.5 or Netscape 4.5 > the browser crashes. I take the PDF file and put it on a Sun and everything worked fine. If I used the Save as... with my apache and open the PDF File locality everything works fine. I got no error in the logs and I thing it will be transfered complete. Other PDF Files smaller than 500K work fine. I asked in the usenet and nobody could help me.... Does anybody know this problem? Can you help me?

Thanx,

David
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.svo.de/pdf/jugend_forscht/optaktiv.pdf will not work, but http://www.successnet.de/showroom/jugend_forscht/optaktiv.pdf will work... it is both the same file
