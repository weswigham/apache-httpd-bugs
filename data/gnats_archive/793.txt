>Environment:
SunOS sandnews 5.5 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20
cc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
In running some buggy perl scripts using the Apache Perl Module I noticed
that RLimitCPU and RLimitMEM were not helping prevent run-away
programs from chewing up horrible amounts of system resources.

>How-To-Repeat:
Just use a perl script with an infinite loop of some kind,
eating memory for good measure.

>Fix:
Modify the function child_main in the file http_main.c
so that it calls the setrlimit functions. 

I have made these modifications myself, creating a common
procedure which can be called by child_main and call_exec
so as to minimize codesize and duplication in the source.

My apache patches are available at
