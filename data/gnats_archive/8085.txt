>Environment:
AIX version 4.3.3.0, patch level 07, C compiler is installed on the server.  I downloaded the code from your website and then did the configure, make make install.
>Description:
I have installed apache on two systems previously with no problems.  This one has me stumped. All I can figure is the install didnt work correctly but after re-install I get the same error trying to start apache.  Heres the error:

# ./apachectl start
Syntax error on line 296 of /usr/local/bin/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Expected </Directory> but saw </Directory>
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

Heres the config file section it refers to:

  +293  <Directory />
  +294      Options FollowSymLinks
  +295      AllowOverride None
  +296  </Directory>

As you can see the syntax is correct (And the unmodified system default file).  If you remove this portion entirely from the file....it fails on the next occurence of <Directory in the file.

We have tried everything we can think of and as I said even re-installed...but the error remains the same.

If you could help it would be much appreciated.

Sincerely,

Paul Queen
