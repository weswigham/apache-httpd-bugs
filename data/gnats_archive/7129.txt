>Release:        1.3.14
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Novell Netware 5.1 SP1, using the precompiled binaries.
>Description:
Neither the /CGI-BIN/ directory or the cgi-script handler is working. It seems that mod_cgi.c is not compiled in. I didn't find any documentation on this, also Apache 1.3.12 seems to have this problem.

The CGI-BIN directory returns the default directory listing, and not status 500.


Also I didn't find any HTML documentation on the Netware-specific SecureListen directive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache 1.3.14 on your Novell Server and try to access /cgi-bin ...

 Also tried Apache 1.3.17, doesn't work again ...
 
 It seems that the mod_cgi module is not compiled in the binary distribution=
 .
