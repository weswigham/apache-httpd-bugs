>Description:
When I try to connect to my server (with http://klarinetti.atm.tut.fi/), I get HTTP 404 file not found. I've tried with and without DirectoryIndex in httpd.conf. But when I connect with: http://klarinetti.atm.tut.fi/index.html, all works out fine. I've tried with different DocumentRoot directives too. But it should display what's in a DocumentRoot directory even without any html-file in it, shouldn't it?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think it's in configuration files, but I've gone through manuals and webpages and everything.
