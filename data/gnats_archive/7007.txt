>Description:
Not sure if this is actually a bug, but I'm completely stuck and no clue
on how to proceed.
Basically I have a module that has content handler to handle a mime type
that I define.  Within the handler, I do user authentication and set a cookie
in the headers_out table to keep the session info.  Then I want to redirect
the user to a page.  The form that invokes this content handler does a post
and the plugin gets the user name and password from it.  The handler does the
following

      get post data
      authenticate user
      ap_table_set(r->headers_out,"Set-Cookie","session=...");
      ap_table_set(r->headers_out,"Location","someU_url");
      return REDIRECT;

The redirection is working fine, but the cookie is being sent back to the
browser.  Should the redirect also send back the cookie?  I know the cookie
is set correctly because if I do ap_send_http_header(r), the cookie is sent.
I also tried the following
     
      ap_table_set(r->headers_out,"Set-Cookie","session=...");
      ap_send_http_header(r);
      ap_table_set(r->headers_out,"Location","someurl");
      return REDIRECT;

This doesn't work either.  I've tried various ways, using subrequest, internal
redirect, etc. to try redirecting the user to another page and send back
the cookie at the same time.  Nothing seems to work.  Is calling
ap_send_http_header the only way to send back a cookie?  If so, how can
I do a redirect following a ap_send_http_header?
>How-To-Repeat:
write a simple module that handles a post request from a form.  Set a cookie
in the content handler, then do a redirect.
