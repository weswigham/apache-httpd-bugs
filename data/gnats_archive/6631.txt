>Description:
Making configure :
./configure --enable-proxy --enable-so --enable-rewrite

Everythings seems ok.. 

But Make : 

make 
...
make[3]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/apache_2.0alpha6/src/modules/proxy'

This is a critical bug..

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Sat Oct  7 20:22:59 PDT 2000
