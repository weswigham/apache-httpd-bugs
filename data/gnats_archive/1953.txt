State-Changed-Why:
Are you saying you set a specifig login in the "log on as"
entry in the services entry for Apache in the control panel?

Does it work when you run it under the system account?

 It wouldn't run as a service at all, not with any account.  I created
 the account in the domain, not just on the local machine, and it seems
 to work.

State-Changed-Why:
Submitter reports that creating domain account appears to
work.  Probably some NT issue, but who knows... it works
anyway.
