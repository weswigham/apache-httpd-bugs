Good day,

After looking at many of the newer commercial webservers, I have noticed one
common feature being added to all of them.  This feature is the addition of a
CORBA orb to the webserver, to allow the server to create an Object Web in a
sense.  I was wondering if any plans were in the works for adding this 
functionality to Apache in the future?  There are several GPL'd ORBs out there,
as well as ones with a copyright similar to Apache's, so it should be at least
doable.

State-Changed-Why:
I doubt it would be integrated into Apache.  But it could certainly
be done with a module.  Such a thing would be third-party... but if it's
popular like the java and mod_perl projects then it could be "endorsed"
like they are.
