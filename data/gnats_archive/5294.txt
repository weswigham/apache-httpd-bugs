State-Changed-Why:
Do you have a perl interpreter installed on your system?
You need one and the #! line needs to point to perl.exe.
I also recommend you read the FAQ. It has good information
for configuring Apache to run CGIs. Also try asking on
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows. This is almost
certainly a configuration problem.
