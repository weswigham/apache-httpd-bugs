Apache JServ 1.0b2-Apache 1.3.3.exe with ApacheJServ1.0b2.jar replaced by ApacheJServ1.0b3.jar

All was installed using the xxx-win32.exe files when possible.
>Description:
Apache is OK (even as a NT service)but I've got trouble when I try to launch 
ApacheJServ (LoadModule) : an error message says "bad entry-point in ApacheCore.DLL,
 _ap_pclosesocket@8 is missing" ; in Apache/ApacheCore.dll,there is only "_ap_pclosesocket".

I could find _ap_pclosesocket@8 in Apache JServ/ApacheCore.dll but I
can't simply replace the Apache one by the Apache JServ one. I tried but
I'm afraid this is not the solution.

 You are using apache 1.3.6, but you tried to install a copy of Apache JServ
 that has the .dll compiled for 1.3.3. Of course it isn't going to work.
 
 Replace your .dll with one that you FTP downloaded from
 <ftp://anonymous@java.apache.org/java/jserv/dist/dll/>
