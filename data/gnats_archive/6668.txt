Linux keemanaan 2.3.9 #3 SMP Sat Aug 26 18:11:04 BST 2000 i686 unknown

>Description:
Customers are complaining of broken / not loaded images and "Connection Reset By Server" errors in IE4/IE5/NS4.x.  We thought this was a routing problem from our upstream, however, we have narrowed it down to one server.

Problem occurs on the index page but if the client refreshes the page several times the images all load correctly and susbsequent pages also load correctly.

We initially suspected possible disk failure, disks were replaced, data integrity was checked, network card replaced in server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Following URL's all generate this problem.

http://www.nathantraining.co.uk
http://www.flahoo.co.uk
http://www.furfab.com
http://www.pet-bed.co.uk

These are example sites, it happens on many more.

None of the data for these sites are in the same region on the disk.
