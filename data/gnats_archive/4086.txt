Linux tasmania 2.0.34 #2 Wed Oct 7 14:36:53 CEST 1998 i686 unknown
>Description:
In the previous apache server 1.3.1 i get the folowing error message on a 
not know host, and it was clear for the user view.
--------------------------------
Proxy Error

The proxy server could not handle the request GET http://www.bla.nl/.

Reason: Host not found Proxy Error
-------------------------------------------
On the server 1.3.4 i get the next error message, and people are calling me
if the site is down.
--------------------------------------------
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, Fred.Krom@ict.nl and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that
may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.
--------------------------------------------
I think it is simple but dit not find my way in the source.
Greatings Fred Krom.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try a not know site with both proxy server versions.
>Fix:
The error now is not clear, and people are confused.
