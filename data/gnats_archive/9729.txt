>Description:
Your debugging guide (http://httpd.apache.org/dev/debugging.html) 
suggests adding the -g flag with EXTRA_CFLAGS . 

However at the toplevel dir (ie: apache_1.3.23) doing the command: 

% make EXTRA_CFLAGS=" -g"

Causes the build under src/main to not use apaci and possibly use the 
wrong HTTPD_ROOT path. This is because src/main/Makefile has the line: 

EXTRA_CFLAGS =`$(SRCDIR)/apaci`

Hence (properly) adding a debug flag is not quite as simple as the 
debugging doc suggests.


>How-To-Repeat:


cd apache_1.3.23
./configure --prefix=/usr/foobar
make EXTRA_CFLAGS=" -g" 
./src/httpd -V 

<observe how the prefix didn't make it into the linked server binary> 
>Fix:

The documentation should probably be either updated to say: 

"Add the -g flag to EXTRA_CFLAGS in  apache_1.3.23/src/Configuration *before*
running apache_1.3.23/configure , to ensure all Makefiles are generated properly. " 

And/Or do *not* use EXTRA_CFLAGS internally and instead set apaci in another internal makefile variable. Reserving the EXTRA_* variable defines for user customization.

I would really suggest doing both, because there will be users like me that
may assume it's safe to redefine the EXTRA_*  variables on the fly. 


[And... Thankyou for all your efforts!]

State-Changed-Why:

Actually, if you are using apaci, I believe the INSTALL
file tells you the correct way to do it:

CFLAGS="-g" ./configure ...
make

Of course, I agree this is not too well documented.
But things are changing completely in 2.0 to an 
autoconf based system.  I hope that will be more
consistent with user expectations.

Thanks for using Apache!
