>Description:
1.3.23 

when browsing my open directory, in which there was a file named 'header.php' the file was invisible. when renamed 'foo_header.php' it was ok. when renamed 'header.php/txt' it was shown as php source code at the top of the directory listing page.
>How-To-Repeat:
using 1.3.23 on a windows 2000 professional box with php 4.1.1, simply browse an open directory wherein resides 2 files: header.php and header.php.txt - you will see the source code (header.php.txt) at the top, and u will NOT see header.php in the listing.
