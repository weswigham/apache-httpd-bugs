State-Changed-Why:
Did you recompile Apache after upgrading your OS?

If not, try it.

If so, then I don't think there is much we can suggest
other than that you contact your OS vendor for help.  It
doesn't look to be a problem with Apache, although it could
be.

I hate vendors that break stupid things.
