gcc version 2.7.2.1

>Description:
Password Files that are not in the format of:

  userid:password

are not parsed correctly.

This:

  userid:password:7100:100:Staranet Admin:/:ftp;mail

returns a password of:

  password:7100:100:Staranet Admin:/:ftp;mail

Anything after the first ":" is considered to be the Password.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use your /etc/passwd file for authentication or any password file that contains extra information after the password field.


>Fix:
authenticate_basic_user() function in mod_auth.c:

   Just before:

   /* anyone know where the prototype for crypt is? */

   if (strcmp(real_pw,(char *)crypt(sent_pw,real_pw)))


   Add:

   {
   char *real_pwptr = real_pw;

   while (*real_pwptr)
      {
      if (*real_pwptr == ':')
         {
         *real_pwptr = 0;
         break;
         }

      ++real_pwptr;
      }
   }

State-Changed-Why:
What part of "check to be sure the bug is in the current version"
don't you understand?

It is not a bug, since the htpasswd file was defined to be
user:passwd, with no mention of any other :s in there or
allowing any other data.  This was changed in 1.3a1 to allow
for extra : seperated info at the end.

Please, it is a waste of everyone's time if you don't follow
instructions and insist on submitting bug reports for year
old programs.

 As you can see in the manual page; .../docs/mod/mod_auth.html password
 files for 1.2.6 are to be in the above format.
 
 Some later versions of apache accomodate the 'passwd(8)' format.
