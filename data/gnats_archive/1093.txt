Happens in connection with some PCs and Macs and Netscape Navigator (to my 
knowledge not with Communicator), and there only sometimes (don't you love it?)
>Description:
I frequently have entries like this in my error-log:
[Wed Sep  3 09:51:32 1997] access to /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/lecture.pl 
                           failed for c1holmes-mac-16.cl.msu.edu, 
                           reason: POST or PUT without Content-length:
[Wed Sep  3 09:51:32 1997] request lost connection to client 
                           c1holmes-mac-16.cl.msu.edu
After submission, the user gets a "Waiting for reply", but no answer. I really 
need some help, I am not a UNIX-geek and feel kind of lost. THANK YOU!

State-Changed-When: Wed Sep  3 13:41:21 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:

I tested with Netscape4 and Lynx... no problem.
It looks like a client problem not an Apache problem.
You may want to try upgrading to a current version of Apache (your are using 1.1.1).

P.S.: Please give a correct release version if you issue a new bug report. Thanks.
