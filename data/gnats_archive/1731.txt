Linux secundus 2.0.30 #8 Mon Oct 6 15:14:50 CDT 1997 i586 unknown
gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
The docs for mod_include sez: "cmd -- The server will execute the given string using /bin/sh. The include variables are available to the command. "

But if arguments are given it fails with a 'cannot stat program' in the cgi log;
without args, it works o.k. (At least this is true in a suexec environment.)

The workaround is to package what would be arguments into a script without args
and call the arg-less script through the SSI.
>How-To-Repeat:
Working:  http://www.themarquis.com/index.shtml

Failing:  http://www.themarquis.com/showbug.shtml

These are identical except that the working one execs a script that contains
what the failing one calls directly via 'exec cmd=...'.
>Fix:
suexec.c does not parse the cmd at all.  It passes the whole command string
to lstat.  Instead, pass everything up to the first whitespace character to lstat, not the whole string

State-Changed-Why:
Good point.  This bug has been previously reported, it's
bug number 1120, and a fix may appear after 1.3.0 is out.
For the time being a patch exists - check out
