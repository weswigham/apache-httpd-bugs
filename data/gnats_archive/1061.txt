built on NetBSD 1.2D, running on another NetBSD 1.2D system. Both are i386 architecture.
NetBSD lox.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca 1.2D NetBSD 1.2D (LOX) #5: Sun Jun 15 18:40:19 EDT 1997     mcr@istari.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca:/j/netbsd/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/LOX i386
>Description:
Cannot open scoreboard file:
/ox/etc/httpd/logs/apache_runtime_status: Permission denied

I run as a user "loxwww". I had to make /ox/etc/httpd/logs a+rw, and touch and chmod loxwww the apache_runtime_status file
to get Apache to startup correct. I would have expected that just a+rw would do the trick, and then the file
would be created with an appropriate user, and then I could chmod to the right user (i'd have thought it
was either root or loxhttp). Yes, I am starting it was root.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I'd like to know if I can enable HAVE_MMAP on NetBSD. I think I ought to be able to.
I'm happy to try any patches. Meanwhile, I'll try HAVE_MMAP and then just back out to my
working version

To try HAVE_MMAP just add -DHAVE_MMAP to your EXTRA_CFLAGS and reconfigure/rebuild.

The scoreboard file should be created as root when it's booted...
you shouldn't have to create it or anything.  Is that maybe an
NFS mounted partition?  If so then you definately want to use
the ScoreboardFile directive and move it somewhere non-NFS.

   Hmm. Okay. What modes should the directory be?

   Not NFS. No NFS at all on this system since it is exposed.
 
   I tried MMAP, and that seemed to solve the problem. But, perhaps
 there are some issues here on systems that won't use MMAP.

At some point we documented the permissions needed for the
directory with the scoreboard.  See:

Thanks for using Apache!
