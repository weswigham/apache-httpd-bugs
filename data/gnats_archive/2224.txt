>Description:
We're trying to use DBM User Authentication resource, but when we run the
perl program "dbmmanage", we receive the message "No dbm on this machine
at dbmmanage, line 94". This line refer to a call to the function dbmopen.

State-Changed-When: Wed May 13 08:01:09 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is an error from perl saying that you don't have DBM
support compiled into perl.  You need to recompile your
perl to include DBM support, presuming your machine has
the necessary libraries.
