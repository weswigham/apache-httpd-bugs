Subject:        Question

Hello,

I know that you are not the manufacture or support provider for
installation packages created with your software.  I am also not the
builder of this installation.

However I am trying to install Apache's JServ module (
http://java.apache.org/jserv/dist/Apache_JServ_1.0b1.exe ) and the
hangup looks like it might be something on your end.  During the final
phases of the installation after the files are copied, the installer
attempts to locate the java runtime files.  It does a search on the hard
drive.  You have the option of clicking cancel (or waiting for the
search to complete) at which time you can select the file yourself if it
has not been found.  The text says "Setup could not locate the Java
runtime interpreter %java_exe%.  Please indicate the path where it is
located."  From my experience %java_exe% looks like a environment
variable.  However no matter where I define %java_exe% it doesn't work.
I've tried it on two machines so far (NT 4.0 SP4, NT 4.0 SP3).  I have
been defining java_exe in the system and user areas under Control
Panel|System|Environment.  I have rebooted numerous times and installed
various different JDK's/JRE's.

In addition there is no way to break out of the installation once it
gets to the searching point.  If I click cancel it wants me to select
the file myself...If it doesn't find the file in the path specified, it
starts searching again, looping over and over.

If you feel this is a problem with the Apache JServ installation, I will
talk to them.

Thanks
-Noah

I would suggest checking with the makers of the Apache J Serv ,module.

You can download Installer VISE - at www.mindvision.com.

You are correct that %java_exe% looks like an environment variable. It is
however a variable internal to the installer. You can not specify the value
of %java_exe% through the registry or the Autoexec.bat.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Possibly allow the user to select the java executable directly because it could be java.exe or jre.exe

 Category changed to mod_jserv (not sure if this will make it there but
 subject is unchanged as requested).

 Noah,
 
 %java_exe% is not a system variable in this context, it's a variable
 Apache
 has set up to use inside the installer. I'm guessing it is supposed to
 be
 replaced with the file name of the Java runtime interpreter but isn't
 for
 some reason. The installer is probably looking for the Java runtime
 interpreter and can't find it.
 
 In any case, you'll need to get a hold of someone at Apache and ask them
 what the installer is looking for at that point. I tried the installer
 on
 my machine and had the same problems you are experiencing. I think there
 may be something wrong with the way the Apache JServ installer was
 setup.
 
 I've forwarded your message to the contact we have with the Apache
 project
 and I'm sure he will get in touch with you.
 
 Regards,

 Hi Spencer,
 
 I found that you just have to let the installer search.  Even if you
 point it to the file it will not find it.  Just make sure that java.exe
 or jre.exe exists somewhere.  I didn't want to let it run completely
 because I have a huge hard drive thats packed.  But it searches about 2
 or 3 times.  Each time for something different.  Let it run to
 completion and see what happens.  I'm ccing apache so this information
 will be appended.  Also make sure you download the JServ b3 jar file or
 it won't work.  I still have yet to make it work even though its
 installed.

 resolved.  This particular bug is no longer a bug.  Its just a funky
 installer :)

That is then used as an install location.

I cannot help you because -

I don't  know if the files that are installed based off of the find are
needed (there may be other events that are triggered based on the success or
failure of the find action).


Thanks for your response and let me know if I can help in any other way.
