Linux 2.0.33 alpha unknown
>Description:
in src/regex/README there's a hint to "make r" in order to test the regexp
suite. this make fails with: 

debug.o: In function `regchar':
debug.o(.text+0x994): undefined reference to `ap_isprint'
>How-To-Repeat:
tar xzf apache_1.3.6.tgz; cd apache_1.3.6; ./configure; make; cd src/regex; make r
>Fix:
if you change ap_isprint to ap_snprintf in line 237 of debug.c, it compiles,
and the tests on my linux/i386 pass, on linux/alpha they fail though.

State-Changed-By: rse
State-Changed-When: Tue Jun 29 07:12:16 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Replacing ap_isprint with with ap_sprintf isn't quite correct.
We've fixed the "make r" for Apache 1.3.6 by including
the header file which defines the macro ap_isprint.
Nevertheless thanks for the hint and your feedback.
