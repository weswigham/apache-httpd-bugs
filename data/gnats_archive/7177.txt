Windows NT4, using the MSI installer for Apache1.3.17 that's just gone online in the binaries/win32 directory.
>Description:
Binary install package for Apache 1.3.17 for Win32 contains Unix httpd.conf and modules directory contains only ".so" modules (".dll" files are missing).

Other related problem: when installing Apache 1.3.17 on Win32, on top of an existing httpd.conf file (note: the previous Apache program *was* uninstalled before attempting to install the new version), references to built-in DLL-based modules caused the server startup and service installation to fail (as there were only "so" modules and no "dlls" - see above).  Thereafter, it was possible to start Apache from the MSDOS command-line (once I'd edited out the "LoadModule" lines), but couldn't install service from the command line or from the icons in the start menu (the icons available with Apache 1.3.14 were much more logical than those under 1.3.17 in my opinion...).

Once this problem has been resolved, could you state on the download page for Win32 binaries that this problem has been addressed in order to avoid needing to keep downloading and reinstalling Apache to see if it's been updated?

Many thanks for an otherwise great piece of software!

>How-To-Repeat:
Try installing on Windows NT.  You'll also experience problems if an existing httpd.conf exists and uses some modules (such as mod_expires and mod_header, which was what I had in my httpd.conf)
>Fix:
Probably rebuild the installer...

State-Changed-Why:

The install package was correct (the bundled .so files) and
the httpd.default.conf and httpd.conf files are win32.

See the mod_so.html documentation.

On your other point, clearing away the existing .conf file,
we do -not- simply overwrite it, since many users already
have customizations.  We will consider your request to
back up the existing httpd.conf and replace it when the
user is prompted and agrees.

So this is relegated to an installer change-request someone
will look at when/if they have time

Thanks for using apache.
