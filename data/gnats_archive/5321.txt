 Hi!

 When I had a scriptalias defined for a directory everything worked OK delivering 
2 types of pages (HTML and WML) w/o problems.
 Unfortunately since the local NIC gave us a domain, I can't reproduce the problem: that is,
I can't have a scriptalias for the root of the new domain. The only kludge I
found was using .cgi outside the cgi-bin directory and define index.cgi as the default homepage.
 Not very secure :-|

 best regards,

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a VirtualHost and try to make a scriptalias for the homepage
>Fix:
Yes:
1) enhance the ScriptAlias processing so the domain is analyZed (that is, instead of /cgi-bin/, permit also virtualdomain.com/cgi-bin
2) define a new virtualhost directive to define the homepage as a .cg

You really need to be specific about details.  We can't
read minds.  Things like "latest" version of Apache have
little meaning.

You need to say exactly what directives you tried in your
config file and exactly what happened when you tried
to use it that made you think it wasn't working properly.

It may be obvious to you, but we have no idea what you are
doing unless you tell us...

 What is wrong with "ScriptAlias / /path/to/cgi" in the appropriate
 VirtualHost section?
 
 Note that, as the docs clearly describe, scriptalias takes a url path and
 maps it to a filesystem path.  So unless your filesystem has a "/cgi-bin"
 directory, what you say you used can't work.

  Nothing at all. It's not not (well enough) documented :-) That should do
 the trick. Thanks!

  It has.
