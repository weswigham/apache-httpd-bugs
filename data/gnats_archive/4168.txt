OSF1 saturn V4.0 1091 alpha alpha
i.e Tru64 Unix V4.0E
native cc compiler (DEC C V5.8-009 on Digital UNIX V4.0 (Rev. 1091))
(also tried with GNU gcc 2.8.1 - same result)
>Description:
After doing './configure', 'make' and 'make install' (the latter
as root) and executing '/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start'
(also as root), 'lynx http://localhost/' does not work (with
the default data files and config file).
I get:
Alert!: Unexpected network read error; connection aborted.
Alert!: Unable to access document.
lynx: Can't access startfile http://localhost/
(lynx version 2.8.1)

With netscape 3.04 I get:
No document

The error log looks like:
