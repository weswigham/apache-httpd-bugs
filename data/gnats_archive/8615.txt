SUSE 7.2
linux 2.4.4.64gb-smp
>Description:
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111>
        ServerAdmin luis@pobox.com
        ServerName avalon-folk.com
        ServerAlias *.avalon-folk.com
        DocumentRoot /home/www/avalon
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111>
        ServerAdmin luis@pobox.com
        ServerName busco-novia.com
        ServerAlias *.busco-novia.com
        DocumentRoot /home/www/novios
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111>
        ServerAdmin luis@pobox.com
        ServerName busco-novio.com
        ServerAlias *.busco-novio.com
        DocumentRoot /home/www/novios
</VirtualHost>

When I write http://busco-novia.com goto to the default virtual page not to the correct page....

>How-To-Repeat:
http://busco-novio.com
http://busco-novia.com   --> go to default web virtual (see in the title "wellcome to busco-novia.com)
http://kk.busco-novia.com   --> go to the correct site (see in the title "NOVIETES")

>Fix:
Perhaps is a mistake because
1.-the hyphen
2.-the domainnames are 99% equal, only 1 letter is different.

State-Changed-Why:
The SuSE version of linux has a bunch of crappy modules
added to the distribution.  They tend to mess things
up.  In this particular case, you can probably fix your
problem by getting rid of mod_dyn_vhost, but in general,
I suggest you get rid of the apache distributed by
SuSE and get a version from httpd.apache.org.

Thanks for using Apache!
