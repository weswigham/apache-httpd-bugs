Win95 
>Description:
I installed 1.3.17 in a win95 machine.
I couldn't install from apache_1.3.19-win32-no_src-r2.msi as it told me I had another version installed. I did try de-installing the current version to no avail.
I then downloaded apache_1.3.19-win32-src-r2.msi and that appeared to install/upgrade my system. However my modules directory is populated by .so files instead of .dll files.

State-Changed-Why:

The .so files are correct.  Only the names have changed,
the files are still the same.

Thanks for using Apache!
