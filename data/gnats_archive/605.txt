SunOS tank 5.5 Generic sun4m
>Description:
I RTFM, and UTFM (understand) and do the do per instructed.
I then kill off all of my httpd processes and
restart using new binary.  my logfiles report this:
[date/time/year] socket: Protocol not supported
[date/time/year] - Failed to get a socket, exiting child

the only solution from the obvious is that for some reason
apache will not let got of the port even after i've killed it.
though upon testing it on a higher port i still receive the 
same error... so maybe not.  

>How-To-Repeat:
i'd be glad to mail a copy of my source though its barley modified
>Fix:
no, i am reporting it in hopes that you have a solution.

State-Changed-Why:
Did this behavior persist after you reboot the server?

Did you kill the old server properly, ie. by sending a 
-TERM to the parent (and only the parent) process?

Were there any Apache processes still hanging around?
