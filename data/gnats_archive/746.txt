>Description:
I am trying to set up a virtual host on my machine.  I have things configured
to be like:

server name		user	group
www.flame.org		www	nobody
www.sorcery.net		sorcery	sor-www

However, the server cannot access, as www.sorcery.net, files which are
mode 640 and user:group explorer:sor-www.  However, they work fine when
the mode is 644.  This makes the .htaccess directive meaningless, as
anyone on my machine as full access to the files.
>How-To-Repeat:
Contact me for more information if you need it.

Simple case should be:

set up main host, user foo, group bar.
set up virtual host, user baz, group bax.

Make a file owned by baz:bax in the virtual's space, mode 640.
Try to read it.  It will fail.  chmod 644 it, and it will work.

Make a file owned by foo:bar in the virtual space, mode 640.  Try to read
it.  It will work.
>Fix:
No idea.  I think the virtual host code needs a roto-till.  At the very least,
the child servers need to be more virtual-host aware, and perhaps even running
as a specific user:group and maintained on seperate child pools.

It seems that you could maintain a user:group pool for each configured
user:group defined, and use the appropriate pool for the requests to
the servers.

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug.  Either Apache has to run as root
to be able to switch UIDs (which we aren't willing to
do at this point) or you have to run seperate copies of
Apache with different directives.  suexec can help for CGIs...
