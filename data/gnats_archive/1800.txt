>Description:
If you have a parsed HTML file with exec-cgi and the CGI to run has
parameter, Apache will fails to run it (without parameter everything is fine),
apache 1.2.5 on linux (and Netscape Commerce server on solaris) work fine 
with the same file.
Here is the message in the logs:
[Fri Feb 13 11:28:49 1998] [error] invalid CGI ref "/cgi-bin/counter.pl?countname=forillon_fr" in d:/home/http/forillon_fr/index.htm
>How-To-Repeat:
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/counter.pl?countname=forillon_fr"-->
Or any CGI that requires a parameter. If no parameters, everything will work
fine.
>Fix:
Probably that Apache forgot to split at the "?" to separate arguments from 
program

State-Changed-Why:
As the mod_include docs clearly say if you read them,
this is not supposed to work by design.

If you want to do this, using include virtual instead of
exec cgi.  exec cgi is defined as working as the way it
is documented to work, and changing that would break existing
implementations.
