>Description:
I was having trouble configuring server-side includes, so I searched the docs.
I searched the Apache 1.3 docs, and came up with some pages.  I started reading
them, and found things that didn't make sense.  It turned out that I was being
given docs for version 2.0 when I had searched the version 1.3 documentation.

Looking again, I notice from the URLs that numerous hits for version 2.0 docs
were returned by the search.

This isn't so bad under normal circumstances, but when there is a fire to put
out it can be problematic....
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to:  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/  Note that the page says "Apache HTTP
Server Version 1.3"

enter the search string "server side includes" and search

Notice that several of the top search results contain version 2.0 documentation.
>Fix:
segregate the docs for version 1.3 and version 2.0
