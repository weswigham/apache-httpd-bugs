>Description:
It seems that Apache HTTP Server works in a strange way when the configuration file contains both a Listen and a Port directive together with at least one virtual host. In this particular case Apache configures the virtual host with apparently wrong settings.

In particular starting Apache with the following (fragment) configuration

Port 80
Listen 90

<VirtualHost 123.45.678.9>
	ServerName name1
</VirtualHost>

it will start the Apache server (without producing any error/warning message) but the "main server" and not the virtual host (?!) will listen on address "123.45.678.9:90"... Moreover, running "Apache.exe -S" it shows
the following virtual host (?!)

123.45.678.9:80       name1 (d:/apache/conf/httpd.conf:1027)

All this is very strange! The main server had to be disabled and only the
virtual host "name1" had to listen on address 123.45.678.9:90 

Looking at the Apache documentation you can find the following considerations: 

1) In no event does a Port setting affect what ports a VirtualHost responds on, the VirtualHost directive itself is used for that.

2) In the absence of any Listen (or BindAddress) directives specifying a port number, a Port directive given in the "main server" (i.e., outside any 
<VirtualHost> section) sets the network port on which the server listens. If there are any Listen (or BindAddress) directives specifying :number then Port has no effect on what address the server listens at.

So it seems that there is something wrong.

>How-To-Repeat:
It is only necessary to run Apache with a configuration file that specifies
at least one Listen, a Port and at least one VirtualHost section.

Comment-Added:

It appears that this is a documentation conflict between
the Port docs and the VirtualHost docs.  If you look at
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#virtualhost
you will see that it states that, in the absence of an
explict port in the <VirtualHost> directive, the
most recently specified Port directive is used.

Your particular problem is easily solved by tacking
:90 or :* to the end of the IP address in the
<VirtualHost> block.
