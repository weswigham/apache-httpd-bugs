Hi all apache users ,
  I have servlet application which it is purpose to upload file to our server 
directory. I have tested with text files , it upload the files successfully.
However when i tried to upload the binary files, it cannot upload the files, 
in the tomcat , it will display "Y" in Unix terminal.
And the browser will prompt "page cannot be displayed error"..
Anyone have any ideas why ? It this is the bugs in Apache or in my application ?

Thanks weetat
