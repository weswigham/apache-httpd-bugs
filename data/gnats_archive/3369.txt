Windows 95 4.00.950, Apache Win32 1.3.3 binary distribution
>Description:
I realize that the software is free so I can't complain.  What I am 
hoping for is a few corrections to the documentation to make 
installation and operation a little easier for non-experts like me.
I was able to find help in the newsgroup you suggested so the program is
working fine.  This is just a request that you update the instructions 
that come with the Win32 distribution.  Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your report. We are aware that the documentation
is not as clear as it could be. This applies also to
the standard Unix version, but is particularly applicable
to Windows (and OS/2) ports. Some changes have been committed to make it clearer when statements apply only
to Unix, and provide some Windows and OS/2 information where
required, in addition to the Unix default.
