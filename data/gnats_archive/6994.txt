>Description:
when the Apache is started, I expected that one parent Apache process with  one child starts up. But after some time another parent apache with it's child is 
getting spwaned overwritting the PidFile (httpd.pid). When I kill the Apache,
programmatically, ( using -k shutdown option ) , only that apache process and its child process is getting killed whose pid entry is there in the httpd.pid and hence another apache and its child is hanging out there.
sorry for introduncing Win API , but even if I call  DestroyWindow() from my application, the additional apache is not getting killed ( pl note I can't do TerminateProcess on the pid of additional apache, because there is no way of finding it in Win95 ). 
Pl give the solution to this problem , if u can....
Would'nt it be good if apache was built with some kind of mutex, so that only one instance of apache is running.

State-Changed-Why:

First, Apache 1.3.6 is horribly dated, please use a more
recent version.

Second, multiple instances of Apache -are- allowed to run
(think in terms of four servers running under different
user accounts with different permissions.)  If you are
trying to kill the Apache NT service, use the SCM.  If you
are trying to kill the Apache 9x service, look at the
service.c code in apache for how apache stops itself.  And
if you are trying to kill console apache, wait for 1.3.15
and post a WM_CLOSE (actually, works in 1.3.14 on NT, but
not under 9x.)

Good luck
