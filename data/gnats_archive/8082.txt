The output:File not found
>Description:
I have a web site.  This site has a homepage. The home page consists of a left frame which includes a list of Items' links and a ritht frame to display the screen after the user clicks on its link in the left frame.
The programs that generate the screens are CGI scripts.
The problem is when I click on the link in the left frame, I find a message to tell me that the page not found.  When I checked in log errors, I found error message to tell me that the file doesn't exist although the path is Ok and the program doesn't have any error and it generate the screen in the PerlBuilder.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
