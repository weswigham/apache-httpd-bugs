>Description:
With a server setup to handle a large number of <Virtual Host>'s, it's possible
that if one virtual server gets exceptionally busy (e.g. is suffering heavy
load, or a Denial of Service attack) - it's repeated requests can stop other
Virtual Servers from being serviced (rather obvious really). This is bad, and
probably likely to get worse as more people swicth to name-based virtual servers,
and stack more servers up per 'httpd instance'.
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a server with say 50 Virtual Host's, then launch rapid and repeated
requests to just one of these virtual hosts, the others obviously end up 'starved'
of httpd resources. The problem can be made worse if the requests to the popular
server are to fetch a large image / download etc.
>Fix:
Perhaps add something like the ability to set a 'MaxClients' option, which can
be set on a per-virtual server basis? So that no one virtual server can consume
all the available 'MaxClients' of the root httpd process? Maybe even make it a
'percentage' setting?
