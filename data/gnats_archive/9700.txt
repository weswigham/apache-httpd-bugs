>Description:
I have a isapi dll created with Delphi 6 that generates a chart and streams it the browser. It works fine under OmniHTTPD and IIS5 but seems to hang a apache process. The process will use all leftover cpu time resulting in 100% cpu usage under task manager. I can run isapi dlls fine if they return text but it breaks when returning images. So far I've only tried to return jpegs.

Under 1.3.23 it hangs a single apache process.
Under 2.0.28 it shows the image for the first request then hangs a single process.
>How-To-Repeat:
This is the code to handle the /GetChart action on the dll.

var
  MemStr : TMemoryStream;
begin
  MemStr := GenerateChart;
  MemStr.Position := 0;
  Response.CustomHeaders.Add('Content-Disposition=; ' + 'filename="chart.jpg"');
  Response.ContentType := 'image/jpeg';
  Response.ContentLength := MemStr.Size;
  Response.ContentStream := MemStr;
  Response.SendResponse;
end;

I have tried a few different variations of this.

Original: //works under IIS5 and omniHTTPd
  Response.ContentType := 'image/jpeg';
  Response.ContentStream := GenerateChart;
  Response.SendResponse;
