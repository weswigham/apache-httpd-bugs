>Release:        1.3.22
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Server sp 5
>Description:
We have Apache Web Server ver. 1.3.22 and Trend Micro for virus scanning running on a Windows NT 4.0 server. We get a Proxy Error for some websites and another we do not see the images on. When Apache is OFF and Trend Micro (for scanning) is OFF, we we can get to these pages without a problem. When Apache is ON and Trend is OFF we cannont get to these sites. When Trend and Apache are ON we cannot get to these sites. This leads us to believe it is a problem with Apache. Please see the list of websites below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here are the example URLs:
www.powermarketers.com (on the left of the screen under Breaking News: we are able to get to Reuters, but CANNOT get to International, National, or KRT, when Apache is turned on).
http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-retrieve.html#page1
https://www.iisonline.statestreet.com/ (You would need a logon ID and password to logon to the site, which I cannot provide...this is the site who's images do not appear)
