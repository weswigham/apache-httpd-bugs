Apache binary used - also running InstantASP
Only chaned the config files enough to get it to work

>Description:
Maybe Im stupid( well actually I am) but Im running Apache on a local server to develop web pages. When I change the source of the files and then try to reload them with my browser pointing at the server I never get the updated file. Then about a day later it realises that the files changed and I might get the new one.
Sorry if Im really dumb but I have searched the whole of your web site and Im stuck.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Is it something to do with cacheing somewhere? Ive cleared them on my client machine.
