>Description:
In the ".htaccess" file, if one is trying to set up passwords, and
spells "Require" incorrectly (ie. "Requite"), instead of ignoring
the command, the server crashes before passing control to
a CGI that is protected by this.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just spell "Require" wrong. That ought to do it.
>Fix:
Ignore typos :-%2

The "latest Apache" means nothing.

A 500 server error is not a "crash", it is telling the
client that the server is incorrectly configured so it
can't serve requests.  That is the way it is supposed to
work.  If you have something unparsable in the .htaccess
file, it is better to deny access then to permit access
because you could be permitting unwanted access.  The
error is logged in the error log; it is documented quite
clearly that you should look in the error log for errors.
