>Description:
My system crashed.
On reboot, httpd does not restart, because it checks for httpd.pid in bin/logs/.
This exists, because httpd was not shut down properly, so the system thinks
httpd is already running.
>How-To-Repeat:
Kill httpd, and if httpd.pid doesn't exist, make one up. To be thorough, enter a PID which is currently in use, and can be killed without consequence.
Reboot, or run apachectl with an appropriate commandline parameter.
>Fix:
It should be safe to delete this file on boot.
So enter the following line in apachectl at the appropriate place:
if [ -f $PIDFILE ] rm $PIDFILE
the appropriate place being at least the vicinity of "case start)"
and possibly "restart)" and graceful)"
