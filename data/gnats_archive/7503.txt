>Originator:     dave@convio.com
>Release:        1.3.x
>Organization:
>Environment:
Not system specific - tested on Linux 2.2.12 (Red Hat 6.1) and FreeBSD
4.0_RELEASE, both with gcc
>Description:
The result of a RedirectMatch directive is urlencoded before returning it
to the browser. This behaviour is inconsistent with Redirect, and is contrary
to the more common use case and most users expectations.

A more complete fix would also add a flag to these directives which would dump
the inbound querystring. I will colunteer to write this if you would like to
include it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the following in httpd.conf

RedirectMatch 301 /foo.html /cgi-bin/page.pl?page=foo
Redirect 301 /bar.html /cgi-bin/page.pl?page=bar

and then try the URLs

http://<server>:<port>/foo.html
http://<server>:<port>/bar.html

The former redirects to

http://<server>:<port>/cgi-bin/page.pl%3fpage=foo

which is not the common use case.

See also GNATS entries 3333, 4379, 5948 which this patch also fixes

>Fix:
The following diff works against (at least) 1.3.12 through 1.3.19...

State-Changed-Why:
We can't just remove the escaping, because it is possible
to redirect to a file with a space in it.  If we don't
escape the URI, then we will redirect to an invalid URL.
The problem is that we are escaping too much.  Currently we escape the URI and the QUERY_STRING.

I am attaching a patch that solves this problem, while maintaining the ability to redirect to a URL with spaces.  This patch is against 2.0, but it should also apply to 1.3.  Please test this and let me know if it works for you.

Comment-Added:
In changing the rest of the PRs about this bug, I realized 
that this patch doesn't solve all of the problem.  So, here
is a new patch that solves the remaining problem with this 
patch.
