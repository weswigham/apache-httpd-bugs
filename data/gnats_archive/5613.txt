State-Changed-Why:
This is a configuration problem with your local compiler installation.

If you have trouble getting the node license configured, please contact the appropriate IBM support organization.

(Hint: in the simplest license scenario you simply copy a line from the license file that came with the compiler to /var/ifor/nodelock.  But please don't ask me questions because I don't know much about this :)  That's what the compiler support people are for.)

Thanks for using Apache...
