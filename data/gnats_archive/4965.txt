No core dump, sorry. 
I previously had Apache 1.3.4 set up on my computer using JServ and it worked fine.
After a total reinstall, I decided to reinstall 1.3.9 cleanly. Since the registry 
was clean, I removed the apache1.3.4 directory and installed 1.3.9.
I then also installed JServ, and proceeded to test it out. It didn't work, so I
then reverted to the default "httpd.conf"
That worked (because server-parsed is disabled there).
After trying various permutations, I found out that I could get the server to work 
by just commenting the 'server-parsed' line out.

My index file is a .shtml file using SSI's include and exec, but it's something 
internal to apache, because the server doesn't even log a connection or an error.
>How-To-Repeat:
This should work:
install Apache 1.3.9 in Win98
enable the following in the conf file.
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

Start Apache up using "Apache.exe"
try to access any page. It should stall at "waiting for reply" 
(status bar in Netscape Nav. 4.61)

I'm reinstalling 1.3.4, so I can't give an URL.

>Fix:
I don't know what's changed since 1.3.4, but it worked fine for me then.
If you'd like to see the conf file it failed on or the conf file I used 
with 1.3.4, please email me at :
