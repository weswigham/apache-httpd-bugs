>Description:
Please see the telnet output below. The answer is 206 instead of 200. Apache could send the full document. But it does not send the last byte of the document.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sat Apr 28 10:14:31 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Bytes are numbered starting with 0, so 0 through 19277
is the entire document.

While Apache _could_ ignore the byte range request if it is for the entire document and just return the whole thing with a 200 status, it doesn't, but insteads sends a perfectly legitimate 206 response, for a couple of reasons.
