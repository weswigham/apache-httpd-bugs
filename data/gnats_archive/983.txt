>Description:
I'm running a set of PHP scripts that run fine on older sites, but when run on a brand new install of a recent Apache install (both 1.2.0 and today, 1.3a1), the scripts fail - passing through the error message 

"Unsupported content-type: multipart/form-data"



This is a two-part failure in that the HTTP 1.1 spec. requires that unrecognized multipart subtypes be treated as multipart/mixed.
>How-To-Repeat:
try http://ne-arts.net/php/files/files.phtml, select any file for uploading, and push the button - other things will fail since the script isn't fully installed, but the error message will be generated as the first result of executing the form post 
>Fix:
figure out why this stopped working from earlier version

State-Changed-Why:
This is not an Apache issue.  Apache is not responsible
for dealing with that at all.  The error message you
refer to comes from PHP (post.c).  My guess would
be that you did not configure PHP to allow for file
upload support (config time question), but that is something
you have to take up with whatever support channels
exist for PHP.
