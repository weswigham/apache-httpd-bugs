Guessing that perhaps oolympus.net is supposed to be olympus.net.  If you
are getting this and didn't submit the PR, ignore it.

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at hyperreal.org.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<ned@oolympus.net>:
Sorry, I couldn't find any host named oolympus.net. (#5.1.2)

Synopsis: Problem with configuration file

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Feb 25 14:00:23 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Multi-word AuthName settings now have to be enclosed
in double quotes (eg. AuthName "foo bar").

This probably isn't made clear enough in the CHANGES file.
