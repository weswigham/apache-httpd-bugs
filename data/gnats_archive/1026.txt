>Description:
Accessing URL http://example/~user/gif put this entry into error_log:

[Wed Aug 20 19:11:41 1997] access to /home/e/user/gif failed for 206.154.93.140, reason: Premature end of script headers

In the cgi directory is a .htaccess file:
ForceType application/x-httpd-cgi

Of course, there is nothing wrong with the CGI ;-)
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, reverted to old Apache.
>Fix:
No :-)
Let me know of progress, as there is pressure to upgrade to plug
perceived security hole

State-Changed-Why:
What do you mean "same as entry in CHANGES"?

What version are you upgrading from?  Were you using
suexec before?

What does the LOG_EXEC (as defined in suexec.h) say about
the attempt?

 Well, that would probably mean you didn't read the suexec.h file and look
 at the HTTPD_USER setting.  It must be the same as the user Apache runs as
 (ie. that which is set in the main User directive).
 
 Docs are always available at http://www.apache.org/
 
 In this case, check http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html

 If I'd done the upgrade myself, this problem wouldn't have arisen :-)
 
 Please close the ticket, and thankyou.
