Online browse of Apache Doc Project.
>Description:
MS-IE supposedly does not honor "Content-type" directives in http headers.
It will, however, honor "Content-Type" directives.  If it isn't given a (valid)
content type, then it will guess, using the first 255 characters of the stream.

The Apache server was corrected years ago (and the Netscape server as well),
because it used to output the mixed-case header.  Still, the Doc Project has
many examples of "bad" use of this header, which will lead to fledgling web
programmers making the same mistake.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is just a few of the offending pages:
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html
  http://perl.apache.org/dist/cgi_to_mod_perl.html
  PDF documentation sections:
    Apache Content Negotiation
    Custom Error Responses
    Apache 1.3 URL Rewriting Guide
    Apache Server FAQ
    Apache Tutorial: Dynamic Content with CGI
    The Apache TPF Port
    Apache module mod_asis
    Apache API notes
>Fix:
A simple recursive grep of the (doc) tree should be able to detect all
ocurrences of the mixed-case "bad" (ignored) directive.

>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Fri Feb  8 14:02:45 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

HTTP Response headers are case-insensitive according to
HTTP/1.1.  MSIE is know to ignore the content-type in
all kinds of situations, whenever it pleases.  I've
never heard of the particular problem that you 
specify.

Having said that, consistency in the documentation is
good, so it would be nice if we used the same casing.

Thanks for the suggestion.
