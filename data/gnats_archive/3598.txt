Doesn't seem so, since that table itself lives in the same
pool as the request rec.  That is, at least for
HSE_REQ_SEND_URL_REDIRECT_RESP...

On the other hand, HSE_REQ_SEND_URL uses the syntax:
        ap_internal_redirect((char*)lpvBuffer, r);	

This could be a problem, since the ISAPI .dll owns the
lpvBuffer... and although I've been able to repeat only
once (and couldn't catch it in the debugger), I'm committing
a fix to 1.3.13-dev so we ap_pstrdup the argument before
redirecting.

Hope it solves the problem
