>Description:
In my configuration for apache 1.2.4 I had an IP based configuration for
<Location /status> and <Location /server-info>. Using apache 1.3b2 I'm
getting an 'access denied by server configuration' trying to access
the status and server-info pages. By changing the line from
allow from 131.188.191.64
to
allow from aeria.phil.uni-erlangen.de
access to these pages will work again. The <Directory> directive still works
with IPs and: no, there are no comments in the same line.
>How-To-Repeat:
Send me an IP/FQDN pair from the client you use for testing and I could set up 
status IP based and server-info domain name based for this client.

No

State-Changed-Why:
I can't reproduce this, I tried this:

<Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    order deny,allow
    deny from all
    allow from 127.0.0.1
</Location>

and it worked no problem.  Is that similar to what you
have?  Can you try an allow 127.0.0.1 and access it
locally?

 Ok the bug looks to be in the address parsing for addresses without '/' in
 them.  It works fine if the address is 131.188.191.4/32 (which uses
 ap_inet_addr()).  It breaks if the address is 131.188.191.4.

 Just a cut'n'paste mistake. I checked both server-info and server-status
 to see if the problem is related to mod_info or mod_status.

 O.K., that could be the problem (see below). There's one patch 
 from hp affecting libinet I haven't installed yet. 
 But I've got no physical access to the web-server right now 
 (building is closed already) and I don't trust autoboot 
 enough to patch it remotely. So don't spend any time with 
 that problem until I patched the system tomorrow or the day 
 after. I'll mail you the results.
