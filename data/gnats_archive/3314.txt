State-Changed-Why:
Glad you are working on Apache Modules and contributing
back to the community, but if you could please add
your module to the Apache Module Registry rather than
opening a PR for it that would be great.  Here is the
URL for registering an Apache Module:
http://modules.apache.org/register
Thanks for using Apache.

Hi there at the Apache Team,

I'm not quite sure wether this is the right way to make contributions. I =
would like to contribute a module that provides LDAP based user =
authentication. It implements the following features:

* User authentication by trying a bind with the user's DN/password =
against an LDAP server
* User authentication by comparing password attributes (clear text, MD5, =
SHA, SHA1)
* Access control based on user (require valid-user or user), groups =
(require group) or based on attribute values (require attribute <name> =
<value> ...)
* The LDAP attributes used to store user id and user passwords are =
configurable

The module comes as a tar file containing the module's source, a patch =
file and a short documentation. To compile it, you need SSLeay 0.9.0b =
and the LDAP 3.3 SDK (University of Michigan). The module is available =
for Apache 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 (including SSL version) and tested on Linux =
2.0.33. Adaption to Apache 1.3.3 will be available soon.

Please let me know if you like to make this module part of the server or =
to make it public available as a separate module.
