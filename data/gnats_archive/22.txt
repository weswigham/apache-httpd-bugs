Here's what I got when compiling suexec

test:/root/larc/apache/apache_1.2b1/support# gcc suexec.c -o suexec
In file included from suexec.c:101:

State-Changed-Why:
Something looks to be messed up in your httpd.h.  In any
case, this PR is a bit stale by the time I got here so if
the problem still exists with the version in 1.2b5 when
released submit another report.
