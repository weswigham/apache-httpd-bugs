>Description:
TestCompile cd into the helpers directory, creates the Makefile, executes
make, but the Makefile changes directory back up to src.  Theres really no
reason to do this and it breaks make's default rule.

State-Changed-Why:
The script used to be the way you suggest, but it was
changed last year. TestCompile needs to link stuff in the
same location as the real compile to be reliable.

I don't understand quite what your problem was though. Are
you trying to configure and/or make Apache in a separate
directory from the source tree, or is there some other
uncommon thing you're trying to do?

 Looking at the PR, I can certainly understand your confusion.
 
 It was a QNX 4.24 problem.  QNX used a fairly old version of gmake (3.74 I
 think).
 
 After I wrote the PR, I found that it sometimes worked.  Yes, I mean
 sometimes.  It was odd.
 
 I honestly can't remember the details.  I think the object files and
 binaries were being created in the parent directory and thus the tests for
 them failed.  Sorry I didn't get around to annotating the PR.
 
 QNX also had a broken regexp implementation in sed which broke the top level
 configure script (I may have written a PR.  Weird stuff you take for
 granted.
 
 You can close the PR to "not enough information".. unless you know a QNX
 user to ask for more input.  I've finished the contract at the company where
 I was doing the work with QNX.
