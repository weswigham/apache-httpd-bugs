Linux mud 2.0.33 #3 Sun Feb 22 03:46:29 EST 1998 i686
>Description:
We required more open files to create additional sockets for a telnet app. We rebuilt Linux src with NR_OPEN doubled to 1024 (limits.h). Apache will no longer respond to any port. Reset NR_OPEN to 512, and recompile, apache runs fine.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, but this isn't an apache problem.  If you change NR_OPEN
you need to rebuild your C library to take advantage of it... and
you're in totally "unsupported" territory.  Ask on a linux specific
newsgroup or mailing list.
