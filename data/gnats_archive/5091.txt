>Description:
I'm testing using a html & perl script pair of files that are commonly used 
for file-upload.  They are publicly available on:
http://www.terminalp.com/scripts/file_upload.shtml

When a file is specified, it will succeed by uploading the file and displaying
the results page.

However, if the filename is left blank, there is a server error,
and the apache log file indicates "premature end of script headers."

When running the same script using NetscapeFastrack/Unix instead of Apache/Linux,
this bug is not encountered.  I am not absolutely sure of which software
is faulty, but suspect Apache, and am thankful for the free Apache server regardless.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.terminalp.com/scripts/file_upload.shtml
the above URL provides the sample code which uniquely does not work on Apache/Linux.

>Fix:
Perhaps there is an HTML-side fix where you can give the <INPUT Type=FILE> a default value, so that
it is not null passed to Apache.  This is an unknown workaround, and a true
fix may need another patch to apatchy.

 Hi,
 
 You can close this bug listing (5091).
 This ended up being a CGI.pm issue.  I've identified it and fixed it, and sent
 the following to Lstein@cshl.org (CGI.pm owner).
 
 Thanks,
 John

 Here's the bug:
 I'm testing using a html & perl script pair of files that are commonly used
 for file-upload.  They are publicly available on:
 http://www.terminalp.com/scripts/file_upload.shtml
 
 When a file is specified, it will succeed by uploading the file and displaying
 the results page.
 
 However, if the filename is left blank, there is a server error,
 and the apache log file indicates "premature end of script headers."
 *********
 Here's the fix:
 in line 2862 of CGI.pm, change
      unless (defined $filename) {
 to
      unless (defined $filename & $filename gt "") {
 
 This works.  Files are still uploaded, and it doesn't abort when a filename
 isn't specified.
 I only suspect that the problem was that the Netscape browser and/or Apache was
 sending a filename that "existed", but was essentially NULL.
