AIX 4.3.2  0042B67A4C00
>Description:
Installation was done according the description in INSTALL file.
Last message was "You have successfully installed Apache".

Nevertheless the command
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
gives the error:

Syntax error on line 294 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Exspected </Directory> but saw </Directory>
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

The corresponding lines in httpd.conf are:
<Directory />
...
</Directory>

The error occurs for all chapters beginning with
<Directory ...> or <Files ...>

On a different machine with AIX 3.2.5 everthing is working fine
(same way of installation, same directories, same output for 
httpd.conf - except the machine name).

What is wrong, what can I do ?

Thank you very much for your help in advance.
Best regards
