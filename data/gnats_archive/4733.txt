>Description:
We do load balancing with the proxy module (no caching).
There are two problems with our chat cgi script:

The first one is that the proxy module buffers the output from the chat
script, which makes the chat unusable.  There should be a way to turn of
the buffering in the config file for some URL's.

The second is that the proxy module continues the download from the chat
server if the client goes away.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
For the first problem we use the following workaround (the chat script is a
nph script for historical reasons):

The following patch should fix the second one:
