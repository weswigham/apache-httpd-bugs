>Description:
Preface:
If a user is not on the access list, I would like to send them 
to a page where they can request access to that directory.  
That's where I get the following error....


Problem:
If you add the line:
ErrorDocument 401 /cgi-bin/forbidden.cgi?url=/manage/
ErrorDocument 403 /cgi-bin/forbidden.cgi?url=/manage/
to your .htaccess file or httpd.conf file an error occurs.

If your browser (netscape or IE) has not authenticated the
user then the pop-up box that asks you for your username/password 
does not appear and apache automatically sends the user to the 
ErrorDocument redirect page.

If the ErrorDocument redirect page is not in the 
.htaccess/httpd.conf, a pop-up box asks you for your 
username/password.  If you fail the authentication, you get the 
general apache not authorized message.  If you pass the 
authentication, then you get into the directory.

However, if the browser already knows the username/password 
and it encounters an ErrorDocuemnt in the .htaccess file or 
httpd.conf, the server redirects the person to the correct page, 
i.e. if he is on the list, send him to the directory, otherwise 
send the user to the ErrorDocument redirect page.

State-Changed-When: Thu Aug  2 20:19:05 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Your CGI has to output an appropriate status code (eg. "Status: 401"), otherwise it defaults (as per the CGI spec) to a 200, which won't work.
