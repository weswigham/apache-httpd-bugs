>Description:
Installing a binary distribution by running install-bindist.sh causes an extra
slash to appear after the ServerRoot directory.  A comment in httpd.conf says:

  # Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
  ServerRoot "/usr/local/etc/apache/"

However, install-bindist.sh puts a slash at the end of the directory path.

It also puts double slashes in many places, e.g.,

  DocumentRoot "/usr/local/etc/apache//htdocs"
>How-To-Repeat:
run install-bindist.sh
>Fix:
Remove extra slash.  That is, replace line 37 in install-bindist.sh:
  sed -e s%/usr/local/apache%$SR/% $SR/conf/httpd.conf.default > $SR/conf/httpd.conf
with:
  sed -e s%/usr/local/apache%$SR% $SR/conf/httpd.conf.default > $SR/conf/httpd.conf
