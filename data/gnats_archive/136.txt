This is under a clean install of Sun OS 4.1.4 on a brand new Sparc.  
(There are no patches (that I know of) on this version of the kernel.)

Changing the rule for WANTHSREGEX to "no" does not build, as the
proper headers do not exist in the current libraries.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a clean version of Sun OS 4.1.4.
run ./Config.
run make.
watch it go boom.

State-Changed-By: fielding
State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 30 18:17:00 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:

The stock SunOS 4.1.x compiler is not capable of compiling
ANSI C.  We recommend using the gcc compiler from Gnu, or
the acc compiler that comes with some SunOS systems.

State-Changed-When: Sun Apr  6 14:53:55 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Since Apache will never compile with SunOS's compiler
(ie. use gcc), and it is more a problem with SunOS than
Apache so no point in keeping this PR suspended, may as 
well close.
