>Description:
I have found a little bug in all the versions of Apache WebServer for Win32.
The bug consist in sending a string of 8192 chars: command <space> string 0d 0a.
The string is 8190 byte long, the last 2 byte are the return code (0d 0a)
If anyone send this string, Apache give an error at the administrator, and leave the connection alive in idle until the administrator close the crash windows that appear. And if we add 100 other 8192 chars string (for example Accept: (8182 of "A")), the range of memory occupied by the crash is more. In Windows 98 if someone send 2 or more strings from different connection, we have only a crash, but all the connections in idel; instead in Win NT/2000 we have all the crashes and all the connections in idle. I think that someone can use this bug in 2 or more methods:

1) Insert a shellcode in the string because the string is write in memory
2) Open a lot of connection with the 8192 chars string for saturate all resources

I hope that you want to answer me for confirm or not my report, or for other explanations.
Thanks
>How-To-Repeat:
1) GET (8184 of "/") /

2) HEAD /(8182 of "A") /

3) GET (8184 of "/") /
      for 100 times:
   Accept: (8182 of "/")

4) All your fantasy!

State-Changed-Why:

Affected OS2 and Win32, this denial-of-service exploit was
closed in Apache release 1.3.20.

In the case of an extremely long uri, a deeply embedded 
parser properly discarded the request, returning the NULL 
pointer, and the next higher-level parser was not prepared 
for that contigency.  Note further that accessing the NULL
pointer created an exception caught by the OS, causing the
apache process to be immediately terminated.  While this 
exposes a denial-of-service attack, it does not pose an
opportunity for any server exploits or data vulnerability. 

Thank you for your report and discovery, next time please
direct such reports to security@apache.org before using a
public forum such as bugs.apache.org, so we have the chance
to close the exploit and make a patch available before a
vulnerability is widely dissemenated.
