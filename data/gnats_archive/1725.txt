Red Hat Linux 5.0, 2.0.33 Kernel	
>Description:
When Apache creates an errorlog file, STDERR from any CGI's are directed to
the Apache ErrorLog directive file. However, when using a pipe as the ErrorLog
only the "Date and Summary" line gets passed to the program. The STDERR from 
the CGI goes nowhere (or at least never gets seen by the error handler)
>How-To-Repeat:
#!/usr/bin/perl
open MYLOG, ">> /tmp/mylog";
while (<>)
{
    print MYLOG;
}

And then create a CGI with syntax errors and you'll never see them there. :)

 Oh the reason I'm asking this is because I can't reproduce your problem
 with the stock config files + modified ErrorLog directive.

 No. The only logging directives in use are
 
 ErrorLog "|/web/logs/error_handler.pl"
 TransferLog "|/web/logs/access_handler.pl"
 
 It was my understanding that I only use ScriptLog if I want the script's
 STDERR to go "elsewhere" as opposed to the error log.

 Bizarre. Yeah, I just double checked the configs with grep and couldn't
 find that directive anywhere in the configs (just to be sure).
 
 I can make my configs available as a tarball if you think it would help any.

 I tested with:
 
 ErrorLog "| cat >>/tmp/error_log"
 
 What does that do for you?

 Generates solely the "access to /path/to/filename.pl failed for
 somehost.com, reason: Premature end of script headers" error. No perl
 syntax errors of any kind were dumped to that file.
 
 [Sun Feb  8 10:06:15 1998] Server configured -- resuming normal operations
 [Sun Feb  8 10:06:29 1998] access to /home/derek/public_html/test.pl failed
 for hostname.speedchoice.com, reason: Premature end of script headers.
 
 Nothing in between. :(

State-Changed-Why:
I'm sorry but I can't reproduce this.  The only situation in which
stderr won't go to the error log is when you have ScriptLog in
use, but you say you're not using it.

Another difference between your system and mine is that you are
using glibc and I'm using linux libc 5.x.  I hate to blame the
library, but it has been known to be unstable.  Unfortunately
I'm not willing to "upgrade" any of my systems to it, so I
can't test with it.

You're going to have to do more digging.

Like maybe run "strace -f -o trace.out ./httpd -d /path/to/serverroot"
and make a request to a cgi that generates stderr output.  Then
you'll have to kill -9 a bunch of the processes because strace
will interfere with their proper exit.  Eventually you'll get
strace to terminate, and you can look at the trace.out file to
see what happens with stderr.  Or you can send me the trace.out
file, but please only if it's <100k.

 Its entirely possible its a glibc RH5 issue, but in which case, is there
 any estimate as to when someone will have corrected this issue for us RH5
 users? :)
 
 I think I might have 1.2.5 on a RH4.2 machine still in the office (if
 nobody upgraded it while I wasn't looking), in which case I'll try it on
 that and see what I get for results...

 If it is a glibc issue then there's nothing we can do about it.  I forget
 if I asked you to give me strace data... with strace data I can conclude
 if it's glibc or not.  I tried building glibc on the weekend and I wasn't
 able to reproduce the problem you're having.  Mind you, I built 2.0.7-pre1
 to ensure I had the latest bug fixes.  You should be running at least
 2.0.6 btw, there's a redhat update rpm.
 
 Incidentally, how are you starting httpd?  Where do you redirect stderr
 when you do that?
 
 To get the strace stuff try something like this:
 
 - cp httpd.conf test.conf
 - edit test.conf:
     Port 8080
     StartServers 1
     MinSpareServers 1
     MaxSpareServers 2
 
 Then run ./httpd -f /path/to/test.conf and ensure the bug still happens.
 
 Then run strace -ff -o trace.out ./httpd -f /path/to/test.conf and reproduce
 the bug.  Then you may have to kill -9 the httpd and all its children
 because of a deadlock issue with strace.  Don't kill strace... just keep killing
 children of strace until strace exits cleanly (use pstree -lp to find the children).
 
 Then gzip the output and mail it to me.

 Found the problem after a bunch of testing.
 
 Was running suexec and the file permissions on the CGI weren't "proper". 
 
 All I had done was copy the CGI from the "main" server directory to a
 "user" directory, and hadn't even considered that the CGI was never
 getting run, (and an error was being reported in cgi.log stating that it
 COULDN'T run the CGI).
 
 I wonder if it might not be a good idea for future versions to have, if
 suexec fails to execute the script for whatever reason, to log in both
 cgi.log AND error.log. (e.g. instead of error.log only having a
 "generic" failure, have it either refer to cgi.log for details or
 contain a detail of the suexec failure itself).
 
 Aside from that, for all intents and purposes, I think it is safe to
 close this bug report, unless you want to turn it into a suggestion
 ticket of some kind. :)
