Linux 2.2.14-5.0sm
Redhat 6.2, pristine
>Description:
The RPM which contains the latest release of ApacheJServ (ApacheJServ-1.1-2_RH6x.i386.rpm) doesn't correctly configure jserv so that the user can get to the status page (/jserv, /status).  I was able to get it working by making the following change.

The RPM adds these lines:

<IfModule mod_jserv.c>
             Include /etc/httpd/conf/jserv/jserv.conf
</IfModule>


I changed them to:

<IfModule mod_jserv.c>
             Include /etc/httpd/conf/jserv/jserv.conf
        <Location /jserv>
                SetHandler jserv-status
                order deny,allow
                deny from all
                allow from 128.187.171.180
        </Location>
        <Location /status>
                SetHandler jserv-status
                order deny,allow
                deny from all
                allow from 128.187.171.180
        </Location>
</IfModule>


>How-To-Repeat:
Install the RPM and try accessing http://localhost/jserv with no other modifications (BTW, after the RPM installs it tells the user to check http://localhost/jserv, so this functionality is assumed to be working right out of the package).
>Fix:
This is a minor packaging issue/bug, but will save some headaches if you build it in.  The spec file just needs to be modified accordingly.

Thanks.
