Debian 2.2, kernel 2.4.8:

Linux gemini 2.4.8 #1 SMP Sun Aug 19 22:54:09 EDT 2001 i686 unknown

>Description:
Upon specifying that the 'txt' extension should be text/plain and displayed as plaintext, if the &LT;HTML&GT; tag appears in the text at any place, the whole text will be treated as an HTML document REGARDLESS of what the mime type for that extension is set at.
>How-To-Repeat:
Default install of Apache.  Create a text file that has loads of text and an HTML tag (the exact signification of the start of an HTML document) anywhere in the text.  The whole text should be presented as HTML instead of plaintext.
>Fix:
I tried forcing every file to be displayed as plaintext by using the ForceType directive, to no avail.  Is this a problem with Apache or most common browsers?

 Sounds like you have mod_mime_magic enabled.  Check your configuration.
