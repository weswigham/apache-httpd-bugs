** Continual segment violations, to the tune of almost 1 per minute,
are slowly eating away at server memory resources.  Free memory gets
depleted until a server reboot is necessary.  Memory not being freed.

>How-To-Repeat:
Just run Apache/1.2b8, and do "vmstat" over a period of days.
On a heavily-loaded site, you will soon find that memory is not
being reclaimed, and the grim reaper soon visits.  I can give
you access to my site, if need be.

A salary for the developers might be a nice start.%0
