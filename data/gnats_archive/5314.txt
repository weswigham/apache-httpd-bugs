NT 4.0 SP 5
>Description:
I installed the server in an other Directory than C:\Apache. I can start the Server directly by calling the EXE.-file. The Server is also running as a NT-Service as long as the directory C:\Apache\logs exists. After deleting C:\Apache\log the server can't run anymore as a service. The httpd.conf doesn't contain any path to C:\Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install the server to C:\Program Files\Apache. Delete C:\Apache. Install server as NT-service. Try to start the server.

State-Changed-Why:
Works fine for me on a nearly identical setup. You should:
1. make sure earlier versions of Apache are not installed as a service (apache -u)
2. install as a service using apache -i, or optionally, apache -i -n <service_name>
3. use net start <service_name>
where service_name is the service name specified on the -n 
option or is apache (apache is the default service name)
