>Organization:
>Environment:
WS NT 4.0, SP6
>Description:
We use Novell network map drives on our Apache server (like s:)
We have this line on our httpd.conf: DocumentRoot "s:/home"
The error message is: "[...] File does not exist: s:/home/accueil.htm"
But the file exist and is available from the windows explorer or from a "dos" console.
Apache run as a service, as a local user "intranet", who belong to the admin group.
All is as the child process created by the first Apache.exe could not access to the network ressources (drives)
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes: try to map a drive to a network disk (shared directory on a Netware server or a NT WS or server)and use it as DocumentRoot directory.
>Fix:
Maybe to force the child to run as a specific user ?

State-Changed-Why:
Correct, see htdocs/manual/win_service.html for how to
run-as-user and enable shared network drives.
