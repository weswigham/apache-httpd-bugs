>Environment:
SCO Open Server 5.0.2, cc
8% uname -a 
SCO_SV pinguin 3.2 2 i386
>Description:
Can't compile:
gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSCO5 `../apaci` alloc.c 
alloc.c: In function `spawn_child_core': 
alloc.c:1949: `STDOUT_FILENO' undeclared (first use this function) 
alloc.c:1949: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once 
alloc.c:1949: for each function it appears in.) 
alloc.c:1955: `STDIN_FILENO' undeclared (first use this function) 
alloc.c:1961: `STDERR_FILENO' undeclared (first use this function) 
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
When I fix this by adding 
#define STDIN_FILENO 0 
#define STDOUT_FILENO 1 
#define STDERR_FILENO 2
to src/include/ap_config.h (section SCO 5), I end up with
gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSCO5 `../apaci` buff.c 
buff.c: In function `ap_bhalfduplex': 
buff.c:570: storage size of `tv' isn't known 
*** Error code 1 (bu21)

Hi

I had this problem too

I saw that ap_config_auto.h had
#define HAVE_unistd_h 1

whereas ap_config.h checked for
HAVE_UNISTD_H

changing the (autogenerated) ap_config_auto.h by hand allowed a clean
compile.
hope this helps :)


I'll report more if I find more

David

PS Helmut - you've probably sussed this by now but there is no more
feedback on the bug report
----   so I've CC'ed you just in case :)
