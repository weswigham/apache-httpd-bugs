>Description:
There are cgi programs which write temporary data files as 
owner: nobody group: web.  The directory that the files are created in is of 
permission:  drwx----wx  14 ebs  web.  This directory is world writable.

I increased Min/MaxServers, then killed and started apache via apachctl.
When I did this, nobody files were of permission -rw-r-r--.  I then killed 
and started apache again, and now the temporary files are of permission:
-rw-rw-r--.

httpd.conf is set for:
User nobody
Group nobody

/etc/group is set for:
......
web:*:69:root,ebs,cam,webadmin
ebs:*:1000:
cam:*:1001:
kevlo:*:1002:
webadmin:*:1003:
nogroup:*:65533:
nobody:*:65534:

>How-To-Repeat:
I don't have a good way to reproduce this sorry.
>Fix:
should i add in /etc/group the user nobody to the web group?

should i change httpd.conf to run as user nobody group web?

sorry for my ignorance with some obvious things i'm still learning.

thank you very much.

State-Changed-Why:
You appear to be a bit confused about Unix permissions.

First, you claim the CGI creates files as group web, but
then you REMOVE permission for group web to write to the
directory by not having it group writable.

You don't make it clear exactly what you want to happen and
what you were seeing happen, but the mode on files created
is determined by your CGI, in combination with the umask.
If you have a different umask when starting the process, then
the default modes will be different.

There really doesn't look like there is anything wrong with
Apache here; we really can't teach you how Unix permissions
work...
