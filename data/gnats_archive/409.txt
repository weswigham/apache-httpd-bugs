>How-To-Repeat:
I did a "http://budapest/cgi-bin/finger.cgi
>Fix:
Could it be something in compiling or the conf files ? In compiling, none of the options 
got changed. It was compiled "out of the box"

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: coar@decus.org
State-Changed-When: Thu Apr 17 08:33:14 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Your CGI script is in error.  The first line should be
"#!/usr/bin/ksh" (note that you're currently missing the
initial octothorpe).  Also, remove the 'echo " "' from
before the "Content-type" line; the first thing the script
emits must *not* be a blank line.  Some of this should
have been indicated by entried in the errorlog; did you
look there?

Thank you for using Apache!
