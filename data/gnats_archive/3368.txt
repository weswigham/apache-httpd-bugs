>Description:
I write a html file , include <a href="test.xls"></a>
when I push it , I can not download it.

I have set "application/x-msexcel" to an download exe file in the netscape brower.
I have set "application/x-msexcel" in the file mime.types on the Sun server.
Why?

The another:

I delete the "application/msword" line in the mime.types file, but I can download Word File.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I can download excel file from "netscape Server" in my brower.
 so I think it is the problem of Apache.
