>Release:        1.3b2
>Environment:
NT4SP3, VC++5, perl5.00404, mod_perl-1.05
>Description:
Creating GIF in a CGI script results in garbage output. Same script run from mod_perl or another web server gives Ok result.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install GD library for perl. Hack one of the examples to print its result to stdout. If interested, contact me, I send you an example script. However, any other binary interaction should do : gzip-ing something, copying  a graphic whatever
>Fix:
replace line 1221 of ../src/main/alloc.c from
#define enc_pipe(fds) _pipe(fds, 512, O_TEXT | O_NOINHERIT)
to
#define enc_pipe(fds) _pipe(fds, 512, O_BINARY | O_NOINHERIT)
