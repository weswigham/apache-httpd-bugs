NT 4.0, Binary Release from www.apache.org
>Description:
The problem with the 16-Bit CGIs is still in 1.3.1. 
This is an addition to my PR listed http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/2773
Running .cmd-files as CGI in the same installation works fine. Seems to 
be a problem with 16-Bit Apps.   1.3.0b6 worked perfectly, 1.3.b7 was the first
version with this problem.
Due to that, i have to run the 1.3.b6 which has the nasty problem with 
the concurrent CGIs.

Any hints / help welcome! :-)
Greetings,
Matthias Hertzog
>How-To-Repeat:
I can send you all the needed Source, Binaries and Configs if needed.
>Fix:
Exaclty the same cfgs and .CGI on my Win95-machine works perfectly.

State-Changed-Why:
Using the latest code from CVS, I was able to successfully execute the 16 bit CGI that was posted in PR 2494.  Would it be possible for you to obtain a later version of apache (1.3.2) and retry the CGI?  Thanks!!!
