Solaris 2.5.1, gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
I have www.venus.co.uk on one IP address, www.client.co.uk on another.  Some
documents I redirect with the Alias call with the intention that www.venus.co.uk/manuals goes to a certain
place in the filesystem, eg /export/web/manuals.  Only, www.client.co.uk/manuals
ALSO takes me there.

I have virtualHost  with the doc root setup OK, in that the virtual host answers
to it's IP address etc and serves up the docs it is supposed to.  What am I doing wrong?

I can repeat the problem on Linux 2.0.0 with 1.8b8 as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
www.venus.co.uk/rtfm -  the rtfm stuff should only come up if the web server's name
is www.venus.co.uk.
www.lingard.co.uk/rtfm - the same files, but they should not appear.
