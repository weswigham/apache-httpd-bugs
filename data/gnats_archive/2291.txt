>Environment:
WinNT Service Pack 3, pre-compiled.
>Description:
It does not seem like 1.3b7 is passing all of the info posted to the CGI program or script.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to www.funkymonkey.net/cgi-bin/vcenter/vcenter.pl and try clicking on anything, it reloads the page as if the script were called with no variables.  Been using the script since b3 with no problems, config files and everything are the same as before.
>Fix:
Nope.
