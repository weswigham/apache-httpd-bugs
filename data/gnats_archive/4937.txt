>Environment:
Windows NT Service Pack 5
>Description:
A couple of weeks ago.....I uninstalled the Win32 version of 1.3.6
and installed version 1.3.9. After the installation, none of my CGI
scripts ran......I use ActivePerl version 519 by ActiveState.......
and a perl wrapper written in C........

I uninstalled version 1.3.9 and reinstalled 1.3.6 and
everything worked just fine......

Tried installing 1.3.9 one more time and the same thing happened.....
so I reverted back to 1.3.6 and that's what I am running now.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try running CGI scripts on WinNT using the 1.3.9 server.....
>Fix:
No.

Comment-Added:
Your CGI scripts probably create subprocesses. If so, then
the bug has been reported and fixed in the development
tree. If you have a compiler, you can download the latest
code here: http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs.
