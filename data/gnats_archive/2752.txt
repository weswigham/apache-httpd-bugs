>Description:
I am trying to run the server dirctly from your DLL.  I spawn a new thread and run call your apache_main() copying your apache.exe.  When I do this, my program suddenly starts spawning itself over and over again.  Is there a better way of running your web server as a part of my .exe or should I run it through your apache.exe?
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a windows app that spawns a child thread whose porpuse is running the web server.
>Fix:
Not yet...

State-Changed-When: Fri Jul 31 14:44:32 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Apache is a program, not just some DLL you can call.  There
are implicit assumptions that have to be made about the
environment of the process.  It is not designed to be
called from some other program and won't owkr that way.
