win 95
>Description:
I have aol 5.0 and installed the apache server for local use on my win 95 pc. When I try to call http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1, I get an error message that something is wrong with the DNS or so. When I run ipconfig, it says my ip-adress is 0.0.0.0, but when I type that, I get the same error. Does it have something to do with that, that it tries to connect to 127.0.0.1 when I type localhost, although it is 0.0.0.0? in the error-log it say something like "can´t get no winscok for port 80" What does that mean?
Someone told me that there are usually problems with aol and webservers in general. Did you hear about this and can you help me? Do you need any further information on the error messages?

I expect this problem is caused by AOL, and there's nothing
we can do about it. Sorry.
