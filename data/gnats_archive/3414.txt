Solaris v2.5.1
>Description:
While trying to trigger a subprocess that takes two hours to complete from a 
CGI program in C, it was discovered that as soon as the parent CGI process
exits having forked the subprocess as a child, Apache kills the child, and
thus the two hour subprocess.

This seems to be done to prevent runaway CGIs, however there does not seem
to be a configurable workaround for this should this functionality be needed.

Provide a configurable workaround on a per script or per directory basis

State-Changed-Why:
(closing very old Apache bug report)

Apache does not kill any processes spawned off by CGIs.  If it is being killed, it is by something else or for some other reason.
