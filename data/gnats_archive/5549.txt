>Description:
As you know, ErrorLog could be used to make Apche log its errors to a given
syslog facility.

The problem is that if some module also uses syslog for it logging needs
and sets a different facility, then all subsequent Apache errors are logged
to the last facility  instead of using the facility set by user with ErrorLog.
>How-To-Repeat:
I found this problem when I used a PHP script that uses the syslog
functionality of PHP, and I found it also in a RADIUS authentication module
I wrote that uses syslog to log its errors.
>Fix:
The solution is simple: the facility set with ErrorLog should be reset every
time Apache have to log an error message, instead of setting it only at server
startup time.
