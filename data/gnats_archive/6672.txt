Solaris 2.6 Generic_105181-13 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10
>Description:
Previous release of apache (1.3.12) would change the hostname for clients
to the entry specified with the ServerName directive as expected

Just upgraded my installation this morning, and now the hostname remains
that specified in the client. 

Config files are the same as before.
>How-To-Repeat:
using true FQDN  http://maynard.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/index.htm
using DNS Alias  http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/index.htm
using IP          http://142.36.5.25/index.htm

http.conf entry is:

ServerName www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca

also 
UseCanonicalName On
and mod_rewrite is in use.

In the past this would ALWAYS remap to the 

http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/index.htm

form.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Fri Oct 13 14:30:15 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

The ServerName directive does not do automatic redirects.
It only determines the hostname Apache will use when
it is forced to construct a redirect (for example,
when you leave off the trailing slash in accessing a 
directory).

Perhaps what you had before the upgrade was the
configuration described in the
"Canonical Hostnames" section of
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/rewriteguide.html
