>Description:
Hi,
After I get this :
[error] server reached MaxClients setting, consider raising the MaxClients setting
In my error log apache won't handle any clients anymore... It looks like apache don't kill the old processes.
This is a huge problem. I use Apache 1.3.9, I've the same problem with apache 1.3.6.
I use PHP 3.0.12.

Any solutions ?

State-Changed-Why:
You need to provide some more details and try to look into
what is going on a bit more.

Are you using NFS?

Enable mod_status, then look at the server-status page over
time.  Is it filling up?  Are there slots that claim to be
active but haven't had a request serviced in a long time?

How many httpds are running soon after you start the server?
Does that grow evenly, or in big leaps?  If evenly, find
one of the httpds that has been sitting around and not doing
anything for a while and run strace or gdb on it to see what
it is doing.

 Hi,
 I resolved the bug myself.
 Try this : commandout your ErrorLog (the main not of a virtual host) and
 make the
 MaxClients real low.
 
 #ErrorLog logs/error_log
 MaxClients 200
 
 If the server gets to his max clients te server will write to the
 error_log!!
 But we don't have an errorlog. If this hapens the server will stop serving.
