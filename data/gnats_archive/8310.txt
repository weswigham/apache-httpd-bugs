I believe this is AIX 4.3.  It's a pretty big server - 4 CPUs and 8 GB RAM.
I attempted to compile Apache with the IBM native compiler, but though it
compiles, it doesn't run.  A little debugging seemed to indicate that C
pointer aliases weren't handled correctly, as unlikely as that seems.
So, I'm using gcc version 2.95.3.
>Description:
Apache 1.3.19 on AIX does not kill idle child processes down to MaxSpareServers.
1.3.19 on Linux does.

>How-To-Repeat:
Build and install apache from source on AIX.
Edit httpd.conf to allow server-status.
Add "sleep 5" to the begining of cgi-bin/test-cgi, and run "chmod +x test-cgi".
Launch a browser, and point to "http://127.0.0.1/server-status".

Install wget, then run this script:
#!/bin/sh
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 a b c d e f g h i j; do
 wget http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/test-cgi &
done

(or use "lynx -dump http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/test-cgi &"
if wget is not available.)

Refresh the browser pointing to "http://127.0.0.1/server-status".
You should see 20 apache children.  Once the children become idle,
one should move from a "." (idle) to a "_" (no process) each second.

On Linux, (Red Hat 7), this is what you see.  On AIX, the idle processes
hang around forever.

I instrumented the code under AIX with fprintf's to a file.  
The code in http_main.c to send the SIGUSR1 to kill an idle child does
get executed.  It attempts to kill the same child once a second forever.
The child PID shows up in "ps".

The code to set the signal handler for the child is
set to "just_die".  However, the signal handler, "just_die" never
seems to be called.

When the server is shut down (apache_ctl stop), all process are correctly
killed.  There doesn't seem to be any significant delay in this process,
leading me to believe that it doesn't resort to SIGTERM or SIGKILL, though
I won't swear to it.  I instrumented all the calls to signal that set
the signal to ignore, and didn't find any at run time.  This seems unlikely,
but I'm not really sure what I should expect.

 Additional information.  Bug 6919 describes how to
 compile Apache with the native Aix C compiler.
 I applied the patch, and tested for the child process
 bug.  It persists.  That points the finger more
 squarely at the OS, and less at the compiler.

Comment-Added:
Actually, there is a problem in the pthread mutex code in
recent levels of Apache 1.3 which can result in this situation (not being able to kill idle children).  I've only seen it occur on AIX but the problem is in the generic Apache code for pthread mutex handling, not in any AIX-specific area.  I don't believe that anybody is working on a fix for this.

If it is a problem that idle children aren't being terminated, the work-around is to switch to fcntl serialization.  There are two ways to do this:

1) upgrade to the latest Apache 1.3 and put "acceptmutex fcntl" in your config file
2) for older Apache 1.3 on AIX, edit src/Configure, find the appropriate AIX stanza for your version, and remove "-DUSE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT" from CFLAGS and rebuild
