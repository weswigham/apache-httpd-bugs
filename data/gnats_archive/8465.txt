The follown line is the result of the "uname -a" command.
# SunOS oemmail 5.8 Generic_108529-05 i86pc i386 i86pc

And I am using gcc 2.95.3 compiler.
>Description:
The configuration option is following;
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-shared=max

The "make" command and the "make install" command were excuted successfully.

But, When I did not modify the httpd.conf file and ran the "/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl configtest" command,
I received the following error message.
Syntax error on line 205 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_env.so into server: ld.so.1: /usr/loca
l/apache/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_
env.so: symbol ap_palloc: referenced symbol not found
