>Description:
I am using apache 1.2.0 on a SGI O2 with IRIX 6.3. I tried to build
additional HTTP header entries by using http-equiv tags within the HEAD
section of HTML documents. 

Unfortunately, apache seems to ignore those entries, so that e.g. no
expires, based on http-equiv tags, can be passed to proxies.

Is there a way to tell apache, to interpret http-equiv's?

State-Changed-Why:
Apache does not deal with META tags in the HTML; that
is for the client to do.  META tags are not designed
to set HTTP headers, they are designed (some would say
very poorly) to allow some information to go from somewhere
to somewhere in some way.  Apache does not and should not
parse the contents of the document before sending the
headers.
