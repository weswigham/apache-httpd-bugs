System is Red Hat on a Cobalt Raq2

Same problem as submitted in bug #2214
all directories are world readable
Following is the .htaccess file:

AuthType Basic
AuthName "MVP Support"
AuthUserFile /home/sites/site3/users/mdrmvp/support-users
require valid-user

The error log has the following entry:

[Wed Feb  7 17:12:12 2001] [error] (2)No such file or directory: access to / failed for 63.91.95.135, reason: 
User not known to the underlying authentication module

I have even tried changing the password, but get the same results.

I'll be happy to provide any additional information required.

Thanks in advance

State-Changed-Why:

Cobalt uses a hacked-up version of Apache which
authenticates from the system password file, and
ignores the AuthUserFile.

Please consider using a "real" version of Apache that
doesn't have this problem, or report it as a bug
to Cobalt.

Thanks for using Apache!
