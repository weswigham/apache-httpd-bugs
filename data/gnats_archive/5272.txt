>Description:
Hi,

I followed instructions between the lines of 167 to 171 in
the file "README.configure" and changed PREFIX to 
/home/perry/apache:


    $ ./configure --prefix=/home/perry/apache \
                  --enable-module=most \
                  --enable-shared=max
    $ make
    $ make install

It was successfully compiled and installed.  But I got errors
when I tried to start apache server.  The following is the detailes:

/home/perry/apache/bin > apachectl start &
av20010:/home/perry/apache/bin > Syntax error on line 207 of 
/home/perry/apache/conf/httpd.conf:  Cannot load 
/home/perry/apache/libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so into server: 
ld.so.1: /home/perry/apache/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error:
file /home/perry/apache/libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so: symbol 
ap_table_setn: referenced symbol not found
.//apachectl start: httpd could not be started

[2]    Exit 3                        apachectl start


I did not touch the file, "apache/conf/httpd.conf".  The 
followings are the commands I typed.  Could you please
tell me what cauesed the problem ?

1.  tar xvf apache_1.3.9.tar
2.  cd apache_1.3.9
3.  ./configure --prefix=/home/perry/apache \
                --enable-module=most \
                --enable-shared=max
4.  make
5.  make install
6.  cd ../apache/bin
7.  apachectl start &

Then I got the following errors:

av20010:/home/perry/apache/bin > Syntax error on line 207 of 
/home/perry/apache/conf/httpd.conf:  Cannot load 
/home/perry/apache/libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so into server: 
ld.so.1: /home/perry/apache/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: 
file /home/perry/apache/libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so: 
symbol ap_table_setn: referenced symbol not found
.//apachectl start: httpd could not be started

[2]    Exit 3                        apachectl start


Your attention will be highly appreciated.
