When trying to access a Database through the apache webserver using netscape communicator 4.06
.mdb files are returned as text files. If I open the same page as a local file 
(directory mounted to my pc) it returns as a database. If I use Internet 
explorer it is brought back as a Database.

http://viper/shared_drive/databases is the directory that links to 
the most databases.

State-Changed-Why:
You need to configure your server to setup a proper MIME type
for the file; you have configured the server (probably through the
default type) to send it as text/html.

How to do this is outlined in the docs, via either modifying
your mime.types file or using an AddType directive.

This is not really something appropriate to be submitting to
the bugdb.

 Because MSIE is broken and does not comply with HTTP standards.  It
 tries to guess what it should do with content; while sometimes it
 can be right on misconfigured servers, it is very often wrong and
 just messes everything up.
