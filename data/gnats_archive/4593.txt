SunOS homer 5.6 Generic_105181-04 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-4
gcc version 2.8.1
GNU Make version 3.76.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
Also occurs on stock solaris /usr/ccs/bin/make
>Description:
The configuration of apache seems to work okay,
unfortunately when I run make it seems to loop and keep
making the apache source mulitple times, each time it loops
it also spawns another make.  I found this bug because the make 
OS complained of not enough open files so I unlimited the file
descriptors to 1024 and it still occured.

Doing a ps -ef | egrep make showed multiple copies ofmake
all doing the same thing.

I also grabbed another copy of the source incase it was a
problem with the first copy I downloaded but the bug still occurs.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try configuring and running make

Please show exactly what command line you are using to
configure and the output of trying to build it to show where
it starts looping.

 I seem to have fixed this now, what appears to happen
 is that when configure is run it creates symlinks in each
 of the directories it creates pointing to it's origrinal in 
 the src directory, deleting the link in modules/standard and
 the link in modules appears to have rectified the problem
 and it no longer loops.
 
 Thanks
