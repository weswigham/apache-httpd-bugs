Solaris 2.5 -- Generic_103093-25 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
The configure script doesn't seem to support activating
a new module as a DSO.  I tried various combinations of the
--activate-module and --enable-shared options to no avail.
>How-To-Repeat:
My scenario consisted of creating a src/modules/blah directory with
the right stuff to build libblah.so and then running configure as
follows:

./configure --shadow --enable-module=so --enable-module=most \
 --enable-shared=proxy --activate-module=src/modules/blah/libblah.so \
 --enable-shared=blah
>Fix:
I got around it by adding an --activate-shared option.
My bloated implementation duplicates the --activate-module
code, with a few small changes, and works for me on Solaris
like this:

./configure --shadow --enable-module=so --enable-module=most \
 --enable-shared=proxy --activate-shared=src/modules/blah/libblah.so

The only changes over --with-activate-module are:

>             echo "## (configure --activate-shared=$file)" >>$addconf
>             echo "SharedModule $modfile" >>$addconf

and:

>             eval "shared_$module=yes"

 No, it _does_ support this.

 I've tried this with a sample module and it worked fine.  I don't know why
 --enable-shared=blah doesn't work for you, but the code is correct and it
 works for me. I cannot reproduce your problem.
