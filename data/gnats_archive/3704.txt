Everything is fine up to this point. Apache compiles without errors.
Now using /usr/local/apachefp/sbin/apachectl start
Every module gets an undefined symbol error. ie:
mod_env.so undefined symbol "ap_palloc" or
mod_log_confic.so undefined symbol "ap_table_get"
and Apache will not start.
After I have commented out every module in the httpd.conf then Apache will start.
I am trying to get the modules to work so I can use the Frontpage extentions.
It even gets mod_frontpage.so undefined symbol "ap_pstrcat"

Please try using a current version of Apache (ie. 1.3.4),
as we clearly ask you before you submit a report.

 Yes that did it. I did not see the part about the new 1.3.4 version when
 I submitted this,sorry. Now I need to find a version of Frontpage module
 for the new version of Apache.
 Thanks for the help.
