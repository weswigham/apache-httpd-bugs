Win 98 SE
>Description:
Apache crashes unexpectedly every time I attempt to run it. In the log file, I get this error:
[crit] make_sock: failed to get a socket for port 80
1) Winsock 2 is installed
2) netstat shows no connections
3) Computer is not connected to Internet (I use Apache as a local host to test PHP scripts)
>How-To-Repeat:
Apache on the same system used to function properly before
>Fix:
-> In IE, go to Service->Properties, choose Connections tab, press Install. Choose an option which says you're connected to the Internet through a modem, choose some dummy modem make. Some drivers will get installed to your machine from the distribution. Apparently, this fixes the problem.
->Another way is to go to a corresponding section of Windows Settings dialog (perhaps Connections or Telephony) and repeating the above steps.

State-Changed-Why:
Clearly, if you are using a web server without a connection
to the internet, the severity of this report cannot be
classified as 'critical'.

Apache is a TCP/IP based HTTP server, so if you aren't using
TCP/IP or HTTP itself, then it's all rather pointless anyway, no?

But the bit you might have been missing is the 'Microsoft
Loopback Adapter' network device, which you can install.
It isn't really an adapter, it's just a test device for
situtations like yours.  Since this has nothing to do with
Apache, try news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
newsgroup for more help.
