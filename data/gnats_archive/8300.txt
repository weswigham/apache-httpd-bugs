>Description:
Okay, here's my problem: I've installed on a WinNT 4.0 the Apache WebServer 1.3.20. I already installed PHP and MySQL. So far, so good. This all works very fine. But just now I've installed AcivePerl to run CGI-Scripts. I've made all changes in the httpd.conf. Bu every time I want to execute a cgi-script, I'm getting an error-message like this:
  [Wed Sep 05 16:21:26 2001] [error] [client 138.201.77.3] couldn't spawn child process: d:/inetpub/cgi-bin/yabb/yabb.cgi
I've searched in the bug-database to find an solution for my problem, but I didn't find anything. So, if anyone can help me or knows what to do, then PLEASE HELP ME. It's very important.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
