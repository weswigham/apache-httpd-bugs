>Description:
I get the following error messages in the suexec logfile:

[1998-10-06 12:38:14]: uid: (lccd/lccd) gid: (lccd/lccd) cmd: test.cgi
[1998-10-06 12:38:14]: target uid/gid (217/217) mismatch with directory (217/8888) or program (217/8888)  

I took a look at the Apache and suexec sourcen and logs of strace and 
tracked down the problem to:

The called CGI script test.cgi has the ownership: uid=lccd/217,gid=eucgi/8888
Apache starts suexec with uid=lccd/217 and gid=lccd/217.

So the comparision of the GIDs inside suexec fails. The httpd runs on
a special WWW account (uid=www,gid=eucgi/8888). Where does Apache takes the
GID=lccd from. The account "lccd" belongs to the groups "lccd" and "eucgi".
Does Apache take the first group ?

I also tried to set USER and GROUP inside the virtual host section - without
succuess. 

The main question seems to be: where is the GID for the suexec call taken from ??

Any idea ?

I think this is fixed in Apache 1.3.9.  Can you please
test and see if you can reproduce the problem with that
version?
