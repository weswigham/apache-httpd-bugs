>Description:
I've tried using LogFormat options documented at http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html which do not work with Apache 1.3.9.  The options %B, %H, %m, and %q are documented but are not handled
by the parse function in mod_log_config.c and result in an error like this
when httpd is started:

Syntax error on line 537 of /usr/local/etc/apache/httpd.conf:
Unrecognized LogFormat directive %m

State-Changed-Why:
These LogFormat options were introduced after Apache 1.3.9
was released.  Unfortunately, the LogFormat options have
changed many times over many releases, and documenting
when each change was made would be a big mess.  I suggest
using the docs that came with your version of Apache
or upgrading to the latest version of Apache.
Thanks.
