IRIX shelob 6.2 03131015 IP22

>Description:
We have noticed some particular GIF and JPEG files seem to get corrupted
when dowloading or viewing them.  That is, the files downloaded are
exactly the same size but the contents are slightly different, when
a checksum value is computed.

This may not be immediately obvious when viewing the images, but in the section
below on how to repeat the problem, I show how you can easily test this out.

Note that this only happens for SOME images.  Other images (gif or jpeg)
download perfectly every time.  Also, some images that are very similar
in size to problem images also download perfectly.  It's almost as if
the content of the image is to blame.

I doubt this is a problem with the way the apache web server is configured
because I tested this out on a Sun Sparc (Solaris 2.6, Apache 1.2.5)
and the problem images from our Irix web server downloaded perfectly
under Solaris.  That Solaris web server is set up essentially
identically to the Irix one we are having trouble with.
>How-To-Repeat:
Repeatedly visit:

http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/test1.gif and
http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/test1.jpg

Repeated downloads of those images should result in files of differing
content.  The easiest way is to run from the unix shell something like this:

# while true
# do
#    wget http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/test1.jpg
#    wget http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/test1.gif
# done

Control-C out of that after up to 50 downloads.

Then compare the checksums since the files are the same size.

# cksum test1.gif*
# cksum test1.jpg*

A lot should be very different.  Make sure you don't use a proxy
server with wget.

Also check exactly where the differences lie in the files.

# cmp test1.jpg test1.jpg.1
# cmp test1.jpg.1 test1.jpg.2
...etc

The differences all seem to occur at the same point.

State-Changed-Why:
This appears to be another broken IRIX problem.  It likes to
magically corrupt data that is sent because it is dumb.

Did you compile with -n32?  If so, don't.  If not, try it.

Do you have all the SGI patches applied?

This _is_ almost certainly an IRIX bug and numerous people
running IRIX have had the same problem.  There is a patch
that one of them submitted that I will dig up and send you when
I get a chance to see if it helps.  If not, you may want to
talk to SGI if you have a support contract and tell them
IRIX is broken.  I have been meaning to talk to a contact
 there and see if they are aware of this, if it is resolved,
etc.

 Hmm.  Wonder if a simple standalone test program could reproduce this...
 would make it easier to convince SGI.
 
 Ah.  The corruption starts at the beginning of a packet:

 Sigh.

 FYI.
 
 If you do have a support contract, get in touch with SGI and try forcing
 the issue.  The more pressure from outside, the more likely it will get
 fixed.  The actual developers that do the code often don't have much say
 in anything, so don't bug Steve about it.
 
 You could try backing out patches, but you can go crazy trying that...

 There are rumors of a corruption problem in some recent 6.2 kernel rollup
 patches, but I don't have any details yet.

 This problem disappeared with the installation of the latest Irix 6.2
 kernel and networking patches.  So it was definitely an Irix 6.2 operating
 system problem and not a problem with the Apache software.
