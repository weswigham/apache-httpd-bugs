>Description:
When using LoadModule directive with no path for the module name, mod_so assumes
the module is relative to the server_root (uses ap_server_root_relative).  In
other words, the server root must contain all the files that apache will 
reference including shared modules not just the application specific files,
such as document root and cgi-bin, etc.

This behavior causes a problem when running Apache from a hard disk with the 
Server Root being a CDROM with ISO level 1 (8.3 naming convention).  For 
example,  the following directive: "LoadModule jserv_module ApacheModuleJServ.dll"
 will fail if the server root is pointing to a CDROM ISO Level 1 even if 
apache is started from the hard disk with all the share modules co-located.  
The basic problem is that Apache assumes all it's resources, such as, shared 
modules are relative to the server root when relative paths are used.  Apache 
should be able to support loading it's from both an absolute path and the 
standard search path.  
executables, etc from the location from which it is started.   
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes.  Install apache and point it's server root to a location which doesnot
contain the share modules (ie. ApacheModuleJServ.dll).  You will get a 
can not load "Server root"/ApacheModuleJserv.dll" into server error.
>Fix:
Yes.  Update mod_so.c so it will check the full path for the shared module and
it that fails, strip the path and use the default system search algorithm to
find the module.  A context diff for a potential fix follows:

State-Changed-Why:
Magically looking for DLLs in any which directory is bad.
We want to avoid that.

Why don't you just give the proper path to it in the
LoadModule line?  That works fine for me.

     relative to ap_server_root.
 
 Marc,
 
 I would like to use static configuration files on all systems where document
 root is a CDROM.  The drive
 letter of the CDROM can be different from system to system and even
 different on the same system with
 multiple CDROMs.  Tying the server root to the support modules appears to be
 arbitrary and not very
 intuitive.  I would like to thing the generic components of Apache could
 reside anywhere and the servlets,
 cgi-bin scripts, etc that are tied to the data are in the server root
 directory.  The current implememtation
 requires each server root to have all the apache components present,
 therefore, one can not simply
 change the server root to point to a new "data set".   Note: the proposal
 did not change the current
 behavior,  but extended it to allow the dlls to reside with apache.exe
 independent of the server root.
 
 This proposal may not conform to the design philosophy of the Apache
 product, however, the current approach arbitarily loads dlls from where
 apache was loaded (ApacheCore.dll) and other dlls from
 DocumentRoot/modules/ such as ApacheModuleJServ.dll which seems to be a
 combination of  "any which directory". The search order of dlls is
 well-documented, although it is magical based upon you current
 directory.
 
 I don't mean to cause a lot of trouble, I already made the change, however,
 I thought others may want to
 perform the same type of thing - switching between multiple "data sets"
 without requiring all the apache
 components to be available on each one.  This was just an attempt at
 providing some useful feedback
 on the Apache product.  You can take it or leave it.
 
 John.

Comment-Added:

Specify the full path... this should be working.

Win32 is very picky about using true backslashes '\' in
LoadLibrary calls.  This may have posed this problem.
