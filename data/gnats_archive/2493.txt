gdbm version 1.7.3		
>Description:
When configuring Apache with mod_rewrite and gdbm requests, I get a "Bad Request"
response when accessing documents tha requires database lookups...
httpd.conf:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteMap    alias-to-account  dbm:/db/users
RewriteRule   ^/~w-(.....)(.*)  ${alias-to-account:$1|w-$1}/html$2 [L]

I'm using the database file for user account lookups, becouse 30K+ user /etc/passwd
is very slow.
>How-To-Repeat:
I linked the gdbm library with apache by;
Configuration;
EXTRA_LIBS=-lgdbm

And then configured according to the "Full Description" section.
I'm also running the httpd as root in a chrooted enviroment.
This problem occurd by release 1.2.5 and is still in the 1.3.0 version.
I'm now running the 1.2.4 version of apache and it's working fine.

State-Changed-Why:
A "Bad request" response usually indicates that you
rewrite to an illegal URL. You should first use the
RewriteLog directive with "RewriteLogLevel 9" to
find the reason, i.e. to what your URLs are rewritten to.
And when the GDBM stuff is the problem you should
remember: The DBM library Apache is linked with has
to be the same which is used for creating your db.users
file. Don't link Apache with GDBM and create the
db.users with a tool which uses the vendor DBM lib.
Instead I recomend you to just use Solaris DBM, it
works ok.
