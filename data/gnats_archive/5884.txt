>Organization:

>Environment:
Linux 2.2.13 (Slackware 7)
egcs 2.91.66
>Description:
We use custom error document 404
We use PHP3, PHP4 and HTSH (experimental PHP like program), configured
	as CGI with mod_action (*.php,*.php4,*.htm,*.htsh and many more)
1. When you request non existing document, it works (*.txt for example)
2. When you request non existing document that are configured for mod_action it run action interpretator and do not show any error.
	the second (2) repeat , if we remove error document...

We have similar configuration on fisicaly diferent server,
but with Apache 1.3.9 (config files are almost the same, except paths),
and it works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.asfa.net/any_broken_url.php   <- PHP3
http://www.asfa.net/any_broken_url.php4  <- PHP4
http://www.asfa.net/any_broken_url.htm   <- we use PHP3 over html
http://www.asfa.net/any_broken_url.htsh  <- this is PHP-like preprocessor
http://www.asfa.net/any_broken_url.any   <- this is not PHP and will work
>Fix:
mod_actions?
