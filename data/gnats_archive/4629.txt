FORM content supplied in the ACTION statement is not included with the FORM data
on submission.

For Example:

<FORM METHOD=post ACTION="/cgi-bin/foo.pl?name=joe&age=21">
<INPUT TYPE=text NAME=location>
</FORM>

...will return values only for "location" and does not process "name" or "age".

>How-To-Repeat:
Go to http://www.engtools.com/test.html.  This is a form that demonstrates the
problem.

State-Changed-Why:

Are you saying that the QUERY_STRING does not contain
"name=joe&age=21"?  Or that you're expecting them to
appear in the POST message-body?  By the way, method
names *are* case-sensitive, so you should use "METHOD=POST"
rather than "METHOD=post".

State-Changed-Why:

Closed per submitter's request:

QUERY_STRING contains what it is supposed to, and the POST body contains
only the INPUT fields from the form.  From what I can tell, it appears
that the system is operating correctly.  Based on these results, I don't
feel that there is a problem with Apache.

Please close this ticket.  I appreciate the support and thank you for
your time.  Keep up the good work!

Also, thanks for the info on case sensitivity.
