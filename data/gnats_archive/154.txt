>Environment:
AIX 4.1 and Solaris 2.5 with gcc 2.7.3, pdf plugin on mac and win95
>Description:
We have been trying to track down the cause of a mysterious problem with
adobe's pdf viewer plugin on windows and mac. When using apache 1.1.1, a
click on a pdf file loads the pdf, and it displays in the plugin in the browser.

However, when we switch to apache 1.2, using the same config files, the plugin
downloads, but never displays in the viewer. Very odd. If we disable the plugin,
and direct app../pdf to the viewer, it works fine. The only difference I can see 
from the server is the response headers, but I did not think that these headers 
were available to plugins.

Is there any way to have the server pretend http 1.0 for a specific mime type?

I have been lobbying hard that this doesn't seem like a server-caused problem, but
I am not winning, so I was hoping that someone could either back me up or prove me wrong here.

thanks,
-d
>How-To-Repeat:
get the plugin and try it out with a pdf document.
>Fix:
If it is a plugin bug, adobe should be contacted...

Should be fixed in revision 1.98 of http_protocol.c.  It
is a problem with Netscape not supporting the standards.
The patch is available at
