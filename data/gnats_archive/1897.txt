>Environment:
Digital Unix 4.0B (564), standard DEC compiler, flags -fast
>Description:
Using <Location ~> or <LocationMatch> for the following:

  <Location ~ ".*/aft98/auth/.*">  fail to trigger authentication
  <Location ~ ".*/aft98/auth/">    does trigger the authentication prompts

Here is the full section in the access.conf file:

<Location ~ ".*/cyberforum/aft98/auth/.*" >
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Africa Telecom 98 Presenters"
  AuthUserFile /var/www/auth/cfo_aft98
  require valid-user
</Location>

This configuration works correctly on Apache 1.3b2, but fails on 1.3b5...

State-Changed-Why:
Between 1.3b2 and 1.3b5 we switched from using the system supplied
regex library to using the apache supplied regex library on OSF...
Can you try two things please.  The first is to try recompiling
without any optimizations.  The second is to try recompiling with
"Rule WANTHSREGEX=no".

Tell us how it goes, thanks.
