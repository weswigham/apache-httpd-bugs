>Description:
I've been running apache for years then approx 6 months ago when running apache
v1.3.6 I started seeing problems when I tried to add more virtual hosts.  It
seems like the magic number back then was approx 235-237.  Once I added one more
VH the server would start but approx 50% of the accesses would get a server
denied error and in the error log I would see the following messages:

[The date] [error] [client 128.205.251.12] (2)No such
file or directory: file permissions deny server access: /the_path_to_the_file

But the permissions on the files were fine because you could come right back to
the same url and the server would serve the page without a problem.  The files
are .html, .jpg, etc it didn't matter.  Sometimes the server would serve them
and sometimes it wouldn't.  So I figured I'd upgrade to v1.3.12 but the problem
is still there, then I tried v1.3.14 but the problem still exists.  I didn't
upgrade to v1.3.17 since this is a major server on campus and I have to
schedule upgrades like this since we are serving so many VH's.  Anyways, I'm
currently running 232 VH's.  As soon as I add one more I get the problems I
describe above.  But, I've also noticed when I make a change to the httpd.conf
file and then issue a kill -USR1 the above problem starts happening but to a
lessor degree.  Instead of %50 of the accesses having problems is approx 3-5%.
So what I do is now kill the apache server off totally and restart the server
and the problem goes away.  I now have time to work on this problem again.  I've
searched your bug reports and everything else I know about and can't find any
mention of anything like this, except of the issue of too many error log 
definitions on solaris because they use stdout and you can only have approx
255 file handles open when using that.  So a long time ago I removed separate
error logs for all the VH's and I have them all log to the same file.  In all
the VH 's definitions I don't specify the same file, I just specify the error
file in the main server section so they pick up the same file by default.  All
the other hosts do have a different access log but that should be OK to my
knowledge.  I have unlimited shell limits on the main apache process so that
should pass those to all the children it creates.

I tried to replicate this problem by starting a test server on the same machine
with all these VH's but I can't replicate the problem.  It seems like it only
happens on a very busy server which this host is.  It's our main webserver.

So I was wondering if you can give me any help in debugging why this problem
is happening since we need to add more VH's to this server and we currently
can't.
>How-To-Repeat:
I can only repeat it by how I said above.
>Fix:
Nope.  I ran out of idea's so that's why I'm coming to you guys.

Thanks for using Apache!

   We can't run mod_vhost_alias since all of our virtual hosts are very
 distinct per department so every Virtual host definition is not similar
 enough to use this functionality.
 
   I thought I would be able to have upto 1024 file descriptors, since solaris
 allows this max and I have the following in the script that starts the apache
 server:
 
 unlimit cputime
 unlimit filesize
 unlimit datasize
 limit stacksize 2090000
 limit coredumpsize 20480
 unlimit vmemoryuse
 limit descriptors 1024
 
 Also, your answer doesn't explain why I can't use kill -USR1 anymore to
 have the server reread the config file.
 
 Thanks for you time in this matter,
   Lenny

Comment-Added:
The FAQ entry links to http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/descriptors.html which has a more detailed description.  Compiling using a 64-bit ABI may get around this particular problem of yours if your system supports it.  This is a Solaris limitation.
