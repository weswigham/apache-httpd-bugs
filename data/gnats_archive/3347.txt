>Description:
When using the <virtualhost> tag there seems to be a parsing of reserved words going on.
Note: I have a lot of virtualhosts with the same format as below that work correctly.

I had the line <VirtualHost rfif.mot.com> and then the rest of the block and it would 
not do the redirect, even though it was exactly the same as all the others, with the
difference of then name rfif.mot.com

So I tried putting the ip in place of the DNS name and it worked.  Seems to me that 
for some reason, even though it is clearly inside of a tag, that apache rewrite is 
parsing the if and therefore not doing the redirect.


>How-To-Repeat:
Add the following to http.conf
<VirtualHost rfif.apache.org>
 ServerName rfif.apache.org
 Redirect / http://www.apache.org
</VirtualHost>
>Fix:
add a line that turns off reserved word once inside of the tag.

State-Changed-Why:

Apart from "_default_" Apache does not try to parse
any special words in the VirtualHost argument.

Are you sure that this is no DNS problem?
A DNS lookup on rfif.mot.com fails for me.
