Red Hat Linux release 5.0 (Hurricane)
Kernel 2.0.32 on an i586
>Description:
this.request = aRequest;
this.response = aResponse;
this.session = request.getSession(false);
if (session == null) {
   this.session = request.getSession(true);
   trace("New session " + session.getId());
}

The code above always creates a new session.  
The same servlet runs fine on servletrunner and JRun on WinNT.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.gathering.org/tg99 uses the servlet, 
but I can't see how you can see what is wrong.
>Fix:
I was using JServ 0.9.11.  Maybe that is the problem?  We have downloaded 1.0b2 and configured, run make, and make install.  
However mod_jserv.c is on the list of compiled-in modules, so maybe we have to recompile Apache?

 yes you need to re-compile Apache.
