State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your report.  Luckily this has been fixed in CVS
and will be resolved as of the next release of apache 1.3.x.

In the mean time, you may wish to apply a local patch (such as checking p for n
on-NULL before dereferencing) like you suggested in your report.

Thanks for using Apache!
