SunOS 5.4 Generic_101945-46 sun4m sparc
gcc 2.7.2.2
>Description:
The beta 11 compiled OK, but in starting httpd I got the error that there
was a bad regexp in httpd.conf, with the offending line being
	BrowserMatch Mozilla/2 nokeepalive
I went back to beta 10, and it also compiled fine, and with the same
configuration files it started without this error.
