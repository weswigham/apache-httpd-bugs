uname -a == "SunOS goat 5.6 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc"
>Description:
My Solaris box (goat) is using multiple IP addresses with the same physical
ethernet interface. Routes have been deleted such that all outgoing requests
go through the main interface (goat.heurikon.com).

Apache is configured with multiple virtual hosts, each with its own IP address.
The machine's main IP is configured to be a proxy server on port 8080. Other
virtual hosts include www.johnstewart.com and www.coldboot.com, each with its
own IP.

When using the Apache proxy to other web servers, they correctly see
goat.heurikon.com as the source address. However, when accessing another one
of the virtual servers on the same machine, it will sometimes correctly
see it as coming from goat.heurikon.com and sometimes from the hostname 
corresponding to the virtual server you are accessing. As an example, here
is the log corresponding to a two loads of www.coldboot.com:

www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:53:55 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 304 -
www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:53:56 -0500] "GET /top.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:53:56 -0500] "GET /bottom.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:53:57 -0500] "GET /menu.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
goat.heurikon.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:53:57 -0500] "GET /main.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:53:57 -0500] "GET /pics/back.gif HTTP/1.0" 304 -

www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:54:09 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 304 -
www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:54:10 -0500] "GET /top.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
goat.heurikon.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:54:10 -0500] "GET /bottom.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:54:11 -0500] "GET /menu.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -
goat.heurikon.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:54:11 -0500] "GET /pics/back.gif HTTP/1.0" 304 -
www.coldboot.com - - [28/Jul/1998:14:54:11 -0500] "GET /main.html HTTP/1.0" 304 -

The client was the same machine, using goat.heurikon.com as the proxy server.

I wouldn't have noticed this problem if /server-status hadn't been restricted
to heurikon.com and I tried loading it from one of the other virtual servers.
It is usually denied, sometimes nore. Seems to be about a 1 to 4 ratio. I was
unable to ascertain a pattern.

I can provide further information on request - I'd be glad to provide my config
files if that will help!

State-Changed-Why:
This is related completely to your OS; Apache does not
specify any source address for the connections, but lets
 the OS pick the one it wants to.  That is the correct thing
for Apache to do.

It is not unexpected that when connecting to another interface
on the same machine the OS should pick that address as the
source.  There have been some issues with Solaris 2.6 and
picking which address to use, and I think there is a ndd
setting that can tune it, but I'm not sure what it is offhand.

Maybe ip_enable_group_ifs, and there may be a patch or two
related to it.  2.6 attempts to "load balance" traffic
to interfaces on the same subnet by randomly picking a source
address.

 I appreciate your response, and this is not a critical problem, but with all 
 due respect, I believe you are wrong. This is an Apache/Solaris issue, not a 
 Solaris issue alone.
 
 As I mentioned in my bug report, no other process uses any of these 
 interfaces, including the SOCKs proxy I have on the machine, and any other 
 network client. Additionally, the Apache proxy server itself *does not* 
 exhibit this behavior when accessing web servers on other machines. It is only 
 when accessing another virtual interface on the Apache process that this 
 happens.
 
 Also, the routes out the other interfaces do not exist. Here is my ifconfig -a:
 
 # ifconfig -a
 lo0: flags=849<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 8232
         inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000 
 elx0: flags=863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 204.95.85.90 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 204.95.85.255
         ether 0:60:8:2b:21:1b 
 elx0:1: flags=863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 204.95.85.91 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 204.95.85.255
 elx0:2: flags=863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 204.95.85.92 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 204.95.85.255
 elx0:3: flags=863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 204.95.85.93 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 204.95.85.255
 elx0:4: flags=863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 204.95.85.89 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 204.95.85.255
 
 And here is my netstat -r:
 
 # netstat -r
 
 Routing Table:
   Destination           Gateway           Flags  Ref   Use   Interface
 -------------------- -------------------- ----- ----- ------ ---------
 204.95.85.0          goat.heurikon.com     U        2     67  elx0
 default              cisco1.heurikon.com   UG       0  14671  
 localhost.heurikon.com localhost.heurikon.com  UH       0      2  lo0
 
 As far as outgoing packets are concerned, those interfaces aren't used at all 
 by Solaris (as I've said, this is true for all processes other than Apache).
 
 As for the ip_enable_group_ifs option for /dev/ip, it was on. I set it to 0, 
 and then the behavior worsened. According to the access log of the virtual 
 server (www.johnstewart.com) I was trying to load, the proxy requests looked 
 like they came from www.johnstewart.com instead of goat.heurikon.com. They 
 should have all looked like goat.heurikon.com (at least it was previously 
 intermittently correct).
 
 Moreover, even with the ip_enable_group_ifs feature disabled, accessing 
 external web servers exhibits the correct behavior. The proxy server sends 
 requests out the goat.heurikon.com interface.
 
 This is definitely not just a Solaris issue, but one exhibited by Apache alone 
 under Solaris. Further, it is only an issue going to a different virtual 
 server using the proxy server. As I've said, all other network processes are 
 working correctly.
 
 If this problem is not fixed, it is not a big deal. It's more a curiousity 
 than a real issue. However, please do not close the case as it is, in my 
 opinion, clearly a reproducible bug.
 
 thanks
