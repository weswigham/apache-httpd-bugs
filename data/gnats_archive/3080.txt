Linux Slakware, 2.0.35, i486, gcc 2.7.2.2, glibc 5.4
>Description:
When the extra cC flag -DHTTP_ROOT is defined in src/Configuration
the process of compiling stops at http_core.c : 271 with the error message
"parse errer after '/' " The HTTP_ROOT was defined as /var/lib/http, what should
not be harmful. Starting the httpd executable with -d works fine, though.

State-Changed-Why:

It sounds as though you're defining it as

  -DHTTP_ROOT=/var/lib/http

which isn't valid.  It needs to be a string, so use

  -DHTTP_ROOT=\"/var/lib/http\"

to get the quotation marks into the compiler.
Thanks for using Apache!
