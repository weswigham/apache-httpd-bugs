>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, gcc
>Description:
within src/Configure an awk expression is formed from the modules list
to include all static modules into the MODULES= definition of the Makefile

src/Configure:1932
$CAT > $awkfile <<EOF1
    BEGIN {
      split ("$AUTODIRS", tmp, " ")

The formed line from $AUTODIRS is just to long for Solaris' awk version

This results into a malformed Makefile (missing MODULES= definition line)
so that configure reports that gcc is not an ANSI compiler due to 
failed tests. A similar problem might have caused PR#4960.

>How-To-Repeat:
Configure Apache with as much modules (e.g. modules-directories)
as possible; here the problem occured with:

split (" modules/experimental modules/standard modules/extra modules/proxy 
modules/example modules/ssl modules/auth_mysql modules/zmod
modules/perl modules/php3", tmp, " ")
>Fix:
list each modules directory as a string itself,
