>Description:
During my testing I also got:

[Sun Feb  9 11:53:55 1997] accept: Too many levels of remote in path
[Sun Feb  9 11:53:55 1997] - socket error: accept failed

...and then the server didn't like answering any more connections.  Even a
HUP didn't restart it.  I _know_ I have seen reports of this before, but
can't find it anywhere in the mailing list archives.  Anyone else remember
this?

State-Changed-Why:
Well, we haven't had huge numbers of reports of this
being a problem and it hasn't happened lately, so I will
chack it up to either not having all the wonderful Solaris
patches installed or some transitory problem with the code...
