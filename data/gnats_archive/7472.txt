Attempt to access http://twin.inet/ everything is OK.
Attempt to access http://twin.inet/doc/ - Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /doc/ on this server.

If I rename symlink `doc' to anything else everything works
mv /home/httpd/html/doc /home/httpd/html/Documentation (or /home/httpd/html/aaa)
and the server allows access.

No, this server is in my private network not connected to the internet.

State-Changed-From-To: open-feedback
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Wed Mar 28 15:45:08 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

It seems very likely that this is some kind of configuration
problem either in httpd.conf or in your unix permissions.

Does the error log contain any useful information?
Can you get this problem to repeat consistently?
