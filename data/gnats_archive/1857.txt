>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 (Service PACK 3) and Apache's win32 binary distribution
>Description:
I am having a problem with my PHP running under an Apache service on NT.
 I ran the server and few hours later I noticed that I php.exe doesn't
 work anymore. I get the message

 "[Sun Feb 22 20:51:41 1998] [error] (24)Too many open files: couldn't spawn
 child process: c:/inetpub/wwwroot/cgi-bin/php.exe"  in the Apache's log.

 I have a PHP3 type action in the apache config file   whicn fires the CGI PHP.EXE 
whenever a .php extension is encountered.

I contact the PHP mailing list and they think it's an Apache Problem. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Run a PHP script every 10 seconds and you're bound to hit this problem!
>Fix:
I tried doing special prayers and that didn't seem to fix it! :%2
