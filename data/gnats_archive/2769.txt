State-Changed-When: Mon Aug  3 10:54:32 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
What do you mean it "doesn't work"?

Is access allowed without authentication?

Is access always rejected?  If so, with what message?

Does anything show up in the error log.

"doesn't work" is almost never a useful description of the
problem.

 I forget to change the path in the .htaccess file to
 the new apache path "/usr/local/apache" so now I'm
 able to login but no I get a browser error

 This is completely a configuration error and it means that you don't have
 the file setup to be trated as a CGI.  As described in the docs,
 you need either a ScriptAlias or need to setup the directory
 with Options ExecCGI, AddHandler, etc. to execute files with
 certain extensions.

 I already have it setup in the "access.conf" file.
 
 <Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/data/>
 AllowOverride All
 Options FollowSymlinks ExecCGI Indexes
 </Directory>

 That is not sufficient.
 
 As I said, you also need to tell it to run .cgi files as CGIs.
 
 See http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ#CGIoutsideScriptAlias for details.
