>Description:
I cannot seem to get "Range" header to work. I am using same headers as in the
example in PR#1329. Using your server www.apache.org to test, I always get the
entire document. I also have same results on a version 1.2b7 server. Example:

Telnet to www.apache.org port 80, then:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.apache.org
Range: bytes=0-100

The entire document is returned.

Now my actual problem:
---------------------
The same problem happens making a 1.0 request. This "hybrid" request works
fine on Microsoft and Netscape servers. I'm fairly certain it worked on at least
one of your Beta versions about a year ago...I'm sure I tested it (using
your server). Example:

GET / HTTP/1.0
Range: bytes=0-100

Again, the entire document is returned from your Apache server, version 1.3b3dev
and v1.2b7.

State-Changed-When: Thu Dec  4 15:43:11 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Some documents, such as files parsed for SSIs by
mod_include, can not be served in ranges.  The files
at http://www.apache.org/ are such files, so the
entire file is returned.
