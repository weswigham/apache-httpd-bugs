>Description:
Got complaints from a user who can't acces our server , but doesnt't get any 
messages on his browser. Whenever he tries to access, there occurs a line in the
error_log which sais:
socket error: accept failed
This is all, there is no IP-number or any name of the sender.
This problem must be situated in the server itself, because the request shows up
in the firewall documentation how any other request. He even gets three packages
back, but that's it.
So we're afraid that more users might have this problem and we have no idea why
and how to fix it. Further, the same user who complained reported that he did
browse on our server some weeks ago without any problems.

Apart from that, we have quite a lot of error messages in the error_log which say:
access to /usr/local/etc failed for ..... reason: file doesn't exist
I don't know if this is severe, but I wonder why some keep trying to access this
file ..?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help !

State-Changed-Why:

You mention that you use Apache 1.05 which is an ancient
version. I'm afraid we cannot support such an outdated
version of Apache any longer.

Please upgrade to a recent version (eg. Apache 1.2.4)
which likely will solve your problems.
