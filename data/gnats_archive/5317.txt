>Description:
If I use default httpd.conf without <Directory /> having "deny from all",
once I visit http://host/~user (the user exists on the server but has no
public_html) the server says "404 Not Found".
That's correct, OK, but if I follow the security advices, using <Directory
/> "deny from all" with <Directory /home/.+/public_html> "allow from all",
I visit the same place above (and the user's situation is the same) and
get "403 Forbidden".

Is it strange? It should also be "not found", right?
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow the steps above.
>Fix:
no.
