>Description:
If the user directory permissions are to restrictive to allow the apache user access to the "public_html" directory, once fixed apache must be restarted.
>How-To-Repeat:
chmod 700 ~user
attempt to access user dir
chmod 777 ~user
chmod 777 ~user/publich_html
access will still fail
restart and access will be granted

Add this to the documentation of UserDir or timeout the cached results

I think you missed something else here.
This works fine for me without a restart.
Thanks for using Apache.

 I'm VERY careful about these things...
 
 Could there be difference caused by different platforms etc? At the time I
 was using Mandrake 6.1 - I don't have that around any more but I can attempt
 to verify again on my current systems.
 
 Again for clarity, say userdir was:
 
 drwx------ mike
 with or course a "public_html" under it with the same permissions, then the
 first attempt to access would of course be denied.
 
 Changing permissions to:
 drwxr-xr-x mike
 and of course to the sub-dir public_html DID NOT make them immediately
 accessible.
 
 Restarting the server did.
 
 Is there some kind of caching mechanism which would "remember" that the
 directory was unavailable? Or could that have been an OS "feature"?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mitch

 I really can't think of any reason that this would happen.  Perhaps you
 had a badly behaving browser caching the error page?  Apache does
 not do any cacheing unless you are accessing through the proxy module.
 If you can recreate it, I would be interested in the details.
