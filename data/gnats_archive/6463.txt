>Description:
APRVARS.in replaces rather than adds to the value of EXTRA_LIBS, which
breaks constructs like the following in modules' config.m4 files:
	LIBS="$LIBS -lxxx"
such as in modules/file_cache/config.m4 and modules/example/config.m4.
configure line 7689 adds $LIBS to EXTRA_LIBS
configure line 8349 sources lib/apr/APRVARS
APRVARS, constructed from APRVARS.in, assigns a new value to
EXTRA_LIBS, thereby losing the added library (-lxxx).
