>Description:
I added some new mime types in the file mime.types:

application/visio            vsd
application/excel            xls
...

All mime types worked correctly except the one with the xls extension.
The apache server doesn't send the right Content-Type to the browser.
I also tried some other extensions and the result was:
all extensions starting with x and ending with s (e.g. xks xms xas ...) don't
work properly.

I wasn't able to reproduce this problem.  What is the filename
you are having problems with?  Are you running any non-stock modules
or handlers?
