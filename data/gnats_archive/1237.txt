>Description:
NOTE - had posted to the newsgroup, several folks emailed me with very
similar experiences, I have separated below with =====================

ME (jmurtari@thebook.com)
 When submitting CGI forms from some of our PC's, with Netscape browser 3.02Gold we now 
 "ocasionally" note the following:
 1) You fill out the form.
 2) Your press the submit button.
 3) Netscape says "host contacted, waiting for reply..." 
 ----- nothing happens for a few minutes
 4) Netscape appears to time out with "Document Contains no data" 
 ===
 At the same time monitoring the server, there is NO entry
 in the access logs or CGI logs that the script ever was requested 
 or fired.  The Apache-status log does not appear to show any 
 connection open.
    
 NOW...
     
 5) Press the "submit" button again, and everything is fine.
     
 Doesn't always happen this way, sometimes it works first time, 
 sometimes you have to press the submit button a couple of times.

 I've got kind of an interesting situation here.  I've got an internal 
 web site running using Apache 1.2.4, running quite well.  I've tried 
 Netscape Navigator, Netscape Communicator, MS IE, etc.  All of these 
 have worked well on my machine.  I've got 1 user (Navigator 3.03) that 
 fails on 1 particular CGI request.
     
 To wit: he selects a link from the main index.html page, which runs a 
 CGI program.  This program sends back an HTML form, and exits.  It's a 
 simple form, with a SUBMIT button at the bottom.  Usually, when the 
 SUBMIT is hit, the CGI runs again with the forms data, and returns in 
 just a couple of seconds with the generated HTML report.
     
 This user more often than not gets an hourglass, and nothing. 
 Sometimes it works, but usually not.  I've put a sniffer on the 
 network at his machine, and I can see the POST packet leave his 
 machine.  When the request succeeds, I can see  an HTML packet with 
 "Content-type:  application/x-www-form-urlencoded" as the first header 
 and the forms data  go out to the server.  When it fails, the HTML 
 packet with the forms data does not show up.

   I'm starting to experience the same thing.  I'm running BSDI 3.0
with Apache 1.2.4.  The error log is giving me "lingering close
lost connection to client ....".   I've also seen an error somewhere,
but I can't track it down now, about something being wrong with
the post length.  I see this from NetScape 3.03 and I think the
error started only after I installed IE 4.0 (a mistake). =20




>How-To-Repeat:
Apache 1.2.4 on Solaris 2.5.1 X86, talking over a modem link to a
PC running Windows 95, and Netscape 3.02gold. Microsofts TCP /IP stack.

We stopped running 1.2.4 and went back to 1.2b6 (where it seems to occur
much less frequently); however, if you want we can run 1.2.4 and then
we can make it happen from one of our PC's like "clockwork". It will ALWAYS
fail the same way.
>Fix:
If you wish, we can give you a temp login to one of our servers, and we
can make the request so you can monitor. Best time here is between
0800-1200 EST.

State-Changed-Why:
This is probably related to PR#1142 <http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1142>.
It is a browser bug, not an apache bug (I analysed the network
traffic).  The only "workaround" known so far is to disable 
keep-alive... but that's not a good idea in general.

Try disabling keep-alive, see how that affects things.

I'm really busy at the moment, but if you want to collect tcpdumps
I can try to get a chance to look at them.  I'll need full packet
contents... so something like this:

    tcpdump -w dumpfile -s 1514 tcp port 80 and host addr.of.client

run that on the server before the client makes any requests.
Then reproduce the problem with the client (let all timeouts
happen).  Then hit ^C, and gzip the dumpfile... if it's not
too large (i.e. less than 100k) then send it to us in email.
Otherwise stuff it somewhere and send us the URL.

 It's likely worse in 1.2.4 than 1.2b6 because in 1.2b7 or so I overhauled
 Apache's network performance.  The bugs in other browsers show up
 particularly because they "like" webservers to send the headers in one
 packet, and the rest of the data in subsequent packets.  Apache never does
 that deliberately any longer.  Note that even if Apache were changed to
 flush its buffer after the headers it wouldn't guarantee the clients would
 see things nice and rosy like they want -- because TCP gets to make the
 decision about where packet boundaries are.  So these latent bugs in
 browsers have to be fixed anyhow, and I'd rather not back down on this
 performance change. 
 
 The changes were prompted by early versions of the paper
 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Pipeline.html> which showed
 how poor Apache was at stuffing network packets.  We're now pretty close
 to optimal. 
 
 1.3 won't make it any better, although it may change the behaviour a bit. 
 1.3 uses writev() to replace two write()s.

This has been tracked to a bug in navigator which netscape has fixed.
The most recent versions of 3.x and 4.x have the bugfix.
