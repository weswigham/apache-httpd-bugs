>Environment:
FreeBSD 3.0-CURRENT
>Description:
Two problems are here:
1) Characers are not unsigned making all ctype operations with 8bit data
dangerous. For more info see PR#1305
2) FreeBSD already have Henry Spencer regex in libc, so don't need yet one
from apache.

State-Changed-Why:
We know determine if we are FreeBSD 3 or earlier. If v3,
then we add -funsigned-char and use System regex
(fixed in 1.3b6)
