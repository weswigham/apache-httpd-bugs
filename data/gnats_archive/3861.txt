>Description:
While the question is simple, its importance for Y2K certification efforts is
critical. 

The FAQ 'Apache HTTP Server Version 1.3' @ www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html
#62 "Is Apache Year 2000 compliant states "Yes, Apache is Year 2000 compliant.".

Is this statement also applicable to the Apache HTTP Server 1.25? If not, please
advise of corrective methods (e.g. patches?). Is there a reference site which
summarizes a position of Y2K compliance for all Apache HTTP Server versions?

The FAQ is written in such a way that one draw 2 different conclusions:
(1) assume #62 is only applicable to V1.3 since this is the leading header
    of the doucment
(2) assume #62 is applicable to all HTTP Server versions due to the generic
    response/discussion under #62.

Thanks for your time.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Clarify the FAQ on the website re: which releases other than 1.3 are Y2K 
compliant or have a separate URL which summaries Y2K info. Thx.

State-Changed-Why:

Well, the y2k statement in the FAQ applies to Apache
1.2 and 1.3, but there have been some y2k improvements in Apache 1.3
(see http://docs.apache.org/new_features_1_3.html#misc).

You should consider upgrading to a current version of
Apache 1.3.
