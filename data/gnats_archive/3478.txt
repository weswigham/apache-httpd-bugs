>Description:
during testing the apache contributed patch
http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/patches/1.3/macaddr.patch
we discovered the following bug:

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Solution:
replace in section:

*** 291,296 ****
--- 359,406 ----
...
+       for(s = 0; s < 5; s++)
+               if(*ptr++ != *mac++)
+                       return 0;
+ /*
+ **    A hit!
+ */
...

by 

...
+       for(s = 0; s < 6; s++)
+               if(*ptr++ != *mac++)
+                       return 0;
+ /*
+ **    A hit!
+ */
...

(s < 5 changed to s < 6 in loop)
("for"-loop now runs from 0 to 5 (= six times))
