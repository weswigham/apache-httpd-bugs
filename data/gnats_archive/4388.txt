>Description:
Many people link to our site and forget the "#" for jumping to the appropriate
entry on a page. E.g. instead of linking to /DATA/Seminars/99/#99421 they link
to /DATA/Seminars/99/99421. Due to having more than one path where this happens
(for every year since 1990 at least three occurences) I want and because of 
Redirect matches only complete paths and not parts of directory names (see 
beyond and RTFM to Redirect) I'm forced to use RedirectMatch instead of 
Redirect. So I wrote:

RedirectMatch permanent ^/DATA/Seminars/([0-9][0-9])/([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]?)(\.html|/.*)?$	http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/DATA/Seminars/$1/#$2

If I now request http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/DATA/Seminars/99/99421 I get 
redirected to http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/DATA/Seminars/99/%2399421 instead of 
http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/DATA/Seminars/99/#99421 because RedirectMatch
quoted the "#" and returned it as "%23".

In comparision

Redirect permanent /99/99 http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/DATA/Seminars/99/#99

redirects http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/99/99 to 
http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/DATA/Seminars/99/#99 as it should. Unfortunately
redirect matches no path components, e.g. it matches /99/99 but not /99/99421,
so I am forced to use RedirectMatch...

BTW: This seems to be similar to #4379 and #3333, which both have the same 
problem with quoted question marks. Mainly I wrote this bug report, because I 
fear that, if that both bugs are fixed and only the "?" won't be quoted anymore,
the same problem with quoted hashes may resist.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/DATA/Seminars/99/99421
>Fix:
Don't let RedirectMatch quote hashes and question marks. AFAIK there shouldn't
be any other exceptions.
