>Description:
Some operating systems append password rules (expiration, last time of change)
within the password field, so that the field contains 2 bytes salt, 11 bytes 
password, a comma, and some (2-4 in my case) rules bytes.

ap_validate_password in src/ap/ap_checkpass.c won't validate a password in 
this case.

Further warning from the man page:
 WARNINGS
      The return value for crypt() points to static data whose content is
      overwritten by each call.  crypt(), setkey(), and encrypt() are unsafe
      in multi-thread applications.  crypt_r(), setkey_r(), and encrypt_r()
      are MT-Safe and should be used instead.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a module that uses a password or NIS services on a machine that supports
password rules.
>Fix:
Change the (almost) last line in ap_checkpass.c from:
return (strcmp(sample, hash) == 0) ? NULL : "password mismatch";
To:
return (strncmp(sample, hash, strlen(sample)) == 0) ? NULL : "password mismatch";
Or:
return (strncmp(sample, hash, 13) == 0) ? NULL : "password mismatch";

crypt seems to return a non-null string if hash is non-null.
