State-Changed-Why:

This is a pretty vague problem description.  It could be
caused by any number of different problems.  I suggest
that you go to one of the newsgroups listed in the FAQ
and ask this question, providing a little more detail
about what is going on.

One thing you can try is to lower the setting of
MaxRequestsPerChild.

Thanks for using Apache!

Subject: os-linux/7409: Not releasing Cache memory in Apache HTTP version 1.3.12
Date: Fri, 16 Mar 2001 16:19:13 +0600 (IST)

 I am running Apache server 1.3.12 on Red hat Linux 6.2, the system RAM i 
 640 MB. The config settings are Keep Alive =15, Min Spare servers=5, Max 
 Spare server=10, Max clients =30. The number of hits are around 9000 
 during peak two hours. Most of the RAM is shown as Cache, with servers 
 reaching Max Client, the response becomes slow and system memory has 
 almost has no free RAM. Please suggest the solution. 
 Regards
 Rakesh
