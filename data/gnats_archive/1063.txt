 Then it is probably a gcc installation problem, and we can't really help
 with that.  It is a problem with the system header files that gcc can't
 parse.  It compiles fine using gcc 2.7.2.2.f.2 on: 
 
 HP-UX hinton B.10.20 A 9000/777 2009667036 two-user license
 
 for me.

 Not really.  You don't want to be messing around with your system header
 files; it probably isn't a problem with them, but a problem with the
 manner in which gcc was compiled and installed.
 
 The only thing I could suggest would be adding a
 
 	typedef int blkcnt_t;
 
 to the HPUX section of conf.h.  If that doesn't work, there isn't much
 we could do.  You could try installing a newer version of gcc, being
 sure to follow every step of the instructions closely.

 Hi Marc,
 
     This is a huge known problem with the gcc compiler binary
 distribution on HP-UX 10.20.  The binary distribution is for 10.10 and
 doesn't work correctly on 10.20.  It can be fixed by re-building the
 compiler from the source.  
 
 BTW: This isn't anything apache specific, it happens with *any* program
 that includes <sys/stat.h>
