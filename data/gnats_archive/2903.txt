>Description:
i noticed report #2742 is similar to this problem..
i've been using 1.3.1 since the 12th with no problems.. the account that i run
apache from has a 20meg quota enforced.. i accidentally exceeded that tonight
and apache crashed with "[emerg] (28)No space left on device: could not call
shmget".. i freed up space and raised the quota, and other programs that run
as this user don't have any problems writing to the disk.. apache still thinks
there's no space left for it.. i can't reboot the machine apache runs on right
and was wondering how this problem can be fixed, for future knowledge..
>How-To-Repeat:
setup a quota for the user apache runs as, and exceed the hard limit while
apache is running.. worked for me.. =)

State-Changed-Why:

If this recurs, try gracefully restarting the server after
fixing the space problem.  If the server still complains
after a graceful restart, reply to this message so we can
re-open the report.
