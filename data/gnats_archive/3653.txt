Win95a, Apache 1.3.4 binary 
>Description:
Many directives do not allow comments after the directive and arguments, eg:
    ScriptAlias /*/cgi-bin/ "C:/home/*/public_html/cgi-bin/"     # comment here

This applies to at least the following which all gave errors:
    listen, bindaddress, loadmodule, serveradmin, servername, options, 
    allowoverride, loglevel, customlog, scriptalias, </directory>, readmename, 
    headername, sethandler, order, </location>, namevirtualhost, documentroot, 
    scriptalias, </virtualhost>, etc., etc.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

'ExtendedStatus on' directive gets:

Syntax error on line 97 of c:/internet/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'ExtendedStatus', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not
 included in the server configuration

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This message always occurs on restarting the server after ^C shutdown in the console 
box (does not occur with apache -k shutdown method).

C:\INTERNET\APACHE\APACHE.EXE: [Wed Jan 13 03:21:58 1999] [warn] pid file c:/int
ernet/apache/logs/httpd.pid overwritten -- Unclean shutdown of previous Apache r
un?
Apache/1.3.4 (Win32) running...
>How-To-Repeat:
Self explantory.
>Fix:
Scan all directives for comments before parsing (if they can't contain a #).
If they can contain a #, then it gets more complicated.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Jan 13 09:10:17 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Comments are not allowed to appear on the same line as
directives.  The comment must be the only thing on the line.
This is on purpose and will not be changed with the current
config language.

As for the "overwrote pid file" message: shutdown Apache
properly.  ^C isn't properly.
