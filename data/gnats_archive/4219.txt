This is in reference to my previous report about configure not telling me
anything.
So I've figured out that the "/path/to/apache/installation"
is the output apxs -q PREFIX, which is

> echo `apxs -q PREFIX`
/usr

Fine, so I guess giving --with-apache-dir doesn't help.

Here is the output of make:

gback@peerless [72](/opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3) > make

And that's it.


>How-To-Repeat:
Simply configure and make, like so
./configure --with-jsdk=...
make
>Fix:
No, I don't.  Probably an automake problem.
I guess now I'll have to dig through Makefiles, then Makefile.ins, then
Makefile.am to figure out why it isn't doing anything...
Isn't automake great?

  I assume that replying to this confirmation mail will update my
 bug report.  Well, I've figured out why make isn't doing anything.
 
 Here's the relevant parts from the Makefile created by 
 automake/autoconf/configure:
 
 ...
 #lib_LTLIBRARIES = libjserv.la
 ...
 LTLIBRARIES =  $(lib_LTLIBRARIES)
 ...
 all: Makefile $(LTLIBRARIES)
 
 
 No wonder it doesn't do anything.
 
 I must say I find it somewhat sad that I, wanting to play with JServ,
 have to debug automake related stuff now.
 
 Funny enough, this seems to happen in all projects using automake that
 I've had contact with.  I guess that restrict the circle of suspects to
 two: me and automake.  I really wish people would stop using it.
 
 Cheers,

 Aha.  Further investigation reveals that it's not automake that is to
 blame per se, automake in its infinite wisdom only hides what's going on.
 
 Apparently, you need to specify --with-apache-src, because of
 AM_CONDITIONAL(MAKE_LIBJSERV, test x$apache_dir_is_src = xfalse)
 in configure.in
 
 The question boils down to what is an "apache src" directory.
 Why should you need the Apache source to build mod_jserv?
 I see no reason; I can see that you need the include files, which
 RedHat puts in /usr/include/apache.
 
 I'd suggest you either rename
 --with-apache-src to --with-apache-include or point out that all you
 need is the header files.  (If that's indeed true, and I'm not simply
 trying to achieve the impossible when attempting to build JServ without
 having built apache).
 
 Secondly, you may want to consider printing a warning if MAKE_LIBJSERV
 is false, because that basically means that you don't build the main
 component of your distribution; something you may want to tell the user
 about.
 
 
 I'm feeling kind of bad of putting my fudging with this in a bug report;
 it's rather a testimonial of how automake and using its features can totally
 obscure and screw up what would otherwise be a straightforward build process.
 
 I know that the include files are in /usr/include/apache,
 and indeed I see:
 > echo `apxs -q INCLUDEDIR`
 /usr/include/apache
 
 (That's a test configure does too)
 So I try:
 
 ./configure --with-jsdk=/x/gback/classes/jsdk.jar --prefix=/opt/local --with-apa
 che-dir=/usr --with-apache-src=/usr
 
 checking for httpd.h... no
 configure: error: Could not locate one or more of the necessary Apache header fi
 les.
 
 
 Then I try:
 
 ./configure --with-jsdk=/x/gback/classes/jsdk.jar --prefix=/opt/local --with-apa
 che-dir=/usr --with-apache-src=/usr/local
 ing for httpd.h... no
 configure: error: Could not locate one or more of the necessary Apache header fi
 les.
 
 Hmmm, maybe:
 ./configure --with-jsdk=/x/gback/classes/jsdk.jar --prefix=/opt/local --with-apa
 che-dir=/usr --with-apache-src=/usr/local/apache
 
 checking for Apache directory... configure: error: Directory  is not a valid Apa
 che source distribution
 
 Hmmm, I guess it's back to studying the configure/configure.in file
 some more... 
 
 Cheers,

 Hmmm, but your doc at
 http://java.apache.org/jserv/install/howto.unix_install.html
 says that I only have to give --with-apache-src for a static compile,
 which is not what I want to do.
 Then why this test in configure.in?
 
 How do I get this thing to build as a DSO?

  I again fell victim to this time not automake, but autoconf
 (and my own stupidity).  It's not --with-apache-dir, it's --with-apache-install.
 Of course, configure never complains if you specify an option that doesn't
 exist.  It's like it doesn't care.
 
 With --with-apache-install, Apache configures successfully, even without giving
 --with-apache-src.  Now I'm even more confused: how did
 MAKE_LIBJSERV get set?  I thought it required $apache_dir_is_src to be
 true... but wait, let's look at it again:
 
 AM_CONDITIONAL(MAKE_LIBJSERV, test x$apache_dir_is_src = xfalse)
 
 This probably means: set MAKE_LIBJSERV to true *unless* apache_dir_is_src
 is set to false (in which case it wouldn't make sense...)  
 Then it would make more sense.
 
 So, I guess this leave only two problems on your end of things:
 First, the problem with configuring outside the srcdir, and second the
 problem with configure not reporting what is going wrong.
 
 Thanks,

 Now that I was finally able to run the sample servlet, here's
 a bit more feedback you may or may not find useful:
 
 First I should mention that I'm using Kaffe as my JVM.
 Therefore,
 wrapper.classpath=@JDK_CLASSES@
 
 produced this
 wrapper.classpath=
 
 (I assume because I didn't define JDK_HOME?) 
 which in turn made JServ crash like so.
 [11/04/1999 23:46:22:246] (EMERGENCY) Error initializing protocols
 [11/04/1999 23:48:54:736] (ERROR) wrapper: file /opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3/example/jserv.properties (line 53) wrapper.classpath must be called with a parameter
 [11/04/1999 23:48:54:737] (ERROR) an error returned initializing protocol "wrapper"
 [11/04/1999 23:48:54:737] (ERROR) in init all protocols "wrapper" returned an error
 [11/04/1999 23:48:54:737] (EMERGENCY) Error initializing protocols
 
 You may be able to fix this with something like
 @HAVE_JDK_CLASSES@wrapper.classpath=@JDK_CLASSES@
 and set HAVE_JDK_CLASSES accordingly.
 
 Secondly, in examples/jserv.conf.in, this line is wrong:
 
 @LOAD_OR_NOT@LoadModule jserv_module libexec/mod_jserv.so
 
 It does not take the $prefix and $exec_prefix variables into
 account.  After make install, mod_jserv.so ended up in 
 $prefix/lib/mod_jserv.so for me.  Note that I specified an alternate
 location with --prefix when configuring.
 Unfortunately, I don't know how to fix this easily.
