In a <VirtualHost> section I'd like to be able to use multiple ServerAlias
lines to avoid long configuration lines. However, only 2 ServerAlias lines seem
to be accepted. Specifying many aliases in a single ServerAlias directive works
OK though.

 Only 1 ServerAlias directive works.  I'm not sure what you're seeing to
 make you think that 2 work, but they certainly don't.  The ServerAlias
 directive just overwrites whatever value it previously have.

 Looking back it appears that I also counted the named defined with
 ServerName...

 Does this mean that multiple ServerAlias statements may be possible in
 future releases? This would be help to avoid long config lines for servers
 with multiple names (eg. www.sub.dom, www, intranet.sub.dom & intranet).

This was fixed by Dean Gaudet as part of the 1.165 patch of
http_core.c on March 2, 1998. It was shipped as part of the
