Hi,
There is a problem with the apache server.

A url with any blanks is cuted when the server find the 1 first blank:

e.g.  http://192.168.0.2/Michael Jackson/Michael Jackson.html

the server read and stop at : http://192.168.0.2/Michael 

With others servers I have not this problem.
What is your solution?
            
            Best Regards.

State-Changed-Why:

Unencoded spaces are not permitted in URLs.  Allowing URLs with spaces would cause serious problems in HTTP.  Some browsers may clean these up for you before sending (by hex-encoding them), but in general, you should not expect
them to work.

Thanks for using Apache!
