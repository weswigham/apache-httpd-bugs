I'll explain by example, it's easier.

Say I've got four variants:
page.de.html
page.de.pdf
page.en.html
page.en.pdf

My browser is set to prefer html over pdf's, and the accept-language only contains 'en'.  If I request 'page' or 'page.en' I get page.en.html, just as I should.  But if I request 'page.de' I get a '406 Not acceptable' error.  I know my accept-language should really contain a 'de' if I want to read German, but if I just want to show an example German page to an English browser, it's rather unrealistic to ask people to alter their browser settings.

If I request 'page.de.html' then I get the page fine, since no negotiation takes place because I've explicity said which file I want.  But in my example I've already explicity said which language I want -- can't mod_negotiation take the lead from there, and just perform the negotiation between .html and .pdf?

It's especially a problem for me since I provide sites in lesser-used and minority languages, so the correct language codes are hardly ever present in the user's browser's Accept-Language.

At the moment I've got an ErrorDocument pointing to a perl script which reads the Accept string, works out the correct variant to send, then forces a redirect using the full file name.  Not the best solution, I'm sure...
>How-To-Repeat:
See example above
>Fix:
Portions of the filename that have been specifically included in the request shouldn't be taken into account when negotiating.
