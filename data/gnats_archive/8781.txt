SuSE Linux 7.2, Kernel 2.4.0, gcc 2.95.2. mod_ssl 2.8.5.
>Description:
When a CGI script is requested, and the request URI has a query part, and the filename in the request is subject to content type negotiation, then the query part of the request URI does not appear in the QUERY_STRING variable in the CGI environment variable. This occurs in requests that are negotiated by option MultiViews. 

Thus:

  GET /getenv.cgi?hello -> QUERY_STRING=hello
  GET /getenv?hello     -> QUERY_STRING=

This behavior is different from apache 1.3.14, which is the previous release that I used.
>How-To-Repeat:
This problem occurs with a minimal server configuration such as this: 

  Options MultiViews ExecCGI
  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

and can easiliy be ssen in a trivial CGI shell script that just returns the envrionment.
>Fix:
The following line in mod_negotiation.c seems to be responsible for erasing args in request_rec that later ends up in QUERY_STRING. It was no present in apache 1.3.14.

Possibly sub_req was not set up to contain the original query.
