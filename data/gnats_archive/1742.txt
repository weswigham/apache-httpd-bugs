State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended
State-Changed-By: brian
State-Changed-When: Wed May 20 03:04:09 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
(suspended is the right state for this, as Dean looked at
it and said while it's not 100% correct, it's not a big
thing to worry about)

State-Changed-From-To: suspended-closed
State-Changed-By: fielding
State-Changed-When: Fri Jul 30 20:42:07 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:

The code is 100% correct, regardless.

>Unformatted:
RFC2068 section 10.3.5 states:

   The response MUST include the following header fields:

  o  Date

  o  ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in
     a 200 response to the same request

  o  Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
     differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant

   If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section
   13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers.
   Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the
   response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents
   inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.

So yeah I suppose we should at least deal with these headers.  But these
headers tend to be controlled elsewhere in the server usually...  so I
really don't consider it to be a large issue.
