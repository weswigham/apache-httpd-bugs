>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.2.5 RELEASE, GCC 2.7.2.2, but this bug is
not related to any particular software
>Description:
Assume, we have following setup:

AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
ProxyPass /somedir  http://otherserver/somedir2

In this case, request to /somedir/file.html will be redirected
to http://otherserver/somedir2/file.html, but request to
/somedir/file.shtml will be handled locally (by server-parsed handler
in present case). I think, this behavior is not correct	
>How-To-Repeat:
Add two lines from my sample setup to your httpd.conf
>Fix:
The problem is produced by mod_proxy and mod_mime interferention
I.e. proxy_trans() function sets request handler to 'proxy-server',
which is correct. Later (on type-checking stage) find_ct() (from
mod_proxy) tries to find handler for this type. If this check fails,
original handler (proxy-server) will restores, but if such handler
exists then it becomes 'The Only' handler.

I'm not an Apache architect, so I cannot propose how to fix this
behavior by right way

State-Changed-Why:

This bug is already fixed in the current source tree.
1.3b4 and later versions will include this fix.
As a workaround for 1.2.x you may use something like this
(untested):

 <Location /xyz/*.shtml>
 SetHandler proxy-server
 </Location>
