WinNT 4.0 (SP2)
Apache 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 precompiled win32 binaries
>Description:
Pipeing transfer or error-logs to a program doesn't work.
When I put for example this command to httpd.conf
-- httpd.conf--
TransferLog "|c:/ohjelmat/apache/eatlog.exe"
---end---
I got this error message and Apache exits on startup

ap_spawn_child: Bad file descriptor
Couldn't fork child for piped log process

I get the same error-message even if the program is nonexistent
or real.

If i use pipes on ErrorLog, I get no error message, but Apache
will not start.
>How-To-Repeat:
This problem repeats on every startup if transferlog or errorlog
tries to pipe output.

State-Changed-By: stoddard
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 31 08:30:12 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Apache on WIN32 does not support piped logs. I hope to get this into Apache 2.0.

State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 16 19:36:07 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Piped logs will be supported under Win32 in the forthcoming
version 1.3.13 of Apache.
Reliable piped logs will (hopefully) get into Apache 2.0.
