State-Changed-Why:
You really need to be more specific than "cause errors".
What sort of error?  Exactly what happens when you try
to download it?  What do you think should happen?

Please provide a sample URL if possible so we can see what
content-type is being sent.

 Hey Marc, thanks for the swift reply. Let me attempt to better define the
 problem. Microsoft Excel spreadsheets have the .xls extension.  When
 attempting to view from MS IE or Netscape the  file mime type is received
 from apache as text/plain. When loaded from a file it is received as mime
 type: application/x-msexcel. I have attached 3 bitmap files to further
 clarify what's happening. Please feel free to call me at 216-896-2826 if
 you wish. Again thanks for your help, we love the apache browser.

 What I really need is an example URL for a xls file on your server.
 
 What do you have in your mime.types file for xls?  Have you restarted your
 server after adding it.

 I had assumed that based on your original message you had already tried
 adding it to the mime types file.  
 
 On the server you need to either edit your mime.types file to have some
 mime type for xls files or use something like "AddType
 application/x-ms-excel .xls" to your config files and restart the server.

 Hey again, I have incorporated:     application/x-msexcel  xls    into the
 "mime.types" file on the server...... No Good
 Next I added     AddType  application/x-msexcel   xls       into the
 "srm.conf" on the server.
 I stopped and restarted the httpd daemons. No luck.
 I also tried AddType   application/x-ms-excel   .xls     No Good
 Is there any means of tracing what's going on?
