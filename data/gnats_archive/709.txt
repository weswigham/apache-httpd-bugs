>Description:
Hi,
I have Apache HTTP Server downloaded and running, I think.
I succeeded in getting my ISDN TA (NEC PCIT55D1) working and connecting to my ISP, manually. Next, I have to automate the dial-in. It looks a little tricky according to some documentation that I have been reading.

I now have a problem accessing the www from a browser located on a pc connected via my intranet to the proxy server machine.

I have installed the proxy server on a Linux PC with an ISDN TA and ethernet card having an internal IP address of 201.50.1.75, netmask 255.255.255.0. My ppp connection to the ISP appears in the routing table upon connect with two entries, one for the actaul connection between the linux pc and the ISP and the other serving as a default route.
I used:
pppd -d -detach defaultroute /dev/modem & when initiating the ppp daemon.

So, my ppp connection gets dynamically assigned a valid internet IP address (or virtaul one) - it seems that my ISP is also using a LINUX proxy server! 

I have initiated my proxy server (with port 1080 specified in /conf/httpd.conf) as follows:
/usr/local/etc/apache/apache_1.2.0/src/httpd -f /usr/local/etc/apache/apache_1.2.0/conf/httpd.conf

When I do this, the cursor disappears and after approx. 3 secs. the screen returns to normal input mode. When I examine the running processes with 'ps', the proxy server doesn't appear as a process. Is this normal?

On my client side, I have set the client up with an IP address of 201.50.1.72, netmask 255.255.255.0 and gateway address of 201.50.1.75 (my Linux machine). I have defined all these settings in the TCP/IP section of network settings in the Control Panel of the client pc (NT 3.51). In Netscape, I have configured the client for manual Proxy Connection under Preferences/Advanced/Proxies (Netscape v4.0 Beta5) specifying 201.50.1.75:1080 as the proxy server address.

In the browser, when I try to access, for example, 

http://www.netscape.com

I get the following message:

'Host contacted.Waiting for reply...'

and the browser remains waiting until a timeout occurs.

Would it be conceivable that the proxy server isn't actually running at all and that when I try to access the netscape homepage, I can contact it because of the ppp connection but cant receive data from the netscape server because I dont have a valid Internet IP address i.e. the proxy server is not hiding the browser pc from the rest of the world at all.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Yours sincerely,
Colm.

This configuration question would be much better answered by
the folks on the linux-net@vger.rutgers.edu mailing list, or
in a linux specific support newsgroup.

Thanks for using Apache!
