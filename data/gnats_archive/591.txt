>Description:
wondering if there was a fix concerning "Older" browsers attempting to 
to connect to virutal hosts. ie Netscape 1.0. is it a problem w/ the browser, 
or the server. it appears (to me) that netscape 1.0 requests pages via IP rather 
than name.. if i'm wrong, and there is a way around this, i'd Love to know it.

State-Changed-Why:
'Host:' header (ie. non-IP) based virtual hosting will not
work with older browsers because they don't support it.
This is documented.  The only real workaround is to put
up a default page that lets people with older clients
pick what site they wanted, but that is something of
an ugly hack.

It is a limitation in the older HTTP protocol; there is
nothing Apache can do to avoid it.
