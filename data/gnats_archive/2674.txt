>Environment:
NetBSD 1.2 i386
>Description:
The Configuration*-files are referencing htdocs/manual/sharedobjects.html,
which does not exist.  I believe the correct file to reference is
htdocs/manual/dso.html.
>How-To-Repeat:
# pwd
/usr/local/src/apache_1.3.1
# grep "sharedobjects.html" src/*
src/Configuration:# "htdocs/manual/sharedobjects.html", under 
src/Configuration.apaci:# "htdocs/manual/sharedobjects.html", under 
src/Configuration.tmpl:# "htdocs/manual/sharedobjects.html", under 
# ls htdocs/manual/sharedobjects.html
ls: htdocs/manual/sharedobjects.html: No such file or directory
# ls htdocs/manual/dso.html
htdocs/manual/dso.html
#
>Fix:
replace-string ("sharedobjects.html" "dso.html")
