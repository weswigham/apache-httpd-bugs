Linux 2.0.32, Mod_Jserv 0.9.11
>Description:
This is a Simple servlet that displays some HTML and and IP address of the machine caling the servlet.  When this servlet is included in a page with the <servlet> tag pair, the rest of the HTML on the .jhtml page does not display in the browser.

Here is the HTML for the URL Below:

<html>
<head>
<title>Java Servlet SSI Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial">Java Servlet Server Side Include Example Page</font>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/alug.jpg" alt="alug.jpg (5955 bytes)" align="middle"></h2>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">This example file includes an additional tag
&lt;servlet&gt;&lt;/servlet&gt;.&nbsp; The Apache Web server is configured to re
cognize the .jhtml extension, and will perform a Server Side Include on the page if the special &lt;servlet&gt; tag is in the web page when it is served to the user.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial">Here is the SSI</font></strong></p>
<servlet code="TestWebServlet.class">
</servlet>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Here's some more HTML after the servlet.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</body>
</html>
>How-To-Repeat:
SSI = http://alug.adg.org/servlet_ssi_example_page.jhtml
Servlet only = http://alug.adg.org/servlets/TestWebServlet

State-Changed-Why:
Technically, this is not a bug in JServ but in the servlet,
which is closing the output stream.  Unfortunately, this
is the behavior suggested by Sun's tutorial.

A better approach is to flush the outputstream/printwriter
when the servlet finishes.  Using this approach will avoid
this problem.

For convience, a future version of JServ may also include
code which will allow servlets to "close" the
outputstream/printwriter without causing problems.
