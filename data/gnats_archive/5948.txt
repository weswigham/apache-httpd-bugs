>Description:

I'm trying to redirect all URL's under a certain domain to a script using 
RedirectMatch.

However, I want any URL's beginning with /wss/ to be ignored so that they
can be processed by an Alias statement.

Two problems have arisen

1) the substitution process for one of my two RedirectMatch statements works,
but URL encodes the ? symbol I'm using to pass parameters to the script.
Consequently, the script isn't invoked.  Is it possible to correct this
undocumented behaviour?

2) with my second RedirectMatch I use a regexp ^/(.*!wss/) which is meant
to match any URL except those beginning with wss/
The redirect never matches though - either there is something wrong with
my regexp or Apache can't cope with this particular regexp.

Have you tried using mod_rewrite instead?
