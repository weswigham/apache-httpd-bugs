>Description:
"Allow from" directive in httpd.conf does not support multiple variant
notations, NOR does it support multiple CIDR notations in the same statement.

Specifically, if I have a config such as:

--snip--
Allow from 10.0.0.0/8, 199.245.173.0/24
--snip--

Apache will DIE with reason:

Syntax error on line xx of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
syntax error in mask portion of network/netmask    

Obviously this is an incorect error message.  There is nothing wrong with the
CIDR notation: Apache just did not interpret/parse it correctly.

Similar invalid notations:

- Mixing CIDR and hostnames.

Specifically:

--snip--
Allow from 10.0.0.0/8, some.other.hostname
--snip--

.. this will refuse some.other.hostname with an error message in error_log
stating "[client ip.add.re.ss] client denied by server configuration: $CONFIG"

The only solution was to break each notation into individual allow from's:

--snip--
Allow from 10.0.0.0/8
Allow from 199.245.173.0/24
Allow from some.other.hostname, *.hostname.com   <- this works!
--snip--

Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
Two courses of action:

1) (Less optimal) Note in documentation somewhere that you can't do it
2) (Best) analyze and fix parsing of config..

State-Changed-When: Mon Nov  6 10:28:13 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:
The syntax of the allow directive is _NOT_ "allow foo, bar"
but rather "allow foo bar".  So when you starting putting
commas in there, of course it won't behave properly since
the list is supposed to be space separated.
