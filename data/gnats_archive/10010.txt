./configure --enable-mods-shared=all --enable-proxy --enable-proxy-http

>Description:

With the configuration described below, when the backend server knows 
HTTP/1.1 (such as apache), every second request in an HTTP/1.1 chain
fails with "proxy: error reading status line from remote server" in 
error_log and the corresponding 502 response from the proxy.

This does NOT happen if the server closes the connection after each
request, and can also be avoided by adding this to the proxy config:

SetEnvIf Host "." nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

(I assume because in either case mod_proxy has to request each
document separately instead of on a HTTP/1.1 chain)
>How-To-Repeat:
All modules are shared, I am using highperformance.conf plus:

LoadModule setenvif_module modules/mod_setenvif.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so

<VirtualHost _default_:888>
   ProxyPreserveHost On
   ProxyPass / http://otherserver/
</VirtualHost>
>Fix:
No, but it has something to do with reading the content from the
previous request, perhaps something is left in the buffer. It does 
not happen when the first request is a HEAD, for example.
HEAD HEAD HEAD works
HEAD GET HEAD fails
GET HEAD fails
