State-Changed-From-To: open-feedback
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 11 10:52:22 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
What _exact_ directives are you using?  Add-Handler doesn't
exist as a directive.  It is critical that you are exact
about what you are using, as "minor" typos can cause major
differences.

Where do you have your Options directive?  Does it apply
to the directory in question?  Are you sure there is no
more specific one overriding it?

If the above doesn't solve it, please send a copy of your
config files.  This is almost certainly a configuration
error.
State-Changed-From-To: feedback-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 20 00:06:53 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
User reports problem solved.

The reason why an Options directive in a VirtualHost section
alone doesn't work is because the other Options directives
you have in other Directory sections are more specific.

 Hi,

 Sorry was a typo ... had to be AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

 First made my changes in the VirtualHost section
 Options +Includes
 
 that one does not work.
 After adding this option into the access.conf for explicitly this directory
 everything works fine...
 
 can't i place this Options setting into my virtualhost part ?
