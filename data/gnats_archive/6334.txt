>Description:
I'm working with php.  When I restart apache with apachectl and then in
my .php file call phpinfo() it gives a lot of information about the apache
server, including the environment variables.  All of my environment variables
have been inherited by the apache server, and are there for the world to see,
or at least people doing php work on this machine.  Security-wise this is
probably not a good idea.  The only way to give apache a clean environment
is to reboot the machine, which is a nuisance.  There ought to be a way in
apachectl to clear all of the invoker's environment variables; not sure if
that should be the default behavior or an option.
