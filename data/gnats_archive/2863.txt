>Description:
We use automounted NFS home areas mounted as /home/*. We added the following  automount entry to allow another department ( with a legacy configuration ) to participate in our NIS domain.

auto.home
---------

* &:/export/home

Which automatically allows any host with an exported /export/home to be accessed as /home/hostname.

In our configuration files we have

srm.conf
----------
AccessFileName .htaccess
UserDir web-docs

access.conf
-----------

<Directory /home/*>
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

Despite this setting the httpd trys to stat /home/.htacccess which causes the automounter to try and find an NFS share .htaccess:/export/home and flags an error. This happens at the rate of about 1 per second.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put in the specified automount entry.
>Fix:
If AllowOverride None is set don't even look for AccessFileName

State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 18 12:35:57 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
It does not look for htaccess files if AllowOverride None
is set, however you are only setting it for /home/* and
not /home.
