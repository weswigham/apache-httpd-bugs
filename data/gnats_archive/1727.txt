IRIX 5.3 11091812 IP22 mips Challenger S server, apache 1.3b3 compiled with 
the IRIX cc. The server runs in a chrooted environment.
>Description:
I tried to upgrade one of our web-servers from 1.2.5 to 1.3b3. The server
runs in a chrooted environment. But when I started the 1.3b3 server it gave
me these messages in the error_log:

accept_mutex_on: Permission denied
accept_mutex_on: Permission denied
accept_mutex_on: Permission denied

accept_mutex_on: Permission denied
accept_mutex_on: Permission denied
accept_mutex_on: Permission denied

And so on forever...

I suspected this had something to do with the various ways to do
accept serialization code, so I recompiled with -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
(which is used with the 1.2.5 version), and the new version has worked fine 
(so far). But isn't this a suboptimal solution? My server don't have multiple 
processors, so USE_USLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is probably not a good idea. But
will USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT be faster than USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT?

I suspect that my problem with USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is due to 
the absence of some important system files in my chrootet environment, but
so far I have not found any helpful hints in any of the logs, or in any
of the man-pages I've been through (semop, semctl, semget, intro). 

Could you possibly give me some hints on where to look? If you need to know
more about my chroot-setup I'll be happy to provide all the details.

 You should probably ask in an irix specific newsgroup to find out what
 magic file you need... some of us use irix but we don't really have irix
 gurus.  If you find out please tell us!

 It is faster, but I normally wouldn't worry about it unless you get a lot
 of traffic.

 Try copying the whole /dev directory to the chrooted environment then if
 it works removing things until it breaks.

State-Changed-Why:
Problem is caused by user running apache in chroot() environment.
There is likely a device or other system file that needs to be
created in the chroot() environment.  No solution yet.

State-Changed-Why:
Er, we're hoping the user will figure out what files need to
be copied into the chroot environ since we generally don't
have access to irix systems.
