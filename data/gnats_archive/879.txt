AIX 4.1 Patch level (4.1.5).
gcc 2.7.2 (-O2)
>Description:
The document manual/misc/descriptors.html says this about AIX:

AIX version ?? 
      AIX appears to have a hard limit of 128 descriptors. End of story. 

I'm currently running 620 virtual web servers on AIX 4.1.5 so this is
abviously wrong. I have checked the headers files and the hard limit 
should be 2000. The hard limit for AIX 3.2 might be 128.


>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache 1.2.1 on AIX 4.1 and add a whole wack of virtaul web
servers.
>Fix:
Change the documentation. :-%2
