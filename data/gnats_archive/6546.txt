>Description:
My C module registers as module::post_read_request
(all other module:: fields are NULL)

It is designed to sometimes processes the request completely (DONE) and
sometimes defer completely to Apache (DECLINE)

When it processes: the user only sees
the output if there is more than 4096 bytes of it
(including headers)
otherwise Apache outputs nothing!
>How-To-Repeat:
write a module that just registers through module::post_read_request
(all other module:: fields should be NULL)
post_read_request should ap_rwrite() a short message e.g. "Testing"
then return DONE

now try and see that message from a browser - it isn't there!

grow the test message to 4K and suddenly you can see it from the browser!
>Fix:
Is it related to buffering?
src/main/buff.c:#define DEFAULT_BUFSIZE (4096)

My current work around is to register the module at module::translate_handler
instead. This is later than I need - but it fixes the problem.
