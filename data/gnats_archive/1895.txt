>Description:
Is it possible to have execute CGI scripts on a directory that requires 
user authentication? I have done both separately on two different 
directories and it works well but then I combined the settings onto one
.htaccess on a new directory, I'd get a server error.

I'd appreciate it if you can help me out on this.

State-Changed-Why:
Yup it's possible... but you're using an old server version which
we don't support any longer.  Please upgrade to 1.2.5 and try again.
It's likely that this is just a configuration problem, and so it'd
be better if you asked for help in one of the newsgroups.

Thanks
