all the kids die writing to the log file when it reaches 2gb
this is because the kids are getting SIGXFSZ and default action is to die.

one pertentent point was this was a 
  TransferLog /www/logs/xxx.log
entry inside a <VirtualHost>

in the end caused my machine to crash quite quickly, but that is not really
because of apache.

make a big log file and log to it.

force a rotate?

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 10 18:36:08 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Apache can not "force a rotate" since it is up to the admin to configure how and when they want logs rotated.  It is also not the case that all systems have such 2 gig file size limits. And Apache can not magically reopen logfiles without a server restart due to the server architecture.

It is really up to the admin to make sure that they have some type of log rotation in place so that log files don't get too big.  There is no "proper" way Apache can handle this condition; it is a fatal error on the part of the admin to let a logfile hit  maximum filesize limit...

 G'Day Marc,
 	No worries, and I agree it's mostly an admin problem, 
 but perhaps the a good addition is to catch sigfilesz and
 write a warning, but don't exit the child, at least the machine
 wouldn't trash so much under this condition (we currently would fill
 the log file to 2gig in 3-5 days, so it perceivable that this could
 happen in less than one day).
 
 [I was suprised that r/h had the 2gig limit...]
 
 thanks,
 
 cameron
