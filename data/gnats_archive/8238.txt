>Description:
This code in mod_userdir.c, starting on line 172, checks to see if the path is absolute,
and complains if it is not (and it is not a URL).  This is fine under most
conditions, but when there are quotes around the configuration value (because
it contains spaces), the call to ap_os_is_path_absolute returns FALSE, because
it looks at the initial '"' character, producing an erroneous configuration
error.

        if (!ap_os_is_path_absolute(arg) && !strchr(arg, ':'))
#if defined(WIN32) || defined(NETWARE)
            return "UserDir must specify an absolute redirect or absolute "
                   "file path";
#else
            if (strchr(arg, '*'))
                 return "UserDir cannot specify a both a relative path and "
                        "'*' substitution";
#endif

The relevant line of configuration looks like this (cleansed slightly for 
obsecurity)

    UserDir "/path/to/windoze/mount/*/My Documents/webpage"

and the resulting configuration error (produced by the very code pasted above)
is

UserDir cannot specify a both a relative path and '*' substitution
>How-To-Repeat:
Put quotes around an absolute-path argument to UserDir.
>Fix:
I got my Apache working by removing the snippet of code reproduced above.  A
more robust solution would be to do the unquoting earlier in set_user_dir (I
believe it's currently handled by ap_getword_conf called from translate_userdir;
perhaps set_user_dir could use a similar function?).
