Timeout always 300 s with a timeout value superior to 300s, example (1200s)
The message of the Internet Explorer 4.0 is "the delay of the operation is expired"
The timeout default value of 300 seconds is the value max ?????
>How-To-Repeat:
Change the default timeout value by another superior value like 1200 (file httpd.conf)

no

State-Changed-Why:
We have no control over IE's timeout.  If it decides to timeout,
then it will timeout.  You really should design your applications
in such a way that they don't depend on a web browser
sitting around for 5 minutes waiting for a response.
