>Environment:
Windows NT 4.00.1381
>Description:
I did not had 32-bit CGI program at hand to test, so it may be true 
for them too. 
May be related only to some particular
environment/configuration on Windows NT.
Right after server started CGI programs run, but add memory used
(probably by a child process, it grows with each use). Eventually 
memory usage grows to limits when it became impossible to spawn 
child process.
>How-To-Repeat:
Place DOS based CGI program (I used one compiler with old Turbo C 2.0)
on the server. Open Task Manager and go to processes. You'll see
one apache.exe using about 50K. Browse to CGI program, you will
see new Apache.exe which will become fatter and fatter with each
CGI call. Soon server will start to respond "Server configuration error..."
with a notice in job log:
"[Tue Jun 22 11:32:44 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 
(2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: 
c:/apache/cgi-bin/cech.exe"
>Fix:
No yet...

State-Changed-Why:
There are known problems with 16-bit CGIs in Apache that will be 
fixed in 1.3.7. Losing memory is not one of the problems we've seen, though.
Can you verify that the system is -really- running out of memory?
How large has apache.exe grown when you see the failure?

In my testing, I observe that apache.exe grows with each request 
until all the threads have been disatched at least once then the process
size stabilizes. Maybe this is what you are seeing.
