>Environment:
any
>Description:
If you #define DEBUG_CGI, you'll get an undefined symbol, because the
declaration for the variable 'nph' was removed in 1.3.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try compiling with #define DEBUG_CGI.
>Fix:
In this code:

#ifdef DEBUG_CGI
    fprintf(dbg, "Attempting to exec %s as %sCGI child (argv0 = %s)\n",
            r->filename, nph ? "NPH " : "", argv0);
#endif

change "nph" to "cld->nph".
