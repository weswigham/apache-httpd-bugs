SCO Unix 2.1 
Apache 1.1.3
Gnu compiler 
Netscape 3.o browser
>Description:
We are running a Tcl CGI that will generate a simple table based report.
The report is always generated successfully when the CGI is called from the submitting forrm. However, when the re-load/refresh button is hit multiple times it will cause the server to hang. The browser seems to behave normally, prompting for a re-post of the form data used by the CGI. However the server hangs with the following error in the erro_log file :

[Fri Feb 21 16:15:12 1997] accept: Protocol error
[Fri Feb 21 16:15:12 1997] - socket error: accept failed


When I do a truss -p on the different server http processes running, they are all sleeping. The output from the truss is:

 truss -p 8876
fcntl(5, F_SETLKW, 0x08064390)  (sleeping...)

The root process seems to be hung in a loop. The same truss command on the root process returns the following continually until the process is killed:

    Received signal #14, SIGALRM, in wait() [caught]
wait()                                          Err#4  EINTR
setcontext(0x0806836C)
lseek(6, 0, 0)                                  = 0
read(6, "06 p\0\001\0\0\0AC "\0\0".., 1200)     = 1200
getcontext(0x0806836C)
signal(SIGALRM, 0x0804B860)                     = SIG_DFL
alarm(1)


The browser will eventually time-out the request, but we have to kill and re-start the server so that we can once again contact the site.

>How-To-Repeat:
I would suggest writing a simple tcl CGI that generates a form from post data, and hitting the re-load command multiple times until it hangs. If you fail to reproduce it I may be able to send you some scripts that will.
>Fix:
Not a clue

 Can you try a recent snapshot from
 
 	http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/
 
 to see if it is fixed in recent 1.2 source?  There have been numerous
 changes in this area which may have fixed this.  If not, I have heard of
 this happening enough on various systems to try to track and fix it but it
 makes no sense to work from the 1.1 code.
 
 Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
The probability of a fix for Apache 1.1 is fairly low.
Would you please try to reproduce this using the latest
1.2 beta (1.2b8)?  There is a reasonable chance that this
issue has already been fixed.
