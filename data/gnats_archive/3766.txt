IRIX64 sgi11 6.5 07271714 IP27

the char* of conn_rec.remote_addr gets presented as 255.255.255.255 and I
suspect it could presents its self else where in str comparison

there are several instances of this problem in the os-irix postings
>Fix:
The bug is in Irix inet_ntoa (), i fixed this by writing my own inet_ntoa ()

also submitted a bug report to SGI (:P)
