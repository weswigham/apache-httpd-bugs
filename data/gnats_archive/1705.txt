REMOTE_USER Environment Variable not created since r->connection->user is NULL

Any suggestions.

I have checked the FAQs and the Problem Database.  There are similar problems.
However, Authentication is occuring in my case.  I have validated the username
was passed to the web server, interpreted and returned in the Authentication 
Cookie for use in subsequent web server requests by placing trace statements
within the authenticate_basic_user and add_common_vars modules.

Any Suggestions are appreciated.

 I think you'll have to be a lot more specific, such as giving a sample URL
 of a CGI, and username/password that shows this problem.  Because I've
 never had this problem.

 I am sorry it has take so long to get back to you.  I appreciate the
 response very much.  In summary, to your query.  The exact URL, CGI,
 username/password is of no consiquence.  The basic authentication code
 segment is dropping the information.  I am guessing based upon your response
 someone here has hacked-up the code.  My next step is to download a clean
 version and perform a diff to 
 confirm or deny this assumption.  I will get back to you once I have
 completed this task with the results.  THANK YOU AGAIN.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem is also likely to occur if you're using cgis with
paths like /cgi-bin/foo.  If you do that, and you haven't put
an authentication requirement on /cgi-bin/ then REMOTE_USER
won't be set.  See the FAQ for more details.

Is this the case?

 The cgi exists within a directory requiring authentication.
 
 I have been able to interegate the Security Cookie to gain access
 to the username as a work around.  When I get some time, I will 
 do the download.  I really think one on the system guys here
 messed up the code.  Please close the problem report and I'll
 respond when I'm able to do the file compair.  
 
 See Ya!!!! 
 
 :)
