>Environment:
SunOS ultra2 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
the query string sent to the cgi program is corruptted in some cases, eg:

http://host/cgi.pl?fcat=電子郵件&ftitle=pega

but the cgi.pl will get 'fcat=電子郵' only, and the other parts are gone

the problem didn't exist on the linux 2.2.27
>How-To-Repeat:
try:

  http://ultra2.pchome.com.tw/cgi-bin/sansil/dbshow.pl?fcat=電子郵件收發軟體&&&

  or

  http://ultra2.pchome.com.tw/cgi-bin/sansil/dbshow.pl?fcat=Windows+螢幕保護程式&&&

  you will get a error message, that means the query string passed to cgi is wrong!
>Fix:
I don't know, but 1.2.0 have the same problem
so I suspect this will be a OS dependent problem(?)

-> should I change all the query into plain 7-bit? is this a restriction for cgi
   or not? please reply if possible

thanks for the help%2

State-Changed-Why:
This appears to be a Solaris problem; there is another PR
in the database about it somewhere.  In the past, it has
magically gone away by compiling with a different compiler
or different optimization level.

I will try to take a further look at it sometime, however
doubt it is an Apache problem.  The only OS I have seen it
on is Solaris.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem appears to be fixed somehow in the 1.3b3-dev
source tree; I see the problem on Solaris with 1.2.4 but
can't reproduce it with 1.3b3-dev.

In any case, technically such characters should be %
encoded.

Thanks for the report.
