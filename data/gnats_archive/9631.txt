>Description:
I have a servlet that returns some text. The servlet works fine
each time Apache is restarted but after the first time, I find a NULL
character at the end of the text. I have appended some test code below
and shows the results after invoking it:

import java.io.* ;
import javax.servlet.* ;
import javax.servlet.http.* ;

public class test extends HttpServlet
{
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException    {
       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter() ;
       response.setContentType("text/html");

       out.write("<html><head>Test</head><body>Body here</body></html>");
       out.close();
   }

    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
        doGet(request, response) ;
    }

    public String getServletInfo() {
       return "Just a test" ;
    }
}

The first time I invoke it I correctly get (exclude the double-quotes)
"<html><head>Test</head><body>Body here</body></html>\r\n"

But subsequently I get:
"<html><head>Test</head><body>Body here</body></html>\r\n0\r\n"

There is an extra NULL character (0) and a CR LF at the end. This
problem does not happen when the same servlet is run on TomCat and
I get the extra characters when I run any servlets (like IsITWorking
for instance). Once I restart Apache it works fine the first time and 
after that I get the extra characters all over again.

>How-To-Repeat:
The Apache/JServ install came out of the box from Sun. Guess
compiling and running on a Sun Solaris 8 machine will show the
problem.
>Fix:
Get rid of the extra characters.

 I added a response.setContentLength() to the code and after adding this, I =
 do not
 see the extra characters anymore.
