>Description:
Hello,

I cannot start the HTTP server if my system is not connected at the network (TokenRing or Ethernet). The server dumps in the routine "ap_get_local_host" (file src/main/util.c, at the statement "if (p->h_addr_list[0]), line 2051", due to the test of the hostent structure. The pointer to hostent structure seems to points to NULL. My network is up and running (localhost, 127.0.0.1).
>How-To-Repeat:
See full description.
>Fix:
Perhaps a more robust checking of an invalid pointer. At least for the structure hostent in the appropriate modul.
