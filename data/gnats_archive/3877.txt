Dear Support,

I'm having exactly the same problem as in bug report 2530. 
After somebody changed the file access_log the httpd is not writing logs to this
file anymore. error_log is fine. I recreated access_log and restarted the daemon
several times. Permissions are OK. There is no error message in /var/adm/messages.

Regards

Jan

State-Changed-Why:

If you move/rename the access_log Apache still logs to
this file. If you change the file in any other way
you have to restart Apache. This will reopen the logfile.

Please upgrade to a current version of Apache.
