>Description:
after upgrading from 1.2.4, i suddenly find many lines of this:

[error] (22)Invalid argument: getsockname

in the error log, about one every 30 seconds.  this machine is heavily
loaded... 100 hits/sec, constantly.

the man page for getsockname doesn't even list 22 (EINVAL) as a possible
return code.

 Wild guess:  this happens when the socket is closed by the client between
 the accept() and the getsockname().  Marc can probably verify this ... 
 he's the freebsd guy.  If this is the case it's nothing to worry about.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure no getsockname errors occured with 1.2.x servers?

I can't see any reason why the socket would become invalid due to
something apache does.

Maybe 1.3 is tickling a kernel bug.
