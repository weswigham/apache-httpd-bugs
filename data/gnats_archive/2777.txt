Apache 1.3.1

>Description:

When running Apache 1.3.1, I get the following error message:

[Tue Aug  4 07:28:31 1998] [warn] (24)Too many open files: unable to open a file
 descriptor above 15, you may need to increase the number of descriptors
fopen: Too many open files
httpd: could not open error log file /var/log/httpd/city.palmdale.ca.us/error_lo
g.

I do not get this error message when using Apache 1.2.4 with the same configuration files
on the same server.  I've seen other reports of this on Usenet under Solaris.

I've done all the checking I can do, and everything I look at claims that the per-process
file descriptor limit is 128.  I have about 150 virutal hosts under the configuration.

Any help would be appreciated.

Patrick

This happens during start-up.  If you would like access to our server, we can make arrangements.

Sorry...  The only thing I can think of is either getrlimit or setrlimit aren't work as expected.

 It looks as though Configure thinks BSDI doesn't have setrlimit, so this
 function isn't called in ap_init_virtual_host.  This may also be a problem
 with Solaris.
 
 It would also seem that Configure for Apache 1.2.4 thinks BSDI has
 setrlimit, which is why running out of file handles is not a problem
 under that version.
 
 I will post another entry as soon as I've confirmed the above.

 I believe 1.3.1 configuration has broke the setting of HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H.
 
 What is this code in ap_config_auto.h supposed to do:
 
 /* check: #include <sys/resource.h> */
 #ifdef HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H
 #undef HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H
 #endif
 
 
 If it's defined, undef it?  What the heck for?

 That is automatically generated at config time; what you see is what is
 generated if it isn't found.
 
 The code is in Configure that uses helpers/TestCompile header.  
 
 However, the whole concept of that may well be broken because it is too
 dumb to properly include other headers that may be required.  Your
 sys/resource.h may require unistd.h or something.
 
 Yea, ok, that is the problem.  I'll see about it.

 That's the ticket.  On BSDI, and probably other systems, sys/resource.h
 requires time.h.
 
 I'm making the changes here to get it working on my end.
 
 Thank you for the help.

State-Changed-When: Thu Sep 17 01:20:15 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The automatic header check was now replaced
by a more correct approach which is safe against
inter-header dependencies. It'll be available
with Apache 1.3.2 the next days. Thanks for your
feedback.
