>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 SP5
>Description:
When downloading a large file from another computer on the LAN from Apache 1.3.6 for Win32 it only seems to send at around 200K/sec. This is not caused by the network because downloading files is as fast as it should be from a Linux Apache server we have on the LAN. Downloads are also shlw even when downloading from the local system the server is running on. This isn't a very big issue for me because my internet connection is only 768kbps.

State-Changed-Why:
This number probably varies greatly depending on the size
of the file you are testing with. The number is meaningless by itself. And it's true, Apache for Windows is not nearly as fast as Apache on the Unix platforms. Working to fix that
in Apache 2.0.
