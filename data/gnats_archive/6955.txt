>Environment:
window NT and window 95; weblogic 4.5.1; jdk1.2.2
>Description:
I am using cocoon version 1.8 with weblogic4.5.1. While there is no problem to run other samples or to display my own xml data using a stylesheet, I just can not run the sample under cocoon-1.8/samples/xsp dir correctly (Not even the simplest xsp sample which does not use taglib at all). No matter I call it directly from browser or click the link from the index.xml screen, I always get an error msg as follows:
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.w3c.dom.Node: method normalize()V not found
	at org.apache.cocoon.processor.xsp.language.java.XSPJavaPreprocessor.process(XSPJavaPreprocessor.java, Compiled Code)
	at org.apache.cocoon.processor.xsp.language.java.XSPJavaPreprocessor.process(XSPJavaPreprocessor.java, Compiled Code)

	at org.apache.cocoon.Engine.handle(Engine.java, Compiled Code)
	at org.apache.cocoon.Cocoon.service(Cocoon.java:167)
..........
Can you tell me what is wrong there?
Thank you!

>How-To-Repeat:
After install cocoon 1.8 into weblogic 4.5.1, and copy the cocoon samples dir into a new 'xml' dir under weblogic's document root (All follow your install instruction), call "http://localhost:7001/xml/samples/xsp/page.xml" from browser or click "First XSP Page" link from http://localhost:7001/xml/samples/index.xml screen.
