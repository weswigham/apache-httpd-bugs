  HPUXEng32RT                   B.11.00        English HP-UX 32-bit Runtime Environment
  B3901BA                       B.11.00        HP C/ANSI C Developer's Bundle for HP-UX 11.00 (S800)
  XSWGR1100                     B.11.00.39     HP-UX Extension Pack, June 1998

>Description:
Compilation is not possible under HP-UX 11.00 with the "-Aa" flag -
use the "-Ae" flag instead.

Binaries aren't possible to run on all HP-UX platforms without compiling
with the "+DAportable" flag.

The first problem is critical, since Apache wouldn't compile without this
change under HP-UX 11.00. (I didn't test it under 10.20)

The second is only critical under the circumstance that the binaries are
compiled on one server and installed on a different server with a different
CPU model.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
change CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE"
to CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Ae +DAportable -D_HPUX_SOURCE"
in line 1376 in src/Configure (Apache 1.3.9)

Note: Fix will not work when using Gnu-C, but the earlier line with "-Aa"
isn't good with gcc either...
