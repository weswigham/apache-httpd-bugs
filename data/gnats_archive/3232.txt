>Environment:
NT4 SP3, running apache 1.3.3
>Description:
With 1.3.2 i got the "missing htaccess file" problem sometimes.
Now with 1.3.3 the problem has moved, or exposed another.
There seems to be a problem determining where path_info starts
when there is a colon in the URL?

I have this URL:
http://localhost:81/cgi-bin/getfile.pl/C%3a/msdev/projects/hello_1.0_43/test_results.html

The error.log says:
[Sun Oct 18 09:40:56 1998] [crit] [client 127.0.0.1] (22)Invalid argument: c:/mda/clt/netobjects/harnesses/cgi-bin/getfile.pl/C:/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

And the browser sees:
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/getfile.pl/C:/msdev/projects/hello_1.0_43/test_results.html on this server.

Apache/1.3.3 Server at 192.168.0.2 Port 81

However, if I use this url:
http://localhost:81/cgi-bin/getfile.pl/msdev/projects/hello_1.0_43/test_results.html

Then everything works fine.

State-Changed-Why:
There was a problem in sub_canonical_filename in which
the terminating null on the filename wasn't always correctly
placed.  The os_canonical_filename processing has changed.
Please try again with the latest CVS or the next release
and report back.

Thanks for using Apache.
