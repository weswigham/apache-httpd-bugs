>Release:        1.3.6 (RedHat Secure Webserver 6.0)
>Environment:
RedHat Linux 6.0, all current errata applied. On Cyrix MII 333.
Compiler is EGCS 1.1.2 I think. Apache is installed from the RedHat Secure 
E-Commerce Edition 6.0 (RedHat Secure Webserver 3.0)
>Description:
MSIE 5.0 Client connected to webserver, and browsed around. A short while 
later I noticed the webserver flooded the network with packets to the MSIE 5.0
client machine. Client is Windows 98, MSIE 5.0 with all current items from
MS Windows Update.

tcpdump reports packets of the following (info in right half columns)
". ack 1 window 32777" comming from the http port on webserver to port 1974 
on client machine.

My guess is that it is requesting the client to resend a packet in the
connection that the client thinks is closed already.
>How-To-Repeat:
User Windows 98 with IE5.0 (client identifer includes DigExt for this particular
user so I don't know where/how user got this copy of IE5.0) and connect to any
RedHat Linux 6.0 Secure E-Commerce Edition machine.

I don't know if this will happen out of the box in either case, and I cannot
duplicate this problem as it has just disappeared.
>Fix:
I have no idea. block MSIE from the server? :P
