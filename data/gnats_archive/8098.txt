MSVC6. Using default configuration.
>Description:
A CGI script containing no linebreaks causes the child process to crash with:

"The exception Priveleged instruction.
(0xc0000096) occurred in the application at location 0x6ff8b901."

This seems to occur regardless of if the sole line is a valid shebang line. The server then restarts, with no mention of the problem in the error log.
