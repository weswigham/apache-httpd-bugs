>Description:
All I ever get is the default icon from my browser when displaying files.
When I attempt to view the specific icon; e.g. folder.gif; I get the
message:

Forbidden
You do not have authorization to access this file from this server.

I have provided a ScriptAlias to my /icons directory:
ScriptAlias /icons/ /etc/httpd/icons

I have provided a Directory directive:

<Directory /icons>
AllowOverride All
order allow,deny
allow from all
Options None
</Directory>

The server runs as user nobody (-1) and group users.
The /icon directory is owned by nobody, group users, as
are all the icon files.

The permissions are 0644 on the icon files.

What am I overlooking/doing wrong?

 Erm... check the docs again.  Directory sections apply to directories on
 the filesystem, not URLs.

 You shouldn't have a /icon directory.  It should be /etc/httpd/icons, in
 your setup, although that is an awfully odd directory structure.  Be sure
 the directory and all directories above it are world readable.

 You are correct, my path is:
 
 /usr/local/etc/httpd/icons
 
 These icons are used when providing a file list to the browser.
 The icons have been added using AddIcon.  The images named appear in
 the browser, but each icon says I don't have permission to access
 those files.  File permissions are correct.  Give it a try with this
 URL:
 
 http://www.ntwrld.com/~jeffl/pixpost/resources/
 
 You'll get a file list.  Try to view an icon and see what you get for
 a message.  I would like for these icons to display.

State-Changed-Why:
You don't want to use ScriptAlias, of course.  You
just want to use Alias.  ScriptAlias makes the server
try and execute as a CGI script everything under that
directory.
