>Environment:
Should be very independent of environment. In this case: SuSE Linux 6.0
>Description:
When I configure jserv like this, it will not work (will not find apache's hsregex.h which is located in apache_1.3.9/src/include/ (part of a Makefile):

               (cd $(JSERV); ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/jserv --with-apache-src=../$(APACHE) --with-JSDK=/usr/lib/java/lib/jsdk.jar --enable-apache-config=no )

But when I do this, it will compile:

                (cd $(JSERV); ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/jserv --with-apache-src=$(PWD)/$(APACHE) --with-JSDK=/usr/lib/java/lib/jsdk.jar --enable-apache-config=no )

Note the difference: $(PWD) instead of ".."

Message form the compiler:

...could not find "hsregex.h". In directory ApacheJServ-1.1b3/src/c apache's include directory is passed as "-I../apache_1.3.9/include" which should be "-I../../../apache_1.3.9/include"..

Did you get me?

Other packages do it right. I don't know how. Take a look.
