Linux 2.0.33
GCC 2.7.21
>Description:
The ScriptAlias directive, when placed inside a <VirtualHost> </VirtualHost> block, is completely ignored.  When accessing CGI-BIN directories on such virtual hosts, the server happily does one of two things: either tells me the file cannot be found, OR it resorts to using the default cgi-bin directory files and executables (defined in srm.conf).

I see NO way to fix this, short of changing web servers (and praying it works).
>How-To-Repeat:
I can't give a FQDN for a URL, but try http://207.213.59.249/cgi-bin/testaxis.pl.  You will find that the file cannot be found.  But the file exists!

In the httpd.conf file, I have the following:

<virtualhost 207.213.59.249>
... other usual stuff for virtual hosts -- this stuff works GREAT! ...
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/<user>/public_html/cgi-bin/
</virtualhost>

And yes, all directories and relavent files exist. :-)
>Fix:
It seems to be a logic problem -- I haven't the time to debug the software at the source code level, as I'm in charge of over 80 virtual domains on my assigned class-C alone, let alone two other class Cs.

Please respond quickly!  Please please please!  :D

Thanks for maintaining Apache -- it's a life saver!

 Upgrade to 1.3b3.  This should be fixed by 1.3b1 actually.

 Yes, I did this, and it works great.  But I'd like it to be posted in the
 bug database anyway, since I didn't already see it there.  (In fact,
 upgrading to 1.3b3 was how I detected the bug to begin with -- all of a
 sudden, people's sites started working again! :D)
 
 Thanks for yoru assistance, and thanks for an excellent web server! :D

 This bug was fixed as part of fixing PR#717.
