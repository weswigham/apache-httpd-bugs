>Environment:
Operating System is Windows NT 4.0(SP-3)
>Description:
I have downloaded Version 1.3.6 of Apache Web Server for Windows NT. I have downloaded the file apache_1_3_6_win32.exe under the binaries directory and installed Apache Web Server.But I am unable to find the file 'httpd.exe' in the src directory.When we clicked on the menu item "Install Apache as Service(NT only)" we are unable to get the Apache Service in the Services menu underneath Control Panel. Please advice at the earliest to overcome this problem.
We have even downloaded the toplevel file 'apache_1_3_6_win32.exe' which is present just above the 'binaries' directory. In either case the problem is the same.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run the apache_1_3_6_win32.exe downloaded from the site www.apache.org underneath the 'Download' link

State-Changed-By: stoddard
State-Changed-When: Wed Dec  1 10:45:24 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
There is no httpd.exe.  During install, you were prompted
for a location to install apache. The default location
is /apache. You will find apache.exe and apachecore.dll (and other files) in the install directory.
