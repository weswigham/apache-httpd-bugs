>Description:
Service cannot start (timeout from service manager) if DocumentRoot points
to g: drive.  Command line apache will work fine.

It works, though, if I move the dir tree from g: drive to f: drive and replace
DocumentRoot "g:/Data/HTTP Root/Port" with
DocumentRoot "f:/Data/HTTP Root/Port"
>How-To-Repeat:
DocumentRoot "g:/Data/HTTP Root/Port"
>Fix:
Don't use g: drive???

 I have identified that the cause of the problem were too restrictive
 permissions on my g: drive.  Once the permissions were relaxed, Apache
 worked as it was supposed to.
 
 The problem of Apache service hanging due to insufficient permissions
 at DocomentRoot, however, is still sever enough to merit a bug report.
