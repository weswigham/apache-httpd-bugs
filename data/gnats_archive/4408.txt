>Description:
When a remote file server goes down (in our case, an afs file server), the web 
server returns a "Forbidden" error, because it can't access a .htaccess file.
Since the error actually returned when attempting to read a .htaccess file is 
"ENODEV", it's possible to modify main/http_config.c to return 
"HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE" instead of "HTTP_FORBIDDEN" in that case.  Could 
this change be incorporated into the distribution?
>How-To-Repeat:
Only happens when a file server is down.  (If I could predict those...)
>Fix:
% diff http_config.c-orig http_config.c
