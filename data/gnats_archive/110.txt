>Description:
I upgraded from Apache 1.2b4 to 1.1.3.
After starting Apache 1.1.3, I received a message that
"ScriptLog" is a unknown directive. mod_cgi was compiled in !
grep -i scriptlog on the source tree of Apache 1.1.3 did not show
a single match, but int he 1.2b4 source tree.

What happend ?

State-Changed-Why:
1.1.3 is older than 1.2b4, and is not really an "upgrade"
That functionality is only in the 1.2 series.
