>Release:        1.3.11
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 sp6a  (Also tried it with Apache 1.3.9 and JServ 1.1b3)  Apache and JServ installed from binary packages.  Sun JDK-1.2-V, native threads.
>Description:
With Apache installed as a service if the Apache service is shut down and then restarted, JServ does not restart.  If Apache is then stopped and started again JServ starts.

apache/logs/error.log is not appended to.
jserv/logs/mod_jserv.log has the following appended:
[26/02/2000 00:21:29:903] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007
[26/02/2000 00:21:29:903] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: connection fail
[26/02/2000 00:21:29:903] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "ajpv12"


java does not appear in the processes list in taskmgr.exe.



>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache from the binary Win32 dist as a service.  Install JServ from the binary Win32 dist.  Load http://your.server.here/servlets/IsItWorking.  Stop Apache from the services manager (Control Panel).  Start Apache.  Try reloading IsItWorking.

Responsible-Changed-Why:

Jserv startup problem... Apache is running and JServ will
not.  Perhaps a service dependency is required here?
