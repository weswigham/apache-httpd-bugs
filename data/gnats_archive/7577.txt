>Description:
If you follow the instructions on ur webiste to cd to the module dir, then say..
apxs -c mod_info.c
apxs -i -a -n info mod_info.so
it does'nt quite work properly.  First of all it will put the loadmodule line in the <ifdefine ssl> section NOT above or below it, which configtest does'nt like.  And secondly it does'nt move the server-info.html file anywhere. so consequently even after you fix httpd.conf foo.com/server-info still returns a 404 error
>How-To-Repeat:
see above please
>Fix:
test for </ifdefine ssl> and then insert AFTER that.  Add cp command for .html
