OS/2 Warp 4, FixPak installed, EMX installed
Watcom C/C++ 10.0
>Description:
I've seen #1316.  I am having that "rush" syndrome, where the server
waits until the script is finished and all the multi-part "rushes"
to the browser.  I use "nph-" as the script name.  I use
"HTTP/1.1 200 OK" to no avail.  I know you say that 1.3 fixes this
but I don't see a 1.3 coming out for OS/2.  Source is at
http://rosariod.mlsinternet.com/nph-gall.cpp

State-Changed-Why:
Actually there is an OS2 port of 1.3b6 alive and kicking.
Check out 

  http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries/os2/

and see if 1.3b6 solves your problems...  whether it does or
does not let us know.
