>Description:
The Code Red worm is obviously quite busy on the net currently, and I'm seeing plenty of it in the log files for our Apache web server.

Usually I would expect those URLs to be logged with a status code of 404. That's also what I've seen in excerpts of logs from other people. But in our logs, I see a status code of mostly status 400 and in perhaps 40% of the cases status 200. Also, I would expect the error log to contain another entry about the requested file not being found, but it doesn't. 

This seems strange to me. I wonder why this is so, and whether this indicates a problem with our server. And whether or not it does, I'm still curious as to the cause of it.

Also, I can't find any difference between the URLs that produce status 200 and those that produce status 400. They're completely identical, as far as I can see in the log.

Okey, I know we're running an old version of Apache. But I tried searching the change log for the 1.3 tree, and didn't find anything about changes to the use of these status codes or the logging of them. Have there been changes that would explain this anyway? I wouldn't want to just upgrade and see the problem just go away without any explanation anyway, especially if it could be security related.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know. When I try to reproduce this manually by calling the server with the same URL that I find in the log, I always get the expected status code 404 and an entry about the requested file in the error log too.

All you have to do though, is connect to the internet and with a while for a real Code Red worm to call you.

Here are two log entries with status code 400 and 200:

61.156.162.2 - - [21/Aug/2001:10:02:31 +0200]
"GET /default.ida?XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

61.170.140.38 - - [21/Aug/2001:10:05:27 +0200]

And I certainly don't have any "default.ida" files.

 I can confirm this. I have seen it too.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... there are a number of reasons for seeing different status codes, especially when using very old versions of Apache like 1.3.6.

Note on the 200 responses, the response length is "-".  This means it timed out before sending the response, due to network issues between the server and client or due to the worm not responding in a timely matter for whatever reason... if you were using a current version of Apache, you would see a timed-out status code there.

As for the 400, there are a variety of reasons why this can happen.  There are a lot of different parts of the request other  than what is logged in the access log... namely, some code red variants send a bogus Host: header.

In short, there really isn't anything to worry about here or any bug in (current versions of!) Apache.
