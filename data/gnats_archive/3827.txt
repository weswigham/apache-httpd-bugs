State-Changed-Why:
It is not clear from your report what you did. To install as a
a service you should go to Start->Programs->Apache Web Server->
Install Apache as a Service. Apache will be installed as a
Service that will Auto start on reboot. To start it after 
installation of the service you will either have to reboot 
or go to Services in the Control Panel, then highlight Apache
and click Start. Please follow this procedure and let us know 
what happens.

 My point is that the contents in the "conf" directory
 were missing, which caused the failure in starting apache.
 Please try to install it by yourself (I assume you didn't,
 or you will see the problem very easily.)

I have successfully installed 1.3.4 on several NT machines
and never seen this problem, so you need to help us identify 
what is unique about your machine. What filesystem are you 
installing Apache on, does your user id have admin privileges, 
what NT Service Pack level are you running...
Also, how many times did you try installing 1.3.4?

 I've tried on two NT workstations. Both are of NT4.0 and service
 pack 3. One has NTFS, the other has FAT16.
 Both of them are new to apache, i.e. never installed apache before.
 What I did was: 
 1. Go to: http://www.apache.org
 2. follow the instruction to get "apache_1_3_4_win32.exe
 3. double click on this file so that it starts installation.
 4. choose all default selections when prompted.
 5. select "typical" installation .
 6. when installation is done, a window with two icons appear,
    one to install apache as a service, the other to start apache
    directly.
 7. click either one will result in a dos window which goes off right away.
    "task manager" shows no apache.exe running at all.
 8. "apache -s" says missing configuration file. As a matter of fact, the
 conf/
    directory is empty.
 9. remove everything, then install 1.3.3. This version worked fine !
