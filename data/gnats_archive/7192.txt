>Description:
Hello, i'm from Brazil, and my English ins't so good.I have this problem:
I have a normal server with port 80 and maked a virtual host on my domain 

why.com.br --> is the normal server on port 80
loguol.why.com.br --> is the other host on port 8764

When i try to access the host "loguol" apache return this error

Forbidden
You don't have permission to access / on this server.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache/1.3.17 Server at loguol.why.com.br Port 8764

My configuration on httpd.conf is:
Listen loguol.why.com.br:8764
NameVirtualHost loguol.why.com.br:8764
<VirtualHost loguol.why.com.br:8764>
     ServerAdmin suporte@why.com.br
     DocumentRoot d:/apache17/apache/logs --> i need to show to a partner my logs, later i will use .htaccess and .htpasswd, but for testing i don't will use at this time
     ServerName loguol.why.com.br
     Errorlog logsuol/uolerror.log
</VirtualHost>

I have created the .htaccess file and .htpasswd file on logsuol directory.

At the same configuration on previus versions this have worked.
When I use 1.3.14 it works fine, but in 1.3.14 I do not have the
ROTATELOGS feature, and I need it.

Can you help me?
>How-To-Repeat:
http://loguol.why.com.br:8764
>Fix:
If we try to get any file on loguol.why.com.br:8764 it gives the file
ignoring the .htaccess/.htpasswd settings.

Example: http://loguol.why.com.br:8764/test.htm
