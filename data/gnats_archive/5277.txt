SunOS cello 5.7 Generic_106541-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10

Apache 1.3.9, JServ 1.1b   JDK 1.2.2, JSDK 2.0, compiler sun pre-installed.

>Description:
The JVM is repeatedly launched. What is intriguing is that 'while' the
JVM is up, servlets work! Then, when it dies and is being relaunched, 
servlets don't work. 

The JDK 1.2.2 runtime security has been disabled by granting AllPermissions
to everyone, and Apache is launched as root, with User and Group as myself,
on my local machine, -so there should not be read/write permission problems.
