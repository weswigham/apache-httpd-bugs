>Environment:
Redhat Linux 5.1
Apache version 1.3.1 (not the Apache that comes with Redhat)
Compiler: irrelevant
Shell: /bin/sh points to bash
>Description:
The apachectl support-script doesn't clean up the pid-file after stopping httpd. This results in an error message next time Apache is started.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do a "apachectl stop"; the pid-file remains in the /path_to_apache/var/run directory. This results in an error message the next time "apachectl start" is run.
>Fix:
I suggest that a line be added after line 84 (which is "echo "$0 $ARG: httpd stopped""):
rm -f $PIDFILE

- so that the "stop" portion will read:
=======================================================
    stop)
        if [ $RUNNING -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "$0 $ARG: $STATUS"
            continue
        fi
        if kill $PID ; then
            echo "$0 $ARG: httpd stopped"
            rm -f $PIDFILE
        else
            echo "$0 $ARG: httpd could not be stopped"
            ERROR=4
        fi
        ;;

State-Changed-When: Wed Sep  2 22:21:34 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
No, it does not and it shouldn't.  What should be done is
Apache itself should remove the pid file upon exit.  There
is another PR open on this and it should get done when someone
gets to do it.
