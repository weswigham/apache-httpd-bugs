>Description:
PATH_TRANSLATED is shifted to lower case from mixed case.  This is normally
not a problem on Windows, however the interpreter i am using (JRE, Java Runtime)
does care as when i go to run the java class file, PATH_TRANSLATED says foo.class
when it should really be Foo.class.  The change in case yields java inoperable.

An snippet of the environment for this script is shown here:
SERVER_PROTOCOL=HTTP/1.0
REQUEST_METHOD=GET
QUERY_STRING=showLogin=1
REQUEST_URI=/wpscripts/whitepine.pub.UserAuthentication.class?showLogin=1
SCRIPT_NAME=/wpscripts/runcgi.bat
PATH_INFO=/wpscripts/whitepine.pub.UserAuthentication.class
PATH_TRANSLATED=c:\temp\runcgi\whitepine.pub.userauthentication.class

Notice PATH_TRANSLATED is all lower case but none of the other environment strings are.

http://portnoy.wpine.com:7690/showbug/whitepine.pub.UserAuthentication.class?showLogin=1

I hope this works, sometimes our firewall lets stuff through and sometimes not.
Also this is my development machine and Apache may or may not be running (sorry!).
If not then simply create a mixed case cgi script name, make a call to it and
notice the PATH_TRANSLATED variable is in all lower case.

Dont really have suggested way to fix, just would like to see it fixed :)

State-Changed-Why:
Hello,
I did some investigating on this one, and as it turns
out, this is working as designed.  On Win32, PATH_TRANSLATED
is not required to preserve the case of the filename.  In
fact, PATH_TRANSLATED does not even need to be supplied
by the server.
There is a document I encourage you to read. It is a 
CGI spec which is not yet an RFC, but I believe it is 
headed that way.  You can find it at 
<http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/>
There's also a mailing list there too which you can 
subscribe and make your opinions known.

Thanks for using Apache.

 This is such a simple one.  Please i implore you to implement the fix i
 have suggested.  My only argument right now is that the fix suggested i
 describe comes from how your Unix releases implement this issue.  They
 provide PATH_TRANSLATED, and they dont shift the case.

Comment-Added:

No, it is not simple.  If you think it is, you don't
understand all of the issues involved.  On Unix platforms
PATH_TRANSLATED's case is preserved because the filesystem
is case sensitive; "X" and "x" are different files, and
PATH_TRANSLATED must be able to distinguish between them.
On Win32, "X" and "x" are the same file, and Apache needs
to be able to determine *that* for purposes of access
checking, et cetera -- so Win32 filenames are canonicalised
into an all-lowercase format so that comparisons will
always be accurate.  PATH_TRANSLATED is generated on the
back end of this process, and thus inherits the transformed
name.

You should not depend upon PATH_TRANSLATED in any event.
Try using REQUEST_URI and DOCUMENT_ROOT, both of which
are available to CGI and aren't transformed, to construct
the path you need.

PATH_TRANSLATED is only intended to provide *a* working
path to the file -- not necessarily *the* working path.
If you depend upon it, you are trying to interpret
Web locations using filesystem semantics -- which isn't
guaranteed to work, as you have found.
