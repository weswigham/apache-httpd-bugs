>Release:        1.3.6 (default version for redhat 6.0)
>Environment:
Standard out-of-the-box RedHat Linux 6.0.  Apache is the version delivered with 
RH 6.0.
>Description:
We have observed that the version of apache that was installed with RedHat 6.0 will experience
growth of the shared memory segment; we have seen shared segments in sizes exceeding 100 Mbytes in
less than 5 hours of operation.  Nightly, when we rotate logs, we would perform a kill -HUP
to start a new logfile; this would freeze or crash the server (Dell Pentium Poweredge 4300
single processor with 256 MBytes RAM, 512 MByte configured swap, 18 Gbytes RAID 5 using RedHat 
drivers.)

I did not see anything in the bug database for this, although I did see some similar
on Solaris.
>How-To-Repeat:
If needed, I can provide a copy of our httpd.conf file, we do virtual hosting for several domains.
