SunOS rcadps1 5.6 Generic_105181-26 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise
>Description:
Two identical machines with one having a local /home directory and the other a mounted home directory, the latter fails to handle authentication correctly.

On the mounted home directory, setting AllowOverride All, causes Forbidden on all pages with the following error message:
(13)Permission denied: /home/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

The setting AllowOverride None fixes this, but you cannot use .htaccess on any directory - they all require NO authentication.
>How-To-Repeat:
Stop the web server on the machine with local drives and restart it on an automounted machine.
