patched with ALL recommended and security-paches as of MAR-27
>Description:
Apache dumps core (segfaults) when starting. httpd -l works. When I remove the LoadModule / Add Module statements regarding the modules compiled as DSO, everything works fine.

Apache was compiled as:

./configure --prefix=/inet/apache-1.3.6 \
--sbindir=/inet/apache-1.3.6/sbin \
--logfiledir=/inet/trash/logs\
--enable-module=rewrite \
--enable-shared=rewrite

make; make install

compiler is gcc 2.8.1 and egcs 1.1.1
