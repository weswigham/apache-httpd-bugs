>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4 Workstation, Service Pack 5, basic build, no apps installed other than IE5
>Description:
Apache is installed in the default location - C:\program files\apache group\apache

I've created the htaccess file detailed below and placed it in /htdocs

AuthType Basic
AuthName "By Invitation Only"
AuthUserFile /passwd/password
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
require user testuser

I then create the password file as detailed below and place it in the /passwd directory

C:\Program Files\Apache Group\APACHE\bin>htpasswd -c password testuser
Automatically using MD5 format on Windows.
New password: ******
Re-type new password: ******
Adding password for user testuser

I've amended all references to .htaccess to read htaccess in httpd.conf
I've made the following change to AllowOverride

# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
# override. Can also be "All", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo", 
# "AuthConfig", and "Limit"
#
    AllowOverride All

When I access the default page located at /htdocs, the username/password entry dialog box appears. I enter the correct combination, but this is rejected. There are no error messages. On the 3rd entry attempt the server returns an authentication failure page.

H E L P !!!

State-Changed-Why:

AuthGroupFile /dev/null

the proper name is nul on win32.  Aside from that, this is
a basic config question we aren't able to handle via the
bugs tracking database... please refer to the newsgroup
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
for basic configuration help.
