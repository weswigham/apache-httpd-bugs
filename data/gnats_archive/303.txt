RedHat Linux 4.0 , kernel 2.0.18, gcc 2.7.2

>Description:
When trying to stop the server, and restart it, there is one server process that
will not die.  It continues to hold on to port 80, but does not answer requests.
This disallows a new server to be loaded, necause it cannot bind to the port.
This is a very critical problem, because this is a high-load web server, and we
need the ability to restart the server in case of config changes, or the like.

thank you.

 Are you sure it is an actual process?  Can you see it in a ps?  Is it the
 parent or a child process?
 
 How are you killing the server?
 
 Does this happen all the time or only sometimes?
 
 When it does happen, can you show me the output from a netstat (netstat -a
 would be good if Linux's netstat supports the standard BSD options...)?
 
 Does it cause problems when you send a HUP to it?  (I assume stopping and
 restarting referrs to actually shutting it down completely)
 
 Does this problem go away by itself?  If so, how long does it take?

 Yes it is a real process.

 well, at first by using the rc. script that starts and stops, but it 
 leaves the one process.  It cannot even be 'kill -9'ed  I have heard that 
 a newer kernel with some patches helps this problem...

 All the time.

 Dont have access to the box right now, and dont really want to mess with 
 shuttign down the server, since I have to reboot it to resolve the 
 problems it causes.

 Havent tried HUPing the actual server... we need to be abel to shut it 
 down, and bring it back up automatically for the purpose of safely 
 calculating webstats, and rotating logs

 Not that we have seen.. the server must be rebooted

 I would suggest you try that; it looks like it may be a Linux kernel issue
 since I have heard no other reports of Apache doing this and the behavior
 you are reporting sounds like kernel trouble.  Let us know if you find
 that a kernel change works when you get time for it.

 You can do log rotations by HUPing the parent; move the log file to
 another file on the same partition, HUP the server, wait a little, then it
 will start writing to the new file.  However, HUPing it may result in the
 same problem.

State-Changed-Why:
Please give apache 1.2b9 a try when it is release shortly.  Many
issues in this area have been cleaned up.  In particular I have
been able to restart the server 20 times per second on linux.  But
that's with a 2.0.30 kernel.  You should consider upgrading your
kernel if the problem persists.  (2.0.30 includes many tcp/ip performance
enhancements, well worth the upgrade.)
