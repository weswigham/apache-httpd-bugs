>Description:
mod_rewrite has the following comment and code:

  /*
         *  Ignore this rule on subrequests if we are explicitly
         *  asked to do so or this is a proxy-throughput or a
         *  forced redirect rule.
         */
        if (r->main != NULL &&
            (p->flags & RULEFLAG_IGNOREONSUBREQ ||
             p->flags & RULEFLAG_PROXY          ||
             p->flags & RULEFLAG_FORCEREDIRECT    ))
            continue;

I don't understand the reasoning behind ignoring Proxy Throughput on
subrequests. Specifically, we wan't to be able to Proxy URI's from
server-parsed documents (mod_include) and this prevents that. Also,
this behavior is not consistent with ProxyPass, which is applied to
to internal sub-requests. One could work around this short-coming
like so:


ProxyPass /proxy/foobar.html http://domain.com/foobar.html

except that this is a lot more internal work for Apache (and it
also happens to break if your .html files are server-parsed, but
that's another PR I'm about to submit).

Finally, nothing is lost by removing this restriction. One could always
impose it on him/herself like so:

RewriteRule /foobar.html http://domain.com/foobar.html [P,NS]

State-Changed-Why:
I have to apologize but I currently don't know myself
why I made it this way. But because I even documented
it this way there has to be a good reason why it is
that way. So, either I was totally dull when writing
this check or there is a good reason. Let me suspend
this issue until I'm really sure we can make the check
less restrictive or really have to keep it this way.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem now is suspended until Apache 1.3.0 because a timely
solution is not possible because I myself don't know what 
side-effects the chance could have.  For a later release I'll
reconsider this change again if I'm sure it causes no 
side-effects.
