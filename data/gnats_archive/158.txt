Problem reported for 1.2b2, still unresolved.

Variant list in r->notes is deleted and not returned if request is
processed in mod_dir. 
Example: http://xxx.xx/ -> mod_dir -> sub_req_lookup_uri(} ->
handle_multi() -> return MULTIPLE_CHICES -> mod_dir -> destroy_sub_req() ->
notes from subrequest deleted -> send_error_response() cannot send
variant list from notes!
