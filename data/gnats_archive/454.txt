>How-To-Repeat:
i can't repeat it.  this has happened about every 48 hours since i upgraded
from 1.2b7 -- and i've gone back to using 1.2b7 as this is a production
machine.

>Fix:
nope, but i'm happy to help in any way i can i.e. if you can tell me how to get 
a meaningful core file i'll be happy to do that.%0

 [Message from customer entered as PR#625; text moved here since it's
 about this PR].
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (hope this goes to the right list.  this is regarding PR#454 which i
 filed a few months ago.)
 
 i upgraded to Apache 1.2b10 and removed one of the two processors on
 the machine.  it crashed within 24 hours.
 
 if there is anything i can do to help debug the situation, please let
 me know.  this problem has been consistent since 1.2b8 -- 1.2b7 seemed
 somewhat more stable but still had the problem.

 Apache does not directly cause kernel panics -- they are due to either
 a hardware failure (e.g., bad SIMM) or a bug in the kernel which is
 triggered by something Apache is doing.  In this case, you are probably
 running out of TCP mbufs, which occurs when KeepAlive is enabled and
 connections get stuck in FIN_WAIT_2 state.  More info on that is at
 
     http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/fin_wait_2.html
 
 Please try setting
 
     KeepAlive Off
 
 in httpd.conf and let us know if that helps.  Configure should already
 be setting -DNO_LINGCLOSE during the complile.

 Configure is NOT setting -DNO_LINGCLOSE during the compile.
 
 i will set this option manually and see what happens.

 err, yeah, not any coffee this morning yet.
 
 conf.h sets NO_LINGCLOSE if SUNOS4 is defined.
 
 i'll try turning keep alives off.

 Are you using compiler optimization (eg. -O or -O2 when compiling)? 
 Apache defaults to doing so.  Try disabling optimization; to do this,
 uncomment the "OPTIM=" line in the Configuration file and leave it blank. 
 Verify that it is properly compiling without optimization by being sure
 there is no -O or -O2 flag on the gcc command lines when you make it.

State-Changed-Why:
We're now recommending that SunOS4 users use "KeepAlive off" in their
httpd.conf.  Without that setting it is known that the kernel
will panic eventually when it runs out of mbufs.  Please also upgrade
to 1.2 release.
