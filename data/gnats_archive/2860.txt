>Description:
I have MSQL installed on our machine. With MSQL I also have installed
w3-msql in the global /cgi-bin/ directory. MSQL Lite scripts can so embedded
in normal html-code and then be parsed with
http://server/cgi-bin/w3-msql/scripts/sql.html
Some of these scripts should be protected for nonauthorized persons and
should be kept in directories protected with .htaccess.

But with this limitation I can browse the complete WWW space, including
password protected regions. Installing the program only in a protected
cgi-bin doesn't help. Now I can browse the WWW space with only one password,
instead of the many different passwords in several subdirectories.

Since w3-msql cannot parse .htaccess files (and shouldn't, because it could
be run on other WWW servers with a different security model) the only solution
is, that the web server itself does the authorization.
>How-To-Repeat:
test.cgi:
#!/bin/sh
echo "Content-Type: text/plain"
echo
cat "$PATH_TRANSLATED"

http://www.server/cgi-bin/test.cgi/securedir/securefile.txt
>Fix:
The .htaccess file of the destination of PATH_TRANSLATED should also be checked.

State-Changed-Why:
No, the web server can't do the authorization because the
path info doesn't necessarily have anything to do with a
filesystem path; it _can_ be used that way, but it is very
often used in other ways.

Any CGI can do the same thing; if the files are readable,
the CGI would read them.  Would you blame Apache for a CGI
that just printed out the contents of every file on the
filesystem that were readable to the user.
