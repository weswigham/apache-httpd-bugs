>Description:
I have same problem as  PR number 7230.
Answer is simply "Please edit the Makefiles, and just remove the test directories." buy I don't know what part must I edit.
Please let me know what part must i remove from Makefile.
I remove test directories but I cannot still make.

State-Changed-Why:
If you edit httpd-2.0/Makefile, httpd-2.0/srclib/apr/Makefile,
and httpd-2.0/srclib/apr-util/Makefile, and remove the word
"test" from any SUBDIRS definition, it should compile just fine.

Thank you for using Apache.

 This works collect. I succeed to compile/install apache2.0 in my Solaris.
