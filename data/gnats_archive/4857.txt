All
>Description:
If you set up multiple different engines with the same protocol, host, or
port then the jserv status page only lists the last one.

The problem is that jserv_status_add_host() compares the mount point to be
added with any already added mount points using an OR instead of an AND on
the various elements (protocol, host, port). Also, when generating the menu
the engine counter is not incremenented (well it is, but it's getting reset).
See patch below for details.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have

<IfModule mod_jserv.c>
  ApJServMount /servlets/ ajpv11://host1.somewhere.com/

  <Location /status/jserv/>
    SetHandler jserv-status
    ...
  </Location>
</IfModule>

in multiple virtual hosts, using a different host for the engine.
>Fix:
Here's the patch:
