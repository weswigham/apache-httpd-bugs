uname -a ==> UNIX_SV brahms 4.2MP 2.1 i386 x86at
UnixWare 2.1.2 (SVR4.2MP), proprietary compiler, dual 200mhz-Pentium system
>Description:
The server at random times ceases to answer requests (indefinately) until restarted.  SIGUSR1 and SIGHUP transmissal will be logged, but will not revive server.
This server was running quite normally with one virtual host on a quiet web site.  I moved a busy web site to the server, with a handful of virtual hosts, and this problem began happening.
As a stop gap measure over the weekend, I was forced to make a cron-job restart the server every half hour.
I tried recompiling the server with USE_SO_LINGER, with similar results.  I tried running the server with KeepAlive Off with similar results.

I also recompiled without _POSIX_SOURCE (it was the only known UnixWare bug I could find in the database.)
I also made sure that USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT was defined in the compile, per the very first known bug regarding multiple listens.

There is no core dump, as the server processes continue to run despite their ineptitude.

In a 'netstat' of a frozen server, there is not an excessive amount of FIN_WAIT_2, but rather an "average" mix of statuses.
There are more statuses than server children running, however.

>How-To-Repeat:
The server has two primary web sites on it :
<http://www.cdprojects.com>
<http://www2.capcom.com>

They may or may not work when you try them.  The cron job will restart the server at 20 and 40 past each hour.
>Fix:
Not a clue.  All I know is that the server has been working fine until I added more VH's.
The machine is quite powerful (dual 200mhz-pentiums), and so it should be able to take a major beating.
I can supply conf files on request, as well as STDERR from a 'make'.

Hmm, perusing the docs again, I re-read the section on multiple listens.  It is possible that this is the problem (since I added other listens to the config file),
but the supposed fix is defining USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT, which is already defined in the SVR4 section of the 'conf.h' file. Hmm.

State-Changed-Why:
Do you have all the latest SCO networking patches applied?
Traditionally, SCO stuff has often had broken networking.

If you can, give it a try using gcc for a compiler.  This has sometimes
resolved such problems.

What happens when it doesn't answer requests?  Are connectiosn refused?
Do you connect and just have nothing answer?  What is running
in the way of processes when this happens?  Anything in the
error log?  If SCO has something like ktrace/strace/ptrace/truss/etc.
to trace system calls, see what the child processes are doing.
Try using a debugger on the child processes after recompiling
with -g in EXTRA_CFLAGS to see where they child processes
are when it hangs.

 No, I just checked on that.  I found a recently posted omnibus network=
  patch, but was unable to apply it because of a glitch (it wasn't=
  recognizing my OS version.)  I've contacted SCO about the problem, they=
  should respond within the milennium.

 I have had problems with the gcc distributed at the SCO FTP site, and=
  haven't had the time (or wherewithal) to go through the lenghty source=
  compiliation process required for a good gcc build.
 
 >What happens when it doesn't answer requests? Are connectiosn refused?
 >Do you connect and just have nothing answer? =20
 The latter occurs.  Nice happy TCP 80's appear in the netstat, and the=
  client will report "Host Contacted, waiting for reply", but just silence.
 =46YI - I attempted to access the web server (when in this state) from the=
  same machine (I used telnet), then looked at netstat.  The client process=
  was in "FIN_WAIT_2", while the server process was in "ESTABLISHED" (I=
  believe. I don't remember exactly.  I just remember think it very strange."
 
 Ahh, just tried it again, but with a different result (though I made a=
  configuration change, explained below.) =20
 
 >What is running in the way of processes when this happens?
 
 I imagine around 15 or so, which I think is what I have startservers set at.
 
 >Anything in the error log?
 Nope.

 Before I dive into that, I wanna try the network patches.
 
 Okay, since my last contact, I changed the configuration to disable all the=
  "Listen" directives and their cooresponding Vhosts.  I had hoped this would=
  be a temporary fix.  No such luck, though the behaviour seems more consista=
 nt.
 Now the netstat table is filling up with mostly 'CLOSE_WAIT's and to a=
  lesser degree 'ESTABLISHED's, with a small handful of 'FIN_WAIT_1's.  The=
  server is now actually refusing connections, as opposed to opening them and=
  then ignoring them.  This looks more and more like a kernel networking=
  problem, but I will get back to you after I get the damn patch installed. =
  This doesn't cause a general denial of service -- only the web server=
  hangs, but I can telnet in to HUP it.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, in it's=
  present state (after changing the configuration) it now recovers with a HUP=
  (where previously it quietly logged the HUP but still did not change its=
  abberant behaviour.)
 
 In short, I think that there is a kernel networking problem causing my aches=
  now, but I'm not sure if the patch will fix the problem with multiple=
  "Listen"s (which was supposedly fixed by USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.) =20
 
 I will get back to you with what I discover.
 
 Thanks for your time,

State-Changed-Why:
As of 1.3b4 apache will define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT for
unixware.  This has solved a very similar problem for another
user with unixware 2.1.2 on an SMP machine.  You can give it a
try by adding -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to EXTRA_CFLAGS and
recompiling.

I notice that you were looking in the SYSV4 section of conf.h,
unixware has its own section, look for UW.
