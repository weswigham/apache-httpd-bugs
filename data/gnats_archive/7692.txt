>Environment:
Linux 2.2.16 #36 i586 unknown (Slackware 7.1)
compiler gcc
>Description:
every time i go to a directory (not html or other page) from a browser i get a bad response. an error and it wont let me see any page. Lynx tells me "Alert!! Unexpected network error; Connection aborted. Unable to access Document." Netscape just tells me it cant access the page or no data returned or something. I have it configured for directories and errors and everything to be returned, as i have an old build of apache on this machine as well (1.3.12) and i copied the configs almost exactly when the first didnt work. all the modules are compiled in. i can run httpd fine by itself and it will load up. the error_log tells me "[notice] child pid 1417 exit signal Segmentation Fault (11)" every time i visit the directory (the root directory). obviously, the httpd process that viewed it is killed and a new one takes its place.  HERE'S THE STRANGE PART. if i put in http://127.0.0.1/index.html it will show me the page, but if i put in http://127.0.0.1/ it seg faults. i try it with telnet by only passing the header "GET / HTTP/1.0 200 OK" and it seg faults, then i try "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0 200 OK" and it works.
>How-To-Repeat:
go to the directory without the file name and it will seg fault over and over.
>Fix:
the only thing i could possibly think of to fix it is not compile in the modules or something but thats a long shit
