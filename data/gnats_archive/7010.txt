Cisco Local Director that sits in front of a bunch of mirrored web servers.
>Description:
IE does not cache images to the site.  Thats because ap_make_etag uses the inode for building the ETag.

The local director round robins the transactions.  When you click refresh on your browser, you will more than likely hit a different unit than before.  Since the file is on a different inode, its never cached.

Netscape does not use ETags so it doensnt appear to be affected.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.orderprocessing.net/webmon/imagetest/
>Fix:
The default_handler in http_core.c should make weaker Etags since it pushes static content.
Stronger Etags should be made for the other handlers such as mod_cgi, etc.
I think the problem is that Apache source has one ap_make_etag function for everything. After reading the w3.org doc, each handler in Apache should have it's own ap_make_etag function.
CGI's will make its Etag based of SQL fields, etc.
At the very least, a directive to turn off inodes would solve it.
Since all browsers and proxies look for Last-Modified, a directive to turn off Etags all-together, will also solve it.

Note: more and more web traffic directors are coming out besides Cisco's line.  Intel has a whole line of them to at: http://www.intel.com/network/solutions/e-commerce.htm
