I does not look like it is possible to change the "Server:" HTTP header
with the "Header set" directive.  Should it be like that?

"Header unset Server" does not work either.

State-Changed-Why:

Hi Gisle,

The "Header set" directive does not affect headers set
by the server's protocol handling routines, since that
might interfere with proper HTTP compliance (and a few
other things).  It says this in the documentation, but
only at the bottom of the page.  Header is really only
intended for things like Cache-Control and entity headers.
