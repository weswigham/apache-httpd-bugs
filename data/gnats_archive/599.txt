>Description:
Here is the setup:

       <Directory /home/adatta/blah/blah>
       is protected by AUTH_MSQL correctly.
       </directory>

This directory is a directory not accessible by WWW in general, and
is the real path. However .. (continued in next section)
>How-To-Repeat:
do this:
         ln -s /home/adatta/blah/blah /home/adatta/www
or public_html, whatever your setup is, then the <Directory> will
NOT be protected. In other words, the Symlink overrides the true directory setting.
>Fix:
It's not a major problem. In fact, you probably know about it.
I didn't, and it caused me some frustration on why it wasn't
asking for authorization. However, I figured it out.. :)
Just in case you didn't know about this 'feature'

State-Changed-Why:
Yes as you surmise we know about this.  This is now documented
under the FollowSymLinks option.  Apache just follows the
link, and doesn't rewrite the pathname that it is considering.
So you would have to protect /home/adatta/www to get what
you want.

Thanks for using Apache!
