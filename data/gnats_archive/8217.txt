It worked before.
Nothing wrong happened and it doesn't work any mmore
>Fix:
When launching manually httpds with right environnement variable (such as PERL5LIB) it seems to works fine. (Apache is started)
only apachectl won't work.

 Sorry I thought my browser was not responding and I clicked again on Submit
 Button.
 
 For the 8216 pb, we don't use PERL module, and when desactivating all PERL
 sections in httpds.conf, it works fine.
 This is what we tried yesterday after logging the problem
 
 We use Apache Server for Oracle Self Service Purchasing, which don't use Pe=
 rl at
 all.
