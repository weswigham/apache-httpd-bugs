>Description:
If MultiViews are enabled, and you request a document '/foo' (where for example foo.cgi or foo.php exists), then the QUERY_STRING you provide vanishes.
For example:

/foo?test -> QUERY_STRING: ""
/foo.php?test -> QUERY_STRING: "test"

>How-To-Repeat:
Take a randomly installed Apache 1.3.22, with mod_negotiation and 'MultiViews' enabled.
Then use for example a simple perl or php-script that echo's the QUERY_STRING.

If you provide the .extension (so mod_negotiation doesn't get invoked (i guess)) it'll display it. Else, the QUERY_STRING valuewill be empty.

Nope...

 Close it ... my mistake (it's a DUP! :) ... bug-db search isn't really helpful sometimes though...
