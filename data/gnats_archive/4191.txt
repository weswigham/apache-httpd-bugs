>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
SGI O2 - uname -a = IRIX 6.5 01221553 IP 32
1.3.6 compiled with standard SGI cc compiler as 
gcc 2.8.1 compiled apache was giving problems with stating all
non-resolved IP address as 255.255.255.255 for apache,
secure shell, etc.
>Description:
After doing an upgrade from Apache 1.3.3 to 1.3.6:
Hung child servers seem to be occuring in the D (DNS lookup)
stage with Apache 1.3.6.  This was not seen with 1.3.3.
Possible problem with apache doing lookups involving
servers that have:
 "Lame Server Delegation" or "Unexpected Reponse from Server"
(If you use nslookup, if gives the response:  can't
find X.X.X.X: "Server Error")

/server-status
   M  CPU   SS  Req  Conn  Child  Slot      Client           VHost
.. D 11.82 16529 0   0.0   18.28 18.94  141.99.196.217  www.ccp14.ac.uk
.. D 10.90 48424 0   0.0   22.19 22.19  206.48.227.102  www.ccp14.ac.uk
.. D 16.00 77922 0   0.0   14.42 14.42   12.10.201.31   www.ccp14.ac.uk

"Non Existent host/domain" seems to handle things OK - at least in
getting through the DNS lookup stage.  e.g., 139.82.89.14
=======

Doing the config and setup from scratch, Server status shows a
gradual buildup over a few days of hung servers on DNS lookup:

D   206.48.227.15
D   206.48.227.59
D   206.48.227.114
D   206.41.178.180
D   198.164.180.76

Have tried posting to the newsgroups to see if other people
have found this - no response - not even the typical
insults for implying/inferring Apache has bags.
Have not managed to find this type of
bug in the Apache bug database.
>How-To-Repeat:
If you can rig up a lame DNS server upstream from the
client browser, this should be reproduceable.
>Fix:
Could Lame DNS and related DNS server problems be 
handled in the same way as "Non Existent host/domain"
when doing a DNS lookup resolving the IP number to a
name.

Also, for IP address that do not resolve to names, 
might it be possible to send custom webpages depending
on the reason for the IP address not resolving - lame
DNS, Non-existent host/domain.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Tue Apr 20 11:32:59 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Apache uses the supplied gethostbyname().  Perhaps you updated
bind or something else in between the two builds of apache?
In any event, there's nothing apache can do if the gethostbyname()
library call does garbage.

 Thanks for your response.  And sorry for the delay in replying
 as I was using your information to have a look in other 
 directions.
 
 It turns out there is a bug in the SGI O2 IRIX 6.5.2/6.5.3
 with NSD (UNS name service daemon).  This is fixed in 
 the latest IRIX 6.5.4m (patch 3667).
 
 Thanks,
 
 Lachlan.
