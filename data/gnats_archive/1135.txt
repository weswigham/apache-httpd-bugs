here is the output from uname -a : Linux webworx 2.0.28 #7 Mon Apr 21 16:01:53 CDT 1997 i58
>Description:
The problem is my server handled about 250,000 hits a day untill I upgraded to 1.3a1 from 1.2b2.
I am using the same httpd.conf as before but now I have a load average of 10.00 - 90.00
I used to have a load average of 1.50 - 5.00. When I run the command top to see what is eating 
all the CPU time I see many of the httpd servers eating 50% - 90% of the CPU resources.

>How-To-Repeat:
Not really. Unless you want access to my machine to see it.

Hey sorry for not getting back to you. We have not had the problem since I
replace a failed Hard Drive. We have spiked since but that was due to a
large amount of cgi scripts running. 
I love Apache!!
Keep up the fantastic work!
