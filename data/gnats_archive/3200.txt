Win98 -  standard 1.3.3 binaries
>Description:
If you are not connected to a network - executing "apache -k shutdown" will wait for
a timeout before executing and shutting down Apache.  As you are shutting down, there
is no need for network communication.  The shutdown should be immediate.
>How-To-Repeat:
always.
>Fix:
none - sorry.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Nov  1 00:54:01 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Apache needs to parse the config files to know where to 
find the pid file to find what to shutdown.  Various parts
of parsing the config files may require DNS lookups, etc.
If your system is configured to have to send network traffic
to resolve that, then so be it.  Unfortunately, there is no
clean way to avoid it other than configuring your system so
it doesn't have to do this.
