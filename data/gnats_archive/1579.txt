>Environment:
Digital Unix on alpha, OSF1 ratbert.imt.uwm.edu V3.2 62 alpha, gcc 2.7.0
>Description:
I have an NCSA-imagemap conversion pattern that works fine on 1.2.4:

RewriteRule ^/cgi-bin/imagemap/(.*\.[mM][aA][pP])$ /$1

However, this doesn't match under 1.3b3, but does match if I remove the "$":

RewriteRule ^/cgi-bin/imagemap/(.*\.[mM][aA][pP]) /$1

Experimentation with various patterns seems to indicate this has
something to do with the number of characters.  These also fail:

RewriteRule ^/ccccccc/iiiiiiii/(.*\.[mM][aA][pP])$ /x
RewriteRule ^/ccccccc/iiiiiiiii/(.*\.[mM][aA][pP])$ /x

But work with the "$" removed.  This works WITH "$":

RewriteRule ^/ccccccc/iiiiiii/(.*\.[mM][aA][pP])$ /x

By fail, I mean that the rewrite log indicates the pattern didn't match.  E. g.:

40023860][rid#14003e910/initial] (3) applying pattern '^/ccccccc/iiiiiiii/(.*\.[
mM][aA][pP])$' to uri '/ccccccc/iiiiiiii/blah.map'

40023860][rid#14003e910/initial] (1) pass through /ccccccc/iiiiiiii/blah.map

I think all of my failures used the ".*" and "[]" matches.  One thinks maybe
they're accidentally adding characters to the end of a buffer?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try above rewrite patterns, check rewrite.log to see if they match properly,
or rewrite to obvious URLs...
>Fix:
No.  I didn't look at the code, and I'm tired of futzing with my server today..

State-Changed-Why:
Can you try rebuilding with "Rule WANTHSREGEX=yes" ?  Maybe
we're tickling some bug in OSF/1's regex library.

Thanks

Comment-Added:
It really isn't a bug in mod_rewrite because at least
under Solaris and FreeBSD I get the correct rewrite.log entries:

192.76.162.40 - - [24/Feb/1998:16:32:03 +0100] [en1.engelschall.com/sid#62034][rid#88034/initial] (3) applying pattern '^/ccccccc/iiiiiiiii/(.*\.[mM][aA][pP])$' to uri '/ccccccc/iiiiiiiii/test.map'
192.76.162.40 - - [24/Feb/1998:16:32:03 +0100] [en1.engelschall.com/sid#62034][rid#88034/initial] (2) rewrite /ccccccc/iiiiiiiii/test.map -> /x

As Dean said there is a good chance that
something under Digital Unix is broken, perhaps
their regex library. But we need some more feedback
from the user. Especially if WANTHSREGEX=yes is set.

State-Changed-Why:
We now have to wait for feedback by the user.
We think HASHSREGEX=yes solved the problem for the
user but we need feedback on this to close the report.
