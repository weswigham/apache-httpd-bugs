>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 4.2, kernel 2.0.30, libc 5.3.12
>Description:
When attempting to compile htdigest in the support directory, I get
an "Undefined reference to 'ap_signal'"
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure on a non QNX (I think) machine and try to compile htdigest
>Fix:
It appears to my tired eyes that htdigest is including a header file
that redefines signal to ap_signal, but doesn't compile ap_signal from http_main.c
into the binary. I'd probably move ap_signal into its own module and
add it to the compilation of programs in support/ that use it

This has been corrected, and the fix should be available in
the next release after 1.3b2.  Thanks for using Apache!
