>Description:
Is it possible to set LogFormat directive to have POST method trail format look like :
mars.web.com -- [O2/var/:00:00:59+0000] "POST URL path requested" \
"POST request input attributs/values"
I wonder which which source file of the apache distribution is 
concerned of this.

State-Changed-Why:
No sorry it's not possible to do this.  You could modify your CGI
to dump its own log.  It would be hard to implement this in apache
itself.
