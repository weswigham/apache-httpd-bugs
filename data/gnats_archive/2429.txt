>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0, SP3
Visual C++ 5.0
>Description:

In my CGI Perl scripts, the output of warn() does not make it into
the error.log file.  This was exhibit3ed under Apache 1.3.0 that I 
built from source with the win32_mod_rewrite.patch applied.

Prior to installing 1.3.0, I was testing with 1.3b6. Under the 
self-installing binary release of Apache 1.3b6, stderr is 
correctly sent to error_log.  I have not tested this with the 1.3b7 
release.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is the script I am testing this with:

#! E:\PERL\5.00464\bin\MSWin32-x86\perl.exe
#

# Use the CGI module and import all standard functions.
#
use CGI qw(:standard);

# Print the HTTP header.
#
print header();

# Use the warn() function to display the error message.
#
warn "Error message!";

# Print a greeting.
#
print "<BR>Howdy, World!";
>Fix:
I am afraid that I can offer no suggestions. I did a diff of mod_cgi.c between
1.3.0 and 1.3b6, but the solution was not obvious to me.

State-Changed-Why:

The script's stderr is only dumped to the scriptlog if
the script exits with an error.  Please try with 1.3.1
and have your script let the server know it had a problem
by exiting with an error status.
