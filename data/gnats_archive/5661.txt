>Description:
This has happened on 4 servers, some are Redhat 6.0, some are Redhat 6.1

Server will run, then eventually it will kill MOST of the child processes and become unresponsive.  There server then will fix itself in 10+ minutes and become responsive again, this happens over and over during peak traffic.
