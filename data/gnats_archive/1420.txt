>Environment:
Windows 95 MSIE4.0 Personal Web Server looks like rip-off of Apache
>Description:
I was poking around on my M$ win95 machine, and I was looking at the .conf files for Personal Web Server.  I noticed that they are almost exactly the same as those for Apache.  I thought you folks would be interested in that and might want to investigate the topic.  If I'm crazy or missing something, you can just send me an e-mail with doofus on the subject line, but I think it's not cool if M$ just went and compiled the source to Apache and called it Personal Web Server.

Thanks for reading this...

State-Changed-Why:
I really don't think that it has anything to do with Apache.
AFAIK, the original version of MS's PWS was based on the
NCSA code.  Apache was originally based on the NCSA code
as well, so I wouldn't be suprised if there were some
similarities there.
