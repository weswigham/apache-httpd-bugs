>Description:
This problem is like PR #2243.  You added a NameWidth which works great for
file names.  However,  you did not add the corresponding with specifier
(specifically, the '*' option) for the description field.  This means that
any meaningful description will be truncated exactly as described in PR #2243
That patch is for an old apache, and it looks like you added 50% of it.
I need DescWidth (and so does anybody else who uses AddDescription).  I think
it is a bug that you still truncate those fields.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://johnny.compsci.buu.ac.th/pub

I used netscape and lynx, so it is apache and not the browser.

PR #2243 is marked as closed but it should not be.  Please either discontinue
support for AddDescription (and remove it from the docs) or fix it so it can
really be used for something more than a one or two word description.

>Fix:
Apply other 1/2 of patch from PR 2243, adjusted to new apache code, that
would give a way to specify description column width, including a '*' that
says 'make it as wide as the widest description + 2 spaces' or something.
The default for description and file name columns should be '*'.  Alternatively,
remove AddDescription from apache and the documentation, since it is very
aggrivating that it does not work as expected.  Thank you.

State-Changed-Why:

Look at #2324 instead.  You may think it's a bug, but we
disagree.  It's just less than ideal functionality.
The fact that it doesn't work as *you* expect hardly
makes it reasonable for us to remove AddDescription
altogether.  Asking us to update the documentation
to describe the limitation would be better.  You say
that 'anyone using AddDescription needs this.'  Have you
actually surveyed tens of thousands of Webmasters and had
them all tell you this?

A companion to NameWidth will be added when it's added.
Watch PR#2324, which will be closed when it's done.

 Whatever.  I doubt you have surveyed them about it either.  With the
 ability to run on Microsoft products I believe you have also aquired the
 ability to use their attitude towards bugs.  Hey, "It's not a bug, it's
 a feature!".  I don't get Dilbert here in Thailand but your response is
 a good substitute.  And now, just for the record, I will attempt to
 appease your ego and humbly beg you to fix the documentation as you have 
 hinted that I am obligated to do before you will act on this:
 
      Although as a mere user of the free software which
      you have so graciously provided I am not worthy to
      even gather up even the crumbs under thy table, still I
      beeech thee to have mercy upon me and together with 
      the truly deserved flame you have bestowed upon me
      please also consider including the possibility of perhaps
      enhancing your already unquestionably excellent documentation 
      on the AddDescription feature of the FancyIndexing so
      that one even so immesurably dense and stupid as I obviously 
      am can understand that the apache development team, in 
      its infinite wisdom, has limited the length of that 
      description to that tiny amount which I, as a non-developer of 
      apache, am entitled to, and that if I am so blasphemous 
      as to even dream of having more that it shall be in vain
      since without an approved survey of tens of thousands of
      apache Webmasters, no such change shall ever come to pass.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 John Gatewood Ham
 
 P.S. ...and I'll water that garden with my tears...

 Thank you for the additional information.  I will cc this to the bug tracker so
 the next inquirer can learn these number limits without assistance.  JGH
