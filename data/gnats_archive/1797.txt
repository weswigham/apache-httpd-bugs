>Description:
I have implemented server-side includes and they all seem to be working
correctly, except where I want them to be the default "DirectoryIndex" file.
The index.shtml file is ignored and I get the normal directory listing only.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can't -- we're behind a firewall, sorry!!
>Fix:
I have setup the index.html file to transport me to the index.shtml file after
1 second -- not the ideal fix, but it does seem to work for the moment

 My guess is that there's a DirectoryIndex elsewhere that's affecting
 things.  You should hunt around for .htaccess files, and find all
 DirectoryIndex settings to double check that there's no other one
 affecting you.  I use DirectoryIndex in this manner all the time...

State-Changed-Why:
Waiting for user to grep DirectoryIndex in all the relevant files
to ensure it really is set properly.  I can't reproduce the
problem.

 config directory with did not list "index.shtml" as a "DirectoryIndex"
