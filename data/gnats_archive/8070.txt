>Environment:
Linux lin1 2.4.2 #5 Thu Jul 12 14:51:12 CEST 2001 i586 unknown
running as SuSE 7.1
>Description:
From time to time the Apache Server starts the wrong Virtual Host
instead of maybe the 4th configured Host the first is taken and displayd
in the Client Browser.
Sometime a simple restart of the Server solves that Problem.

>How-To-Repeat:
www.future-media.ch is the default host set up as first Virtual Host
others are www.stefan-haller.ch and www.it4all.ch

>Fix:
I've searched the SuSE Knowledge Database and found a similar error.
The Solution in this case is to disable the module dynvhost.
So I've done as described... but now the same error occurs

State-Changed-Why:

I've seen several such reports, all involving SuSE
Linux.  Please try recompiling from scratch using
the apache distribution from
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/
and see if that fixes the problem.
