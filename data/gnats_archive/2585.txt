What is recorded in the logfile for the localhost requests?
If nothing, then are you sure you don't have another
web server running bound to 127.0.0.1?  Check by stopping
Apache and seeing if 127.0.0.1 still answers.

State-Changed-Why:

I was not able to reproduce this problem using 1.3.2-dev
and a small test file. I would have tested it with the
original mp3 file, but the reported server is not up.
Have you tested the problem with 1.3.1 or later?

In any case, aside from the simple possibilities that
Marc already mentioned, a difference between the localhost 
and normal server address would likely be due to a difference
in server configuration on a per-address basis or a buffer
overflow in a reverse DNS lookup, neither of which can be
tested easily.

Does the server have multiple configurations for different
IP addresses (address-based virtual hosts)?

It looks like HostnameLookups is set to off, since otherwise
the logfile would say "localhost" instead of 127.0.0.1. If
it is in fact set to "on" or "double" and the lookup is
failing, then that is the likely source of the problem.

Severity has been reset to non-critical because nobody ever
accesses a web server using "localhost" under normal
circumstances.

 The server is up running again if you wanted to check it out. I just
 upgraded to 1.3.1, and still have the same problem.
 
 The machine does have multiple DNS entries (spand.cs.berkeley.edu and
 saber.cs.berkeley.edu both map to 128.32.130.56), but the server does
 not have multiple configurations for the two names--http://spand returns
 the same content as http://saber.
 
 Here is my apache configuration file. The only change I made to any of
 the configuration files is to change the port that the server runs on to
 80 instead of 8080.
 
 I configured the distribution with a PREFIX of /usr/local/apache-1.3.1.

 Apache 1.3.3 is available now.
 
 I've tried everything I can think of with the same file and still
 can't reproduce it on a Solaris 2.5 machine port 8080 or a
 FreeBSD machine port 80.
 
 If you could step through the request with the gdb debugger, as
 described in <http://dev.apache.org/debugging.html>, then you might
 be able to determine what is going wrong.
