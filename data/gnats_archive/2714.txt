 Ops, there is a bug, yes. But be careful. According to getopt(3)
 on my FreeBSD box:
 
  | [..] The getopt() function returns -1 when the argument list is exhausted,
  | or `?' if a non-recognized option is encountered. [...]
 
 So, adding '?' is not correct, IMHO. Because then invalid options are no
 longer catched. Instead the correct fix seems to be to change the httpd.8
 document: Not -? should list the usage.  Instead something like -h should be
 used. But because this is already used we usually first habe to rename it to
 -L and then provide a -h which does what is expected: Show a little help by
 giving the usage page.

 Getopt() returns '?' after it prints error message such as
 "progname: illegal option -- opt". So I think adding '?' is correct way.
 
 Check the file /usr/src/lib/libc/stdlib/getopt.c on your system.

 What do you mean by "error message"?
 
 I get:
 
 httpd: illegal option -- ?
 Usage: 1.3/src/httpd [-d directory] [-f file]
                      [-C "directive"] [-c "directive"]
                      [-v] [-V] [-h] [-l] [-S] [-t]
 Options:
   -d directory     : specify an alternate initial ServerRoot
   -f file          : specify an alternate ServerConfigFile
   -C "directive"   : process directive before reading config files
   -c "directive"   : process directive after  reading config files
   -v               : show version number
   -V               : show compile settings
   -h               : list available configuration directives
   -l               : list compiled-in modules
   -S               : show parsed settings (currently only vhost settings)
   -t               : run syntax test for configuration files only
 
 Which gives the exact output that you want from -? except for the first
 line saying "illegal option" which is arguable.  I think that is by 
 design.

 Correct, but at least the error message is nasty. And the behavior that
 getopt() really returns the "?" is not really portable I think, isn't it?
 When one wants the usage list one doesn't expect an error ;-) I've now already
 prepared a patch which tried to cleanup this option stuff. But nevertheless
 thanks for your report and inital patch.

 This line is error message of getopt().

 I don't think its design is good, too. Probably the behavior was
 designed that expects help message for illegal options, or it doesn't
 take the trouble to return "?".
 
 > When one wants the usage list one doesn't expect an error ;-)
 
 My patch prevends an error when you use "-?"(as manual says).
 If you use illegal options, printing an error is right behavior, isn't it?

 So?  I still really don't see the problem.  It tells you to use -? to get
 a list of options, -? gives you a list of options.

 "-?" is NOT an illegal option as the manual says, so that httpd should
 not show such error message.

 It is just a matter of semantics.
 
 The docs say -? gives a list of options, and it does.  It was designed
 this way so that -? is reserved as an "invalid option" that can be and has
 been documented as the thing to use to end up with a list of options.
