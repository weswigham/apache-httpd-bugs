>Description:
One of our customers was using RemoveHandler in an .htaccess file to turn off SSI for certain file extensions (eg: RemoveHandler .shtml)

When Apache first fires up everything is fine.  SSI is disabled for his pages and his pages only.  But after his pages have been hit for a while, this setting begins to affect other pages on the server.  It's as if the child process disables the handler but doesn't reinstate it after the pages are served, so the next request that comes in also has SSI disabled.  Eventually SSI is disabled on every child process.  Restarting the server "fixes" it.
