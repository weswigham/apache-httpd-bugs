>Description:
When a servlet is invoked through a SERVLET tag, the value returned from some
of the methods that deal with the URI path is invalid.

With a URI like /snoop.jhtml and a snoop.jhtml file containing a SERVLET 
tag invoking the common SnoopServlet, the following results are received:

HttpUtils.getRequestURL: 
  http://localhost/servlet/org.apache.jservssi.JServSSI/snoop.shtml
HttpServletRequest.getServletPath: 
  /servlet/org.apache.jservssi.JServSSI
HttpServletRequest.getPathInfo: 
  /snoop.shtml

Even though the Servlet API 2.0 spec is vague on what these methods should
return, the clarifications to the Servlet API 2.1 in the JSP 1.0 spec say 
that these values should be returned:

HttpUtils.getRequestURL: 
  http://localhost/snoop.shtml
HttpServletRequest.getServletPath: 
  /snoop.shtml
HttpServletRequest.getPathInfo: 
  <null>
>How-To-Repeat:
Just invoke a servlet that calls the above methods through a SERVLET tag
