 <p> </p>
 <ul>
   <li>You provide us with keywords pertaining to your company's target market. 
   </li>
   <li>Using our proprietary spider software, we spider the Internet searching 
     for email addresses that are on pages that match those keywords.</li>
   <li>We setup a database driven form, which allows the prospect to input their 
     contact, company, and any other relative information that you may require. 
   </li>
   <li>We send emails to the addresses collected. These emails do not contain your 
     company&#146;s name, so that your company is protected. </li>
   <li>Once the prospect has filled out and submitted their information, the data 
     is automatically written to a database. </li>
   <li>You may then login to our web driven application and view the current leads 
     that have been submitted. <br>
