>Description:
specifying ErrorDocument 401 URL does not produce the page that is suppose to
in the srm.conf:
ErrorDocument 401 http://www.ak-f.com/auth.html

Instead for 404
ErrorDocument 404 http://www.ak-f.com/missing.html 
everyting works properly.

For the authentication I use the module mod_auth_pgsql.
