>Description:
I have running php but doesn't process .html files, only .php
NOT a proxy problem, can reproduce it local but is harder

This is in the middle of the html file, not always like this... sometimes just scrambled tekst on html page. It doesn't load completely.
It also happens when you just load the page one time (first time) over the internet.

example:
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=BOTTOM><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="-2"><A HREF="DSC00032.JPG" target="ImageWindow">
<IMG SRC="DSC00032_t.jpg"  WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="80" BORDER="0" ALT="DSC00032.JPG"><BR>174.14 KB</A></FONT></TD>
<TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=BOTTOM><FONTHTTP/1.1 200 OK

Is your index.html file being parsed or is it being served up directly off the file system?
