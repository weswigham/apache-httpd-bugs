OS:  Windows NT 4.0 with service pack 3
Compiler:  Microsoft Visual C/C++ 5.0
>Description:
With ThreadsPerChild set to 65 in \Apache\conf\httpd.conf the Apache server
goes into an infinite loop.  Any attempt to retrieve information from the
server gets the following error:  Network Error: Connection reset by peer.

With LogLevel set to debug the following message is repeated in error_log
while Apache is running:

[Tue Jan 13 15:07:36 1998] file .\main\http_main.c, line 4042, assertion 
"rv != WAIT_FAILED" failed.

Line 4042 is in the function worker_main() after the call to 
WaitForMultipleObject() for the child_handles array.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set ThreadsPerChild to 65 in \Apache\conf\httpd.conf.
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, you are correct.

This is due to Windows very dumb of only allowing up a
program to only specify up to 64 objects to wait for 
an event on.  Guess we need to mess with that code to
get around this limit.

Dynamic thread creation and destruction wouldn't hurt 
either.
