Win95B Patched current - all hot fixes.
Pre compiled binary from Apache.org
machine with 1 PPP connection, no ethernet cards
>Description:
Getting the following error message loading Apache:
--- cut here ---
Syntax error on line 176 of c:/program files/apache group/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load c:/program files/apache group/apache/modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll into server:
--- cut here ---

File is present. Syntax was verified and is correct.
There was a previous instance of thie error in the database with a prev. ver
of Apache - but it was closed without resolution. Works fine on win98...
>How-To-Repeat:
Clean install of win95B -- Clean install of package.
Attempt to load proxy module
>Fix:
I've started tracing the problem, but haven't found the problem yet. I'll
let you know if I find a fix.
