Linux 2.2, Debian GNU Linux, no compiler
>Description:
After installing the binary package of apache 1.3.20 for Linux 2.2 on i686
architecture, the apxs script's first line says
  "#!no-perl5-on-this-system"
even though /usr/bin/perl is perl5.6 on my system.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Either tell people in the install README to fix it themselves,
or have some install script do it automatically.
