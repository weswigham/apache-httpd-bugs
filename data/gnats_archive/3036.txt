>Description:
I'd like to see application/smil included.

This is the media type of SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration
language) which allows integrating different media types (images,
text, audio, video, ...) into a timed multimedia presentation.
It is XML-based.

SMIL has been issued as a W3C recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/

The mime type is described in an Internet draft:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoschka-smil-media-type-02.txt

A request has been sent to the IETF area director to issue this
as an RFC.

Would be great if this could be included

Thanks !
