Unix, but sorry, don't know details. Our ISP uses Apache, not me. I can find these details if necessary, but I think they are irrelevant to my feature requests.
>Description:
This would reduce the Hi, our site is hosted on an Apache server and I have a few suggestions for new features. Regarding the access log:

1. It would be a very convenient if Apache could be configured to filter a list of particular file types from the access log. In particular, I'd like it if we could exclude image files (.gif and .jpg) from the log. size of the log file enormously and all we care about for statistical measurements is what .htm pages are retrieved. This should be something that can be configured differently for each site hosted.

2. It would be a big timesaver for me if Apache could be configured to automatically start a new access log at the stroke of midnight on the first day of every month (or weekly or whatever a given webmaster wants). We download our log monthly from our ISP and run an analyzing program on it. Currently, I'm taking a huge log file and cutting out a month's data or splicing log files together. This should be something that can be configured differently for each site hosted.

3. If you are sincere about soliciting feature requests, you might consider adding a separate "Suggestions" or "Feature Request" link to your home page next to the "Bug Report" link.

Thank you for your consideration,
David Moore

State-Changed-When: Mon Sep 11 15:51:54 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Your first suggestion is already implemented by mod_log_config's
conditional logging feature combined with mod_setenvif.
See http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog-conditional
Your second suggestion is already implemented by rotatelogs
which can be found in the src/support subdirectory.
Your third suggestion is implemented by the bug database,
but perhaps it should be made more clear that bug reports
include feature requests.
In future please enter a separate bug report for each issue.
Thanks for using Apache!
