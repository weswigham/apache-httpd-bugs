State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: pcs
State-Changed-When: Fri Mar 19 06:07:09 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Yes, this is a problem with the httpd.conf distributed
with Apache 1.3.4. You need to move the ExtendedStatus
directive below the LoadModule status_module
line.

The next release of Apache will have these directives
in the correct order in the file.
