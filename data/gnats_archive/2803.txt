AMD-K6-233 CPU with 256 Mb RAM
Windows NT 4.0 service pack 3
first tried with basic NT 4.0 then upgraded to service pack 3 (no difference)
>Description:
See above
>How-To-Repeat:
(1) download apache 1.3 binary version
(2) unpack (i.e. execute downloaded binary file)
(3) use methods listed under "Running Apache for Windows" general heading "Using Apache With Microsoft Windows"
(4) none of the listed method works
(5) do not make any changes to the 3 configuration files, as it is not required for an initial run
(6) try to find the SRC-directory with the httpd-executable (I can't find it)
>Fix:
I don't know what to do to get Apache going, I have tried everything I can think of.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Aug  6 21:24:41 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
There is no "src" directory with a "httpd" binary in for
Win32.  There is an Apache.exe installed in the directory
you specify during the install process, and there is a
program folder generated and placed on the start menu.

 Please disregard the last message.
 I finally was able to start Apache as a service.
 I first removed the Server service from the NT
 network - reboot thereafter. Then I found that
 I got error messages in the event viewer. So I
 said to myself, let me re-install the Server
 service for the NT network again. After re-
 installing the Server service (including reboot)
 it would not want to get started - not enough
 "server storage". Then I ran the NT service
 pack 3 executable again (reboot thereafter).
 To my delight the Server service was working
 again. Then I tried again to start Apache as
 a service, and this time it worked.

 I tried already the Apache.exe from the file manager
 I also tried the program folder start procedure
 I furthermore tried to run Apache as a service
 (all of this according to downloaded instructions).
 
 Invocing Apache.exe either from the file manager
 or the program folder gives me e few seconds of a
 black sreen, that is all, no error log generated,
 http://localhost/ does not work when launching
 the netscape gold browser.
 
 Attempting to run Apache as a service does not
 work either. Cannot find the Apache in the service
 window of the control panel.
 
 Maybe this will clarify the situation:
 I am trying to set myself up as an internet provider.
 All I have done so far is the activity with Apache.
 I don't have any primary or secondary DNS yet, neither
 do I have my server name registered with InterNic yet.
