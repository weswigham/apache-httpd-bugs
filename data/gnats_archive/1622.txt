>Environment:
Linux, kernel 2.0.14, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
This isn't a problem with buffering, if the output of a script( example analog log analyzer)
is put in a file, loads fine through web server.  But if the script
is run by the server, the server reports an error 500 and gives an error
like this in error_log:
[Sun Jan  4 21:54:49 1998] access to /home/httpd/cgi-bin/test-bug failed for 127.0.0.1, reason: malformed header from script. Bad header=<html><head><title>WHACK!</tit
Problem doesn't appear if there is a blank line between Content-type: and the beginning of the HTML.
>How-To-Repeat:
#!/bin/sh
echo "Content-type: text/html"

echo "<html><head><title>WHACK!</title></head><body>Wallop</body></html>"

State-Changed-Why:
But that's not a CGI header, apache is doing the right thing.
You need to read a CGI tutorial or something, there are CGI
headers (not HTML <head> things) you have to send before you can send the response.

Comment-Added:
As Dean mentions, the "malformed header" message is
correct.  The blank line between the HTTP and CGI metadata
lines (the response headers as opposed to the content
<HEAD>) is *required*.  Under no circumstances can it
be considered optional - it's part of the specification.
