>Description:
There's a formatting bug in rotatelogs.8.  This paragraph:

      logfile      
              The path plus basename of the logfile.  If logfile includes
              any  Otherwise,  the  suffix  .nnnn is automatically added
              and is the time at which the logfile was created.

Should read:
      logfile
              The path plus basename of the logfile.  If  logfile
              includes  any  Otherwise, the suffix .nnnn is auto-
              matically added and is the time at which  the  log-
              file was created.
