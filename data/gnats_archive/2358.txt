>Description:
The configure "--compat" option sets some variables to $prefix/something
when it would be better to eliminate the $prefix/.  The apache 1.2 defaults,
at least for many things in "conf" and "logs", do not include the prefix.
Removing the prefix allows relocation if someone uses the "-d" option.
I have been setting --runtimedir=logs --logfiledir=logs --sysconfdir=conf
which has been working more like what I expect.  I don't know if any of
the other variables should also be changed to remove $prefix.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm a little bit confused about which particular
paths you mean. Because at least with 1.3.1-dev (and
also for 1.3.0 because there were no changes
in this area) I get the correct layout:

:> ./configure --prefix=/tmp/whatever --compat --layout
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.1-dev

Installation paths:
               prefix: /tmp/whatever
          exec_prefix: /tmp/whatever
               bindir: /tmp/whatever/bin
              sbindir: /tmp/whatever/bin
           libexecdir: /tmp/whatever/libexec
               mandir: /tmp/whatever/man
           sysconfdir: /tmp/whatever/conf
              datadir: /tmp/whatever
           includedir: /tmp/whatever/include
        localstatedir: /tmp/whatever
           runtimedir: /tmp/whatever/logs
           logfiledir: /tmp/whatever/logs
        proxycachedir: /tmp/whatever/proxy

Compilation paths:
           HTTPD_ROOT: /tmp/whatever
           SUEXEC_BIN: /tmp/whatever/bin/suexec
      SHARED_CORE_DIR: /tmp/whatever/libexec
       DEFAULT_PIDLOG: logs/httpd.pid
   DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD: logs/httpd.scoreboard
     DEFAULT_LOCKFILE: logs/httpd.lock
      DEFAULT_XFERLOG: logs/access_log
     DEFAULT_ERRORLOG: logs/error_log
    TYPES_CONFIG_FILE: conf/mime.types
   SERVER_CONFIG_FILE: conf/httpd.conf
   ACCESS_CONFIG_FILE: conf/access.conf
 RESOURCE_CONFIG_FILE: conf/srm.conf

As you can see all compiled in paths to specific
files _are_ relative. So, which particular ones
remain which are not reduced to the relative variant?
