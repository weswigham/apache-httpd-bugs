>Environment:
FreeBSD gw.databeam.com 2.2.2-RELEASE FreeBSD 2.2.2-RELEASE #0: Tue Sep  2 02:44
:38 EDT 1997
Compiler: GCC 2.7.2
Perl 5.004_04 running cgi process.
Apache 1.2.6 with mod_spelling installed (and no other "special" modules).
>Description:
Apache occasionally loses the POST data sent to it from a form.
Tested this with the following Perl code:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
my $buffer = read (STDIN, $buffer, $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'});
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
if ($buffer)
{ print $buffer; }
else
{ print "No data!"; }

This CGI program was called, with POST data, from various browsers, including Netscape 3 and 4, IE 3 and 4, Lynx and Jeffrey Friedl's "WebGet".

Occasionally (perhaps 1 in 20 times) the CGI returned the "no data" message, indicating that the POST data was lost.  This behavior did appear to come in bursts - perhaps 5-10 negatives in a row, followed by 20-50 positives.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any HTML form posting data to the CGI program listed above.
>Fix:
No.

State-Changed-Why:
I've checked this with 1.3b7-dev and have a few
comments:

1. I was unable to verify the error. I tested 50 POSTs
   with NS 4.0 and every one worked correctly

2. I'm sure your given test program never run this
   way for you, because 
   - under FreeBSD /usr/bin/perl is a Perl 4
     which doesn't support neither "use" nor
     "use strict", etc.
   - the usage of "read" is totally wrong: read
     returns the number of read characters and 
     not the buffer (the buffer is already given
     as an argument).

So, I conclude that the error you observe is
either because of a programming problem inside
your real program or caused by some other things
we cannot reproduce with the current amount of
information. At least with 1.3b7-dev and the
following two files one cannot reproduce the error:
<html>
<body>
Text:
<FORM ACTION="form.cgi" METHOD=POST>
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="text" SIZE=20>
</FORM>
</body>
</html>
#!/sw/bin/perl -w
use strict;
my $buffer = "";
my $l = $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'} || 0;
my $n;
$n = read(STDIN, $buffer, $l);
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
if ($buffer)
{ print $buffer; }
else
{ print "No data!"; }

You either have to find the error in your real
program or determine some more information 
to be able to reproduce the error. Please
try 1.3b6 or a snapshot of 1.3b7-dev yourself.
Perhaps its only an error under Apache 1.2 which
was already solved (I found no entry in our changelog
but who knows exactly ;-)

Comment-Added:
it may not be specific to mod_cgi at all.  1.2.6 includes
some code from Roy which eats the request-message-body
in certain circumstances.  Stuff which needs to be there
to behave correctly on persistant connections.  It may be
wrong.  This is new since 1.2.5... and if the user has no
problem with 1.2.5 then this is the likely culprit.
