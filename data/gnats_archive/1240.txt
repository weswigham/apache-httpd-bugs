>Description:
NCSA httpd allows (requires?) that spaces in pathnames for redirets
be specified with \space. This causes an error 500 in Apache, which
wants paths with spaces to be surrounded by quotes. An important issue
when transferring from one server to another, as any pages in that directory
and below will become inaccessible.
