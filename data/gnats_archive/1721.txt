>Description:
---------------------------
This is the error message:

[an error occurred while processing this directive]

-----------------------------------
This is the cgi-stuff in access.conf:

</Directory>

# /apache/cgi-bin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.

<Directory g:/Pcms44/Build/cgi_bin/intelnt_debug>
AllowOverride None
Options All
</Directory>

----------------------------------------
This is the cgi/shtml-stuff in srm.conf:

# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
# Format: ScriptAlias fakename realname

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ G:/Pcms44/Build/cgi_src/intelnt_debug/
....

# To use CGI scripts:
AddHandler cgi-script .exe

# To use server-parsed HTML files
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

----------------------------------------
This the the shtml with the problem:

<!--#exec cmd="/cgi-bin/get_filter_cgi.exe CHDOC" -->

------------------------------------
This is the contents of error.log:

[Fri Jan 23 11:41:55 1998] [error] invalid CGI ref
"/cgi-bin/get_filter_cgi.exe CHDOC" in
c:/apache/webroot/pcms/chdoc_filter.shtml
[Fri Jan 23 11:51:49 1998] [error] execution failure for parameter "cmd"
to tag exec in file c:/apache/webroot/pcms/chdoc_filter.shtml


>How-To-Repeat:
Try an example such as:
(Where hello.exe prints "hello world" to standard out

<html><body>

<!--#exec cmd="hello.exe"-->

</body></html>
>Fix:
There is some logic in mod_include that does not execute the CMD but executes the
.shtml file it came from.

If I get further I will send the code to you.

THANK YOU VERY MUC
