Linux mars 2.4.18-pre4 #2 Fri Jan 25 14:42:30 PST 2002 i586 unknown
Debian Unstable as of the beginning of February 2002.
>Description:
I have:

DocumentRoot /var/www/
<Directory />
    Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch Indexes
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>

And /var/www is a symlink owned by root pointed at a directory owned by a user.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I would argue, although I'm not in a position to suggest any change, as I don't know the full implications of such a change, that symlinks owned by root might as well match a target owned by a user. Please let me know if I'm wrong, and if so, why.
