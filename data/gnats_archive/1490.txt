>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0  build 1381 Service Pack 2.  
Visual C++ 5.0
Running with AMD 200 Meg Pentium-MMX,  64 Meg RAM and about 100 Meg free HD space. 
>Description:
A CGI program writen in C (instead of shell samle program provided withe the server) which simply echo back all the environment variables supported by the server.

The server runs the CGI my echo.exe program but sends "blank" for the environment variable QUERY_STRING. 

Your bug fix list about "POST" method used by MSIE 3.0X which gives an extra CR LF and Apache server "eats up that extra CRLF does seam to be working under Windows NT version server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use following  program - compile it. Use compiled program as a CGI program  call it as "echo.exe"

-----------------------[ program begin] ---------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	
	printf("Content-type: text/plain\n");
	printf("\n");

	printf("SERVER_SOFTWARE = %s\n", getenv("SERVER_SOFTWARE") );
    printf("SERVER_NAME = %s\n", getenv("SERVER_NAME") );
    printf("GATEWAY_INTERFACE = %s\n", getenv("GATEWAY_INTERFACE") );
    printf("SERVER_PROTOCOL  = %s\n", getenv("SERVER_PROTOCOL") );
    printf("SERVER_PORT = %s\n", getenv("SERVER_PORT") );
    printf("REQUEST_METHOD = %s\n", getenv("REQUEST_METHOD") );
    printf("HTTP_ACCEPT = %s\n", getenv("HTTP_ACCEPT") );
    printf("PATH_INFO = %s\n", getenv("PATH_INFO") );
    printf("PATH_TRANSLATED = %s\n", getenv("PATH_TRANSLATED") );
    printf("SCRIPT_NAME = %s\n", getenv("SCRIPT_NAME") );
    printf("QUERY_STRING = %s\n", getenv("QUERY_STRING") );
    printf("REMOTE_HOST = %s\n", getenv("REMOTE_HOST") );
    printf("REMOTE_ADDR = %s\n", getenv("REMOTE_ADDR") );
    printf("AUTH_TYPE = %s\n", getenv("AUTH_TYPE") );
    printf("CONTENT_TYPE = %s\n", getenv("CONTENT_TYPE") );
    printf("CONTENT_LENGTH = %s\n", getenv("CONTENT_LENGTH") );
}
--------------------------[end of program] ----------------------------

On the client side use following HTML form to POST the form contents-

--- begin HTML ---------------------
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>GGI Simple test</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Welcome to CGI Test on Apache!</H1>

<FORM ACTION="http://your_server_name/cgi-bin/t3" METHOD=POST>

<INPUT NAME="CONTROL1" TYPE=TEXT VALUE="Your Name">

<BR><INPUT TYPE="PASSWORD" NAME="CONTROL2">
<P>Color
<BR><INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="CONTROL3" VALUE="0" CHECKED>Red
<INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="CONTROL3" VALUE="1">Green

</FORM>
</FORM>

------- end HTML --------------------
>Fix:
Most probable reason for theis problem is - Extra CRLF sent by MSIE to the server between the POST method. 

Your documentation some where says you have taken care of these "legacy" problem by eating away the extra CRLF. However this fix is not working on "Win-NT" server.

State-Changed-When: Sat Nov 29 06:46:36 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
QUERY_STRING is *supposed* to be blank if you don't
pass one.  QUERY_STRING is the text in the URL following
the '?' character; it has nothing to do with the method.
Try your test again with the change below in your FORM tag:

<FORM ACTION="http://your_server_name/cgi-bin/t3?qstring" METHOD=POST>

and see what happens.
