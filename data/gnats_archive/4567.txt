redhat linux 5.2, gcc
>Description:
the documentation for suexec states that if you put a User and Group directive in a <virtualhost> section then suexec will use those values as the target uid/gid to switch to before executing the script.  this is not happening... it's only looking at the group value.

[1999-06-10 21:30:18]: uid: (annef/nobody) gid: (annef/annef) cmd: lslocal.cgi
[1999-06-10 21:30:18]: target uid/gid (999/501) mismatch with directory (501/501) or program (501/501)

target uid should be 501/501

user & group in the main server are set to nobody (999)
user & group in the virtualhost are set to annef (501)
