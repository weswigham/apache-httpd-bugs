Module mod_auth.c
I've the compilation error : incorrect type with the functions :
setkey and encrypt
It'seems to be : int setkey and int encrypt in /usr/include/crypt.h
and void setkey, void encrypt in your source.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I've comment the lines in the module mod_auth.c
#if defined(HAVE_CRYPT_H)
#include <crypt.h>
#endif

I don't know the consequences .....

There is a bug in some IBM compilers....and you
