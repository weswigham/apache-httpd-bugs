>Description:
If parsed html is on the frame-offset in Netscape 3.01/Macintosh takes it's default value, 
regardless of the <FRAMESET ..... MARGIN=0> etc. specifications in the
frameset-document. MSIE 3.0/Mac however is not affected.

I tried this for both .shtml and .html by adding the line
  AddHandler server-parsed .html
to srm.conf

This side-effect happens also if there actually are no server-side 
include directives in the html source.

I observed that telnetting to port 80 and typing GET<CR> produced 
no Content-type header, just a plain html error-message. At the other hand
this behaviour is the same with no content-type header, so I have no clue...

This problem occurs on our local test-server, so I can't provide a URL.

 I really don't think this is an Apache problem.  Try telnetting to port 80
 and doing a "GET /path/to/document.html HTTP/1.0" (with an extra return,
 ie. a blank line after that), where document.html is one of the frames
 that doesn't work as you think it should.  Mail me the headers that
 produces.
