>Description:
If a directory has a Location directive for it in access conf (perhaps
even without it), .htaccess will be searched starting from the root directory
upward toward apache's directory. With a Directory directive, the correct thing
happens. Using truss, I could see that the httpd was looking for .htaccess
as follows: /.htaccess, /opt/.htaccess, /opt/local/.htaccess and
/opt/local/apache/.htaccess
While I might've been doing the Wrong Thing with Location, I still don't think
the server should attempt to poke at files in /.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a directory under htdocs, put in a Location directive for it,
attempt to use .htaccess in at directory, truss the server, see it dtwt.

State-Changed-Why:
<Location> only matches URLs, it sounds like you want to protect the
filesystem -- which you should use <Directory> and/or <Files> for.  In any
event, unless you've got a section like:

<Directory />
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

then apache will look for .htaccess everywhere.  That's the correct   
behaviour.  The <Directory> docs suggest this.

Thanks for using apache.
