This is perl, version 5.005_03 built for sun4-solaris
mod_perl-1.24
>Description:
The following perl content handler demonstrates the problem:

package Apache::bugdemo;
use Apache;
use Apache::Constants qw(:common);
sub handler {
  my $r = shift;
  my @c = $r->content;
  NOT_FOUND
}
1;

If this is handling a GET request, without a body, it works as
expected. The browser receives a Not Found response. If, however,
the request is a POST, with a body, server hangs.

I suspect that the main line code is attempting to read the
body again ?
