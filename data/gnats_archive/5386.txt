 Seems similar to bug 5063 as I have recently installed cold fusion.
 But I tried uninstalling CF, and reinstalling Apache with no change, 
 still the same error.

 In the first instance I did install over a running 1.3.6 (I forgot
 to stop the process talk about stupid). But then I stopped 1.3.6 and
 reinstalled wiht the same
 result. I did not uninstall 1.3.6.

Comment-Added:
Please try uninstalling your current Apache package and then
installing 1.3.12.  You shouldn't lose any of your custom
configuration.
