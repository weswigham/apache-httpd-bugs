>Description:
In a case with a Rewrite rule based upon a header, it of course, should send a 'Vary' header to let caches know that it cna change as the header changes.

However, it seems (at least in this one case), that it only is sending the 'Vary' header if the RewriteCond actually matches.  This defeats the purpose, as now someone (a proxy-cache perhaps) can request the page, not happen to 'this time' trigger the RewriteCond, and not realize that it can 'Vary'.

Example, the following rules:
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} X11
  RewriteRule ^/ingest/ingest.css$ /ingest/unix.css

The above rules, obviously, are meant to be a redementary way to send a different stylesheet to Unix browsers, than other Browsers.

But by the logic of the 'Vary' header.  This means that ANY TIME /ingest/ingest.css is requested, a 'Vary: User-Agent' should be sent to inform the client that the content could change, should a different User-Agent be sent.

However, let's test the following now via telnet:
> telnet host.host.com 80
Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xx ...
Connected to host.host.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /ingest/ingest.css HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Blah Blah (X11; Blah)
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 15 Mar 2002 02:32:46 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.22 (Unix) mod_gzip/1.3.19.1a PHP/4.1.2
Vary: User-Agent

ETag: "e7b712-387-3c915851"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 903
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/css

<Content Follows>

In this case, the Vary is correctly set.
However, now let's try a 'non-matching case':

forge> telnet host.host.com 80
Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xx...
Connected to host.host.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /ingest/ingest.css HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: My Own Browser that is on a PC
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 15 Mar 2002 02:34:51 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.22 (Unix) mod_gzip/1.3.19.1a PHP/4.1.2
Last-Modified: Sun, 30 Dec 2001 22:00:00 GMT
ETag: "e7b70a-386-3c2f8e60"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 902
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/css

Now this time, the RewriteCond didn't catch, and the 'Vary' didn't get set.  Again, this is a bad thing, because this file DOES in fact vary with the User-Agent, and therefore it should be reported as such.  A cache giving the last request would have thought it ok to cache it, causing problems when the X11 browser grabs a version from the cache.
>How-To-Repeat:
See Above.
>Fix:
The 'Vary' needs to be set upon any files the RewriteRule matches, irregardless of whether the RewriteCond matches.  The RewriteCond should only be used to note what it 'can vary on', not to determine whether to send the 'Vary'.
