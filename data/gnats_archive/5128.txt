>Description:
I'm getting a "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no HelloWorld in 
java.library.path" whenever I invoke JNI from a servlet. But it 
works fine in a java application. I already tried moving my dll
files to "C:\JDK1.2.1\bin" but it only works the first time the
servlet is run. It then fails on subsequent calls. I know this
is already an old problem, that custom class loaders do not support
JNI, but I just want to know if you already have a solution to this
problem.

Please help me. It's very IMPORTANT!!!
Thanks a lot =)

 The answer is in the FAQ...
 
 <http://java.apache.org/faq/>
 
 You need to have the path to your .dll in the java.library.path.
 
 If it works on the first time, but fails the rest of the time, then that is
 probably a problem with your .dll or servlet.
 
 Think about it, lots and lots of people use native JDBC drivers just
 fine...you just need to have your configuration correct.
