>Release:        2.0 Alpha
>Organization:
>Environment:
I use Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 4. Mi compiler is Microsoft Visual C++ 6. 
>Description:
Sometimes when i close Apache 2.0 with apache -k shutdown or with Ctrl + C appears a window that says something like this:

The instruccion on xxxxxxxx has make reference to xxxxxxxxx. Cannot "written" to memory.
            Close
Also when i compile with nmake /f makefile.nt installr instdir=XXXX a lot of warnings (signed/unsigned mistasch and only in service.c identifier "xxxx" undifined. Asuming external returning int. This example is in class ap_start_shutdown of service.c and other classes) appear. 

When I compile the debug version to debug, i get the error abnormal program termination from the C++ Debug Library.
>How-To-Repeat:
Only compile Apache 2.0 Alpha with Microsoft Visual C++ 6 with nmake and makefile.nt and compile the release version(clean all release files).
>Fix:
No
