>Description:
apache 1.3.11 is installed under /usr/local/stow/apache-1.3.11
and linked from /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include, /usr/local/libexec, ...
I am now compiling apache-1.3.14:
...
gcc -c -I/usr/local/include -I../os/unix -I../include   -DLINUX=2 -DMOD_SSL=207101 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DEAPI -DEAPI_MM -DUSE_EXPAT -I../lib/expat-lite -fpic -DSHARED_CORE -O2 -I/usr/local/include/ -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/X11R6/include `../apaci` http_core.c
The headerfiles from /usr/local/include are now taken instead of the ones from ../include
Therefore ADD_DEFAULT_CHARSET_UNSET is undefined and the build process aborts.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
change 
INCLUDES=$(INCLUDES1) $(INCLUDES0)
to
INCLUDES=$(INCLUDES0) $(INCLUDES1)
