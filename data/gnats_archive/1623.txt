>Environment:
Windows 95
>Description:
Although the documentation says in the FAQ(No,33:nph-scripts)
 that all cgi-scripts should now be unbuffered I can`t turn off buffering 
on Win 95 using Apache1.3b3.

A script working correctly with Apache 1.2.4 under Unix (named nph-err.pl)
does not deliver anything of its output until it is all completed.



>How-To-Repeat:
Any Perl script performing a delayed count-down should do.
>Fix:
Turn bufferung off when names start with "nph-" or introduce
another switch in srm.conf (??%2

State-Changed-When: Sun Jan 11 13:03:58 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
You are correct.  This is due to the win32 platform not
giving access to basic features like nonblocking sockets.
At some point this will be resolved, however it does not
appear like there is a clean fix.

State-Changed-Why:
Reopen improperly closed PR; the problem is still there and
is obvious by the fact that the code to set the buff nonblocking
is empty on Win32.
