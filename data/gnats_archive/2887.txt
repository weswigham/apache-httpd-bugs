>Description:
I've got a CGI which is running on another Apache server, which when a form is submitted from our usuaul web site it then goes to this site to run the CGI.
But unfortunatelty, it doesn't work with windows platforms, coming up with the error message 'Requested URL was not found on this server'

IT works fine on Macs, Unix and also even using Lynx web browser just not on Netscape and IE4 with windows.

Can anyone help?

Regards

John
>How-To-Repeat:
Try http://property.epost.co.uk/ goto the letting search and type in clifton in the area to search by.

Then it will work or not depending on the platform used.

Thanks

 Sorry, that URL doesn't work for me.
 
 Are you _SURE_ you cleared your browser's cache before trying?
 
 Are you sure you have your server configured so that
 /property/rentprop/rent-prop-srch.cgi exists?  This really looks like you
 simply don't have the CGI in the location on your server.
 
 What is in the error log on your server?

 It does not work with Lynx for me.

 Once again, what is in your error log?  and access log that differs for
 successes and failures?  It is important you answer questions I ask or
 there is no way we can help.
 
 If you enter http://cgi.epost.co.uk/property/rentprop/rent-prop-srch.cgi
 directly into your browser, does it work from any platform?  
 
 Verify that cgi.epost.co.uk is supposed to be pointing to 193.164.194.2;
 if some systems had different DNS info they could be connecting to a
 completely different machine.  Are you sure there is no difference between
 the machines where it works and it doesn't?  eg. a firewall, different
 network, etc.
 
 This is almost certainly nothing to do with Apache.
