Trying to compile apache with mod_speling everything seems OK, but httpd -l doesn't show up this module, and doesn't work either. Both ways where tried, (manual and APACI), no problem with files missing, no problem with configuration files (in modules.c the spel mod is added and in /modules/standard/Makefile under OBJS too)

 Are you sure you are running the right copy of httpd?  Try prepending the
 entire path to the name, or do ./httpd in the directory it is in.
 
 Does mod_speling show up in the compiling lines while it is being
 compiled?

State-Changed-Why:
You *are* using the CheckSpelling directive to activate
the module, correct?  No corrections will be made if
you don't turn the checking on.

Do you get an error message at server startup time about
the CheckSpelling directive(s)?  If you don't get an error
message about your uses of the directive, then the module
has been built into the server and the problem is somewhere
else.

Note also that hand-editing the generated modules.c file
is not sufficient in all cases. When adding a module, the
best choice is still re-running Configure (or configure).

 Yes, I'm sure. I'm running the right copy.
 And yes, when Apache is compiling the mod_speling shows up, no problem with
 this.
 Other strange thing is that if I use the
 =2E/configure --enable-module=3Dall
 Happens more or less the same thing, The Makefile is right, and modules.c
 too, but when I try httpd -l to see them it doesn't show up all the modules=
 ,
 even when in the compiling lines all modules showed up.
 
 Thanks in advance for your help
