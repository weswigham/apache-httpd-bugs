>Release:        1.2.4
>Environment:
All Versions of RedHat Linux from 4.0 - 5.0, possibly earlier versions.
>Description:
For Redhat 4.X, The Configure script generates an incorrect LIBS1= line when
you are using mod_auth_dbm
It should read LIBS1= -ldb, not LIBS1= -ldbm

For Redhat 5.X, The line still reads LIBS1 = -ldb, when to generate a working
binary it should read:
LIBS1 = -lgdbm -lcrypt
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to compile with default Makefile after enabling mod_auth_dbm in
Configuration file
>Fix:
Fix Configure/Configuration.. I haven't cared to look into it

State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sat Dec 20 12:27:39 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Known bug, which is fixed in 1.3.  The problem is that there's
about four different ways that linux libraries are built and
apache 1.2 has no way to guess how the heck to link properly.
