>Description:
A "Location:" header emitted by an ErrorDocument 404 handler is not handled
correctly, as compared to one emitted by a normal document-space CGI script:
When emitted by a document-space CGI script, the redirection is handled
internally by the server.  However, when emitted by an ErrorDocument 404
handler, the header is emitted to the client browser.  No mention is made in
any normal user documents of a need for an additional "Status:" header.

Background:
=============================================================================
I researched this problem by examining the FAQ, looking for any relevant
entries, and did not find any.  I also searched the bug database using
"ErrorDocument cgi" as a search string.  Of the 75 documents returned, only
PR number 4008 appeared related to this problem, but it did not have a
complete solution.  I also examined the apacheweek page at
	http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/96-05-17#underdev
(referenced in the PR) but it did not provide any useful information.

These tests were performed on Apache 1.3.22 under FreeBSD 4.4.  They were done
in response to the message thread originally started by a question from
Sivakatirswami <katir@hindu.org> on Sun, 23 Dec 2001 19:30:09 -1000 entitled
"CGI Handling ErrorDocument 404/Redirect to external URI" which I have been
answering.

>How-To-Repeat:
From my httpd.conf:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
  DirectoryIndex index.php index.cgi index.shtml index.html index.htm
</IfModule>
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Simplified) index.cgi from L5Sofware.com:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Location: "/swframe.shtml\n\n";
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Partial) telnet connection and resulting server output from index.cgi:

****** NOTE: *********
The httpd.conf entry and badurl.cgi file described below were made for testing
this problem only:  The server has been returned to its production setup.
However, anyone working on this problem should be able to do the same changes
on _their_ system, and get the same results:

From (test) httpd.conf:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
ErrorDocument 404 /cgibin/badurl.cgi

badurl.cgi:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Location: http://www.HimalayanAcademy.com/index.html\n\n";
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the telnet session illustrated below, I entered the "GET" and "Host:"
lines, followed by a blank line. This caused the server to emit the response
that follows.

>Fix:
I believe the code should be modified to cause "Location:" headers to be handled
the same way in all cases.  However, as a work-around, it is possible to add
a redirection "Status:" header that will tell the client browser to perform the
redirection.  This should at least be added to the documentation.
