>Description:
Servlet : 
It has service method, and opens an input stream to read
serialized binary object, and output stream to write a response 
respectively. And I have the authorization key included in the serialized
object.
Applet :
applet opens an object output stream over URLConnection to the servlet, 
and write the serialized object including aouthorization code,  and get
the result by reading the input stream, that is opened just after writing 
the request.

Here is my problem. If I write an application with java or C++, or anything
it doesn't metter, I can connect to the servlet as the way applet does, and write 
the serialized object to servlet, I can invoke servlet, run it and get the result,
success information, becouse I have the source of the binary serialized object
that is used for communication. But as you know, it is not to difficult to find
the java code of binary class file of any applet or object, becouse it is already
downloaded in to your local machine, there are lots of java decompilers around.
As a metter of fact, this results an unwanted behaviour of business becouse 
nobody needs to download my applet or connect to my web page any more.

>Fix:
May the connecting client should be detected if it a browser or an application.

Erm... what you are saying doesn't make any sense.

Of course someone can send the same information that an
applet could however they want.  If you don't want them to
be able to do that, you have to design your applet and
protocol to make that more difficult.  There is nothing that
the web server should or could do about it.  It certainly
doesn't have any magic way to know what is connecting to it.
