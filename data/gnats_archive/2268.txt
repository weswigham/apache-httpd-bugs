>Unformatted:
  PR 2252 wasn't corrected in 1.3b7. I wanted to bring attention to this so
it could hopefully get fixed before 1.3.0 comes out. The PR suggests a fix
which is only one line and seems to work on the web servers I've applied it
to. It causes a memory leak for anyone running mod_fastcgi.
