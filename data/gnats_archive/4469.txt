>Description:
Trying to configure mod_auth_db with Berkeley db v.2 as packaged on Debian
2.1 fails due to the fact that this library is named libdb2 instead of libdb
which the configuration script checks. Naming it libdb would break the system
because it's meant to co-exist together with libdb 1.85 which then is called
libdb, and also references from precompiled binaries would be a problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a Debian-2.1 and don't install libdb (1.85) but only libdb2, then
enable mod_auth_db in src/Configuration and try to run Configure... You get
a message "there is neither Berkeley 1 nor 2 installed" or so, from
modules/standard/mod_auth_db.module which I was unable to modify appropriately.
>Fix:
Yes, please fix modules/standard/mod_auth_db.module.
