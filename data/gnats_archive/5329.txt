>Description:
Truss shows hanging CGI.  Apache times out, tries to kill it and fails since
it no longer shares ownership.  The httpd process then hangs out until the 
CGI finally dies.  RLimit's help, but in this case the CGI process takes
a long time so we can't just arbitrarily set them low.

>How-To-Repeat:
A CGI doing a sleep long enough should replicate it.
>Fix:
Um...er...well...no.  Perhaps the httpd process could fork suexec and
and ask it to kill the process?  I don't know if the child has any way 
of talking back to the parent.
