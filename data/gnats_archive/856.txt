Linux 2.0.0
>Description:
We just converted from the NCSA server on a Sun Solaris machine to the Apache
server on a Pentium running Linux.  Since the changeover, everyone at my site
who uses Netscape on a Macintosh have noticed garbage on their screen when they
try to view web pages.  After numerous reloads in Netscape, the garbage on the 
screen goes away and the page is displayed as it should be.  I have tried 
clearing the cache in Netscape and have tried boosting the amount of memory
allocated to Netscape, but nothing seems to fix this problem.  Do I need to
modify the configuration files on the Linux server to recognize Macintosh
clients?

Other than constantly hitting the reload button, I have not figured out a way
to fix this problem

State-Changed-Why:
First, 1.1 is no longer a supported release.  Please
use 1.2.1.

"garbage" doesn't say much.  Do clients on other platforms
work OK?  If so, you probably have some bug in your
Macintosh TCP stack or in Netscape.  It is also possible
that the version of Linux you are using is buggy.  You
may want to try upgrading your Linux kernel to the latest
2.0.x version.

There is nothing in Apache that should cause anything
of this nature.  Apache does not know or care what platform
a client is using.

 By "garbage", I meant that the fonts come out looking like nonsense
 characters and the images do not load properly.  I have noticed this 
 same phenomenon on Unix clients as well.  We will try upgrading both
 Linux and Apache to see if that solves the problem.  Thanks for your
 quick response.
