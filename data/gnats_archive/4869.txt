>Description:
I'll try to build up a rewrite rule logic that allows me to rewrite proxy requests on a per-dir basis. For that, I've included the following rule in httpd.conf:

RewriteRule ^proxy:([^:]*:)//([^/]*[/].*$) /proxyrequests/${ident-to-dir:%{REMOTE_ADDR}|default}/$2 [l,env=PTYPE:$1//]

An example rule in /proxyrequests/default/.htaccess could be this one:

RewriteRule (.*) %{ENV:PTYPE}$1 [p]

Now, if the requested URL contains a port number, like e.g. http://www.foobar.com:8080/, I'll get an Forbidden reply.

After hook_uri2file mod_rewrite reports an
"go-ahead with /apache/htdocs/proxyrequests/default/www.foobar.com:8080/ [OK]"

The subsequent "dirwalk" will fail, though, because "ap_os_is_filename_valid"
considers this file name invalid.

 
>How-To-Repeat:
See description above:

Add the RewriteRule to httpd.conf. You can omit the RewriteMap directive. I assume that doesn't change the behaviour. Set up the appropriate .htaccess file. Type in a URL that contains a port number.
>Fix:
I must confess that I still haven't completely figured out how mod_rewrite works. The PTYPE hack in the rule above is my poor man's solution to the fact that I can't keep the schema part in the URL, otherwise all rewrites will fail.

The short-hand work around is to also strip the host part from the URL and have mod_rewrite work on the rest. But then, I can't have such clever things like host based rewriting.

So I'm waiting for a more throughout solution, either by modifications to the software or by explaining me a more clever way to do the things I want to do.
