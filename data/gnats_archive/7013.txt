>Description:
ERROR 1
This is the error I receive when a php3 file is in the root of my virtual directory.  This error occured when browsing to the virtual root c:\nusphere\apache\htdocs\spgrgraube\default.php3.  The php file works fine if it is under the original root directory.

Fatal error: Unable to open c:\nusphere\apache/htdocs/default.php3 in Unknown on line 0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR 2

When surfing to virtual directory spgrgraube2.  This directory has a default.cfm file.  This cfm file works correctly under the root with coldfusion installed.


Error Occurred While Processing Request
Error Diagnostic Information
The template specification, '\nusphere\apache\htdocs\rcmodeler\default.cfm', is illegal. 

Template specifications cannot include '..' nor begin with a backslash ('\\').
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are my directives  I am able to surf to these sites as long as my files are named html, my php3 code does not function when I do this.

Any help would be appriciated.  

Thank You

This has been reported before, please review the existing bug
reports.

Apache 1.3.13+1.3.14 -require- forward slashes in all path names
in the httpd.conf file (and command line options).  This will be
resolved, and be more flexible (either backslash or forward
slashes accepted) in the upcoming 1.3.15 release.
