 Erm... please tell me exactly what your problem is.  You don't actually
 say what you are doing, what you see, and what you think you should see.
 
 If your computer can't resolve a hostname, it has nothign to do with
 Apache.

 My apologies:
 
 	It is that the given network hostname wasn't granted priviledges for
 the majority of TCP/IP Protocols. Things looked fine internally, yet,
 not available to the outside. This will be changed within the next few
 days. Thankyou for you time.
