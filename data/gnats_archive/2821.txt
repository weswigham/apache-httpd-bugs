Windows 95
>Description:
When running the cgienv.exe program obtained from Bluestone Software for 
trouble-shootng Sapphire/Web installations, the CLASSPATH and 
environment variables are not reported.  When executing the program from 
the command line, these variables are visable.  Sapphire/Web cannot
run Java since the classes cannot be initailized due to the java classes 
not being in the CLASSPATH.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the ecgienv.exe program available from Bluestone software for Sapphire/Web 
troubleshooting.
>Fix:
I have tried SetEnv commands to establish the environment variables with no results

State-Changed-Why:
Exactly what SetEnv commands have you tried?

Of course they won't be visible if you don't tell Apache
properly to set them.

Are you sure you restarted Apache after adding the SetEnv?

 I entered the following in srm.conf:
 
 SetEnv sapphire c:\sapphire
 
 I restarted Apache, but did not see the entry.  Can SetEnv
 be used to set the classpath?
 
 Thanks...  Roger

No response since August, and the user will not give
the way he is using SetEnv to troubleshoot.
Thanks for using Apache.
