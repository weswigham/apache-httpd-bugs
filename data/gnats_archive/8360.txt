>Description:
I'm trying to make a rewrite rule that matches any page requests from this latest code red type worm. An example request:

http://www.domain.com/scripts/..%2f../winnt/system32/cmd.exe

I'm using the following RewriteRule:

RewriteRule cmd\.exe http://www.microsoft.com [R]

When requesting the example URL apache reports a 404 Not found error. However, if you remove the %2f characters from the URL (or replace with something like %20) it matches and redirects to www.microsoft.com as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.domain.com/scripts/..%2f../winnt/system32/cmd.exe
>Fix:
no :)
