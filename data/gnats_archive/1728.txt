Here is an output from a mod_status report that is really wrong 

  Current Time: Fri Jan 23 16:01:33 1998
   Restart Time: Fri Jan 23 12:02:15 1998
   Server uptime: 3 hours 59 minutes 18 seconds
   Total accesses: 676023206 - Total Traffic: 18.3 GB
   CPU Usage: u1251.32 s4604.36 cu712.87 cs267.3 - 47.6% CPU load
   4.71e+04 requests/sec - 1.3 MB/second - 29 B/request
   272 requests currently being processed, 183 idle servers

The total number of accesses is WAY above normal as well as the number of
requests/second.  What I saw an hour earlier was more like 53 requests/sec
with about 2-3GBytes.  I am reporting this without any more information but
somehow I am suspecting some sort of overflow in the fields used to record
the information.

>How-To-Repeat:
At this time this is just a report.  And so do not quite know how to make
this happen but again I have suspecions.

Sorry NO

 What, you don't think your server can handle 40000 hits/sec?

 Mmm.  Totals get far higher than what you say yours should be without
 problems.  
 
 Are you running any third-party modules on the server?  You sure you don't
 have them in some odd loop or something?

 I do have the MAX_SERVER_LIMIT upped to 1024 (from the standard 512)
 but as I have been running this version since it has been released,
 and never seen these problems before, it is curious.  And in fact,
 I have NOT included some unneeded modules to improve performance.
 
 Another thought is an improper signed/unsigned operation somewhere
 with sign smear.

State-Changed-Why:
it's possible there was some memory corruption going on; 
we have tracked down and fixed a number of bugs which
could have caused random stack trashing.  Could you try
running 1.3b6, or even better a current CVS snapshot 
from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/, and let us know if
you see this again?  Thanks.

 I am now running 1.3b6 and have not seen this problem
 for quite awhile after reporting it.
