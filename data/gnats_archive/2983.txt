>Description:
At line 838 of modules/proxy/proxy_cache.c is says:

 * what responses should we not cache?
 * Unknown status responses and those known to be uncacheable
 * 304 response when we have no valid cache file, or
 * 200 response from HTTP/1.0 and up without a Last-Modified header, or
 * HEAD requests, or
 * requests with an Authorization header, or
 * protocol requests nocache (e.g. ftp with user/password)
 */
    if ((r->status != 200 && r->status != 301 && r->status != 304) ||
        (expire != NULL && expc == BAD_DATE) ||
        (r->status == 304 && c->fp == NULL) ||
        (r->status == 200 && lmods == NULL && is_HTTP1) ||

which deletes (after caching) files which don't have a last-modified
header. But assuming the current time for the last modified time is a 
totally safe assumption as far as a cache client is concerned.

Isn't the code being overzealous here? Shouldn't it just assume that 
the last modified time is the time at which the file was cached?


safe assumption
