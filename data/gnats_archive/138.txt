>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.4, vif 1.1, BIND 4.9.5 (inc shared libs), gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
The system will eventually crash as no more mbufs are available. I presume this
is something to do with the SO_LINGER/FIN_WAIT problem.

I have reverted to Apache 1.1.3, which runs fine. I have not attempted v1.2.b6
though it compiles fine.

Most modules installed, except msql and extra authorisation types.
>How-To-Repeat:
run latest Apache on SunOS 4.1.4 configuration described above.
>Fix:
not use linger code %3

State-Changed-Why:
Does netstat show lots of connections in FIN_WAIT_2?
Please give 1.2b6 a try if you can.  We have made some
fixes that _may_ help it; we don't know for sure yet.  
Also see http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/fin_wait_2.html
for some details on the problem and possible solutions.
