This is fixed in 1.2.5 and 1.2.6!

State-Changed-Why:
Modules are supposed to be initialized twice, and they have
been for a long time and will be for the forseeable future
in the 1.x code.

I suspect your confusion comes from some third-party patch
you applied to your 1.2.x code that makes initialization only
happen once.  Note that doing so can break some modules that
rely on it happening twice.

 And we do not want to mess with the way it is done now because, as you
 say, it creates problems for numerous modules.  It was tried in one beta.
 It caused so many problems we had to go back.
 
 In 2.0, this will likely be revisited.

Comment-Added:
Another reason not mentioned is that the server does know
things such as where the error log will be until after it
has read the file... and so it can't report configuration
errors to the error log without doing things twice.  Or
some such silliness.
