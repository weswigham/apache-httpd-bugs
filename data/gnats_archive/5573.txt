>Organization:
>Environment:
win95 using php4
>Description:
I have installed the win32 binary ver of apache 1.3.9 and the win32 binary 
ver of php4. All the .dll files are where they should be. Howver when tryinga
url to pull up a file I get a windows error window pop up and tell me that the
program (php) has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

If *all* I do is copy the php.exe binary for php3 the exact same scenario works
fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. load up apache 1.3.9
2. install php4
3. create a test php3 file
4. in a browser (I use Netscape) enter http://localhost/php-cgi/php.exe/test.php3
(obviously changing php-cgi for you own config.

no.
