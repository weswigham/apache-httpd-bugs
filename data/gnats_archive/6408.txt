>How-To-Repeat:
Hi pal,
We are trying to use smart upload package for uploading files (sizes more than 3mb)
We have tested with Windows nt architecture , it is working fine for files of any size.

But for the architectre shown below:

Webserver(listner) : Apache/linux,
Application Server :  Weblogic/linux.

We are using apche weblogic bridge (linux), but when we try to upload,  if the file size is less than 400k it is fine
In the smart upload we have not mentioned(max size) any file size, by default it uploads any size.
But for more than 400k it is giving the error message

State-Changed-When: Sun Sep 17 22:23:50 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
If you are really using Apache 1.2, you should really
try a less ancient version.  Otherwise, I would
recommend contacting Weblogic for support.
