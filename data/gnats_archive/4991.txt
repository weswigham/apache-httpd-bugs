State-Changed-Why:

What are the *exact* settings of the HeaderName and
ReadmeName directives?

Prior to 1.3.9, you could use a directive such as
"HeaderName HEADER", and Apache would explicitly look
for HEADER, HEADER.html, and HEADER.txt.  With 1.3.8,
this is no longer explicit, which means that you either
have to specify the full name (e.g., HEADER.html) of
the file, or else enable Multiviews (e.g., with a
"Options +Multiviews" directive) for the directory being
indexed.

The plus side of the change is that *any* sort of text/*
file can be used for HeaderName and ReadmeName, and
text/html files can be parsed for server-side includes.

Please try either using a full filename in the directives,
or else enabling multiviews, and let me know the results.

 	The directives are as follows:
 
 - -----Begin excerpt from /usr/local/etc/apache139/conf/httpd.conf----
 
 <Directory "/usr/local/etc/http/htdocs">
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
     AllowOverride None
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
 </Directory>
 
 UserDir public_html
 DirectoryIndex index.html
 AccessFileName .htaccess
 IndexOptions FancyIndexing
 #
 # The server will first look for name.html and include it if found.
 # If name.html doesn't exist, the server will then look for name.txt
 # and include it as plaintext if found.
 #
 ReadmeName README
 HeaderName HEADER
 
 - -----End excerpt-----
 
 	To provide supporting information, here are the files' locations
 and permissions. 
 
 - -----Begin list of files (proof of proper permissions)-----

 	I believe I've got that covered, unless the latest Apache ver
 requires that the README/HEADER file contain a suffix of some kind.

 	Sounds good.  I'm just stumped as to why explicit declaration of
 the README/HEADER file name isn't being grokked here.

 	Roger that.  Here's the results thus far:
 
 	The following are comparative dumps via Lynx.  The first is with
 Apache v1.3.6 (bound to port 80).  The second is Apache v1.3.9 (bound to
 port 8080).  Both are reading the same directory.

This appears to be a problem with the "DefaultType text/plain"

by HeaderName and ReadmeName directives.  I'm looking into
this..
