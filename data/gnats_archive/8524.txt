>Release:        1.3.22
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional SP2 using Apache-supplied binary release (MSI setup program).
>Description:
The setup program incorrectly states I do not have TCP/IP configured or the Winsock 2 Update. Impossible, since this is Windows 2000 with two dial-up connections and a Ethernet NIC, all with TCP/IP bindings. Apache installs, but only in console mode. I selected to install as a service for all users. (This is not a problem with the 1.3.20 Win32 installer.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Run setup on Windows 2000 Professional. Disconnect from the network first (since my NIC is not connected to a network).
>Fix:
Correct the setup program.

 Where did you download the .msi from (dev.apache.org or www.apache.org?)
 What file did you download?  Please check the current release version
 at http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/ and report back,
 thanks!

 The file I downloaded is apache_1.3.22-win32-no_src.msi at
 http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/ with the date of 11-Oct-2001 08:37.
 This is the same date as the file currently there.
 
 The MSI file apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src-r2.msi works fine. Every time I
 run apache_1.3.22-win32-no_src.msi, it tells me erroneously that TCP/IP
 or Winsock2 is not installed and proceeds to install Apache in console
 mode (even though the option to install as service for all users was
 selected). I did complete the install of 1.3.22 and had to run apache -i
 to get the service installed. It runs fine. This is strictly a bug in
 the InstallScript.

That file has now been deleted.  Thank you for untangling these otherwise
confusing reports ;)  That file was moved by the RM, not the platform
maintainer, so I was terribly confused how folks kept finding the wrong
version!
