>Description:
I am running 1.2b4, and am trying to restrict access to individual
files, specifically all .pl, .pm, .htaccess and .htpasswd files.

The entry in access.conf is as follows:

<Files .htaccess .htpasswd *.pm *.pl>
   <Limit POST PUT GET>
      Order deny,allow
      deny from all
   </Limit>
</Files>

Apache barfs on this, complaining thusly:

Syntax error on line 26 of /home/web/apache/conf/access.conf:
order not allowed here

(line 26 is the 'Order deny,allow' line in the above snippet.

I assumed from reading the documentation that <File> worked the same way as
<Directory>, but the above example does not work
>How-To-Repeat:
See above example

State-Changed-Why:
Works fine for me with the latest snapshot.  Can you please
try with 1.2b6?  Note that you could simplify your syntax
to:
	<Files */*.pl>
	deny from all
	</Files>
The limit section is not needed.  Also note that you need
the */*.pl and not just *.pl.  Also note that there _does_
appear to be a bug in the handling of multiple files 
in the files directive; I will look into it.  For now,
using multiple files directives and only putting one
filename/wildcard per directive should work around that.

State-Changed-Why:
The <Files> directive is both documented and implemented
as taking only a single file name/pattern.  The problem
with "directive not available here" was fixed in 1.2b6.
I suggested to the user that he replace the <Files> line
with the following, and he reports that it works.

   <Files ~ "\.(htaccess|htpasswd|pm|pl)$">

It should be pointed out that this will keep CGI
scripts that end in these extensions from running
under certain (all?) circumstances.
