>Description:
I found the resolution in the FAQ on the java.apache.org site.  Very help full.  See:
http://java.apache.org/faq/fom-serve/cache/37.html for the resolution.

We stumbled on this error:  "you do not have DSO support" on doing the make or configure for JServ.

The resolution was not having Perl 5.0 on the server.  The server is completly new with nothing installed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use a clean machine w/o Perl 5.0.  Install Apache 1.3 with DSO support.  Try to install JServ with DSO support.  The error will occur due to not having Perl 5 loaded on the server.
>Fix:
The documenation on the README of the JSERV should probably have the requirements of needing Perl 5.0 on the requirements if using DSO support for the mod_jserv.so
