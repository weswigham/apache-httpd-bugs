>Description:
Using the mod_proxy as an ftp proxy with Lynx (ftp_proxy=http://proxy:8080/) 
I can navigate files/directories/view non-binary material OK. I can also
download files ending in .exe, .zip and so on, and are correctly reported as
application/x-msdos-executable etc. as per the /etc/mime.types file.

However, if I attempt to look at a file ending in .gz, it does not get
reported as a GZIP file. (Originally, I had no entry in the /etc/mime-types file,
but since adding in application/gzip gz it still fails).

Since the default transfer is for 'binary' I am suprised that the FTP proxy is reporting
it as 'text/plain' in its report.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Make a GZIP file
2) look at it through mod_proxy on vi an FTP server
>Fix:
Have the default mod_proxy transfer type report it as application/octet-stream instead of text/plain
for types that aren't registered?
