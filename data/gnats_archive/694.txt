LINUX ... downloaded the pre-compiled on Redhat distrobution which is the
same version and everything i have.
>Description:
I go to exec any cgi (even he script test-cgi that came with it) and i get :

Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

then i goto my error logs and this is what it says:

exec of /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/test-cgi failed, errno is 2
[Sat Jun  7 16:46:31 1997] access to /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/test-cgi failed for mikie.domain.com, reason: Premature end of script headers


>How-To-Repeat:
since my server is on my intranet you COULD point your proxies to
HTTP PROXY 158.222.2.14 port 80
SOCKS HOST 158.222.2.14 port 1080

and then goto the following URL  http://192.168.0.2/cgi-bin/test-cgi or http://192.168.0.2/cgi-bin/force.cgi

 Please send the output of the below command anyway.
 
 Also try compiling from source yourself.  There are so many potential
 incompatibilities on Linux due to a zillion versions of everything being
 around.
 
 As long as the server is running, it shouldn't matter who it runs as. 
 
 If compiling from source doesn't help. please send a copy of you *.conf
 files.

 Ah.  Your problem is probably end of line characters.  Windows likes an
 extra ^M that Unix doesn't.  If you vi one of the files copied from the
 Windows box, you will probably find that it has a ^M at the end of each
 line; most versions of vi will show it, some won't.  ISTR you can set
 Samba to automatically convert things like that, but it is ugly.
 
 Are you saying that test-cgi still doesn't work when you untar it directly
 on the Linux box?  It seems like you found the source of your problems, so
 if test-cgi still won't work that is probably related; you could try
 running it from the command line.
