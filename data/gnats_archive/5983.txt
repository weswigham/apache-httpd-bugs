>Description:
Downloded apache 1.3.12 and installed. Ran 'Install Apache as a service' from the start menu. Went to the service window in control panel, and tried to start the service and got the following message: Error 1067. The process terminated unexpectedly. There is nothing being log in the apache log directory, and there is nothing in the event viewer. Also tried to start as a console, and it just gives me about 1 second of a black screen. Same problem was logged before:#2803 in the bug database, however it does not give a clear solution.

Thank you
