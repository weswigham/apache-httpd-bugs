>Environment:
Sun Solaris, apache 1.2.1, Sun Pro (actually from what I have been told a 
old compiler, but haven't had previous problems.
>Description:
I have tried several approaches to restart the server without killing it 
completely and than restarting it with a new pid.  Again, non-critical but it 
used to work in previous release (not 1.2.0 but the release before that).
