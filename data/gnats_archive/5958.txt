>Environment:
This machine runs Slackware 7.0, Walnut Creek distro.  I have installed a few other systems using this same CD with no problems.

Linux www 2.2.13 #2 Mon Apr 3 18:29:15 PDT 2000 i686 unknown

>Description:
Following the same procedure I have done on several other boxes:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
make
make install

This will normally generate a fine, functioning apache server for me.  
I have not modified any of the conf files, also typical for how I begin an install.
This time, for some reason, all compiles and installs fine, but when I run 'apachectl start' I receive output that the server has successfully started.  However, 'ps ax' doesn't show any httpd running (there should be a parent and 5 children), and if i issues a 'apachectl stop' it tells me that the PID cannot be found. Trying to connect to the machine with lynx also does not work.
