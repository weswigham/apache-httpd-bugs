OS: FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE i386(No patch was applied)
Compiler: gcc-2.7.2.1
>Description:
  If DocumentRoot directive is set a path which has extra slash at end,
such as "/foo/bar/baz/", Directory/Location directive does not match correctly.
For Example, if DocumentRoot directive is set to '/foo/bar/baz/' and we
write,

  <Directory /foo/bar/baz/quux/>
    IndexIgnore foo
  </Directory>

to httpd.conf, IndexIgnore directive does not match to http://WebServer/quux/.
It's work correctly if DocumentRoot directive is set to '/foo/bar/baz'(No
last slash).  I think it may be specification, but, this behavior is not 
fail safe.

  Same thing is occurred if DOCUMENT_LOCATION is defined incorrectly.

This is a documented restriction.  Don't include trailing
slashes on the DocumentRoot and ServerRoot directive
values.  Thanks for using Apache!
