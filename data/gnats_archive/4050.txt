>Environment:
APACI configuration using --shadow
(generic problem)
>Description:
When doing a multi-platform configuration using --shadow, the configure
script generates a top level Makefile which is used on all platforms.

Unfortunately this Makefile contains a platform dependency, namely the
location of "awk" in this line:

GNUTRIPLE=`src/helpers/GuessOS | sed -e 's:/:-:g' | /bin/gawk '{ printf("%s",$$1); }'`

If awk is in a different location on other platforms, the make will not work.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --shadow

on two platforms in turn, where the location of the "best" awk on the
first system does not correspond to a working awk on the second.

My example is Digital Unix where /bin/nawk is chosen, followed by RedHat
Linux where /bin/nawk does not exist and /bin/gawk is best.
>Fix:
Try to avoid needing awk in the platform-independent bits?

 Actually the AWK script uses there should work under every AWK, so we can
 safely use "awk" here and not hard-code the best found one.  Fixed for Apache
 1.3.7. Thanks for your feedback.
