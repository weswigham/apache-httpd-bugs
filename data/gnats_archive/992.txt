>Description:
In trying to set up a "reverse" proxy server (proxying outside connections to 
internal machines), I was trying a line in the srm.conf like "ProxyPass /foobar 
http://foobar.foo.com" to mape foobar.foo.com to the directory /foobar on the 
proxy machine. This works okay in some situations and " http://proxy.foo.com/foobar"
will pull up the home page for foobar.foo.com.

However, I found that if a web page had links specified as 
"foo.gif", images and pages would load properly. If the link, however, specified
any kind of a path at all, without a hostname, like "/images/foo.gif", 
the images would not load. The links in the pages show that they are looking
for the images/pages in "proxy.foo.com/images" instead of 
"proxy.foo.com/foobar/images". Shouldn't the proxy rewrite these links to 
properly reflect the proxy server hierarchy? On static pages it it fine to specify
the static links, but it nice to organize graphics in their own directory, and 
on some CGI's to which I don't have source for, hard code the front "/".

Note that the "mod_rewrite" won't help me, since I have several internal hosts 
to do this to, and they may duplicate directories.

Thanks  
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Have the proxy server note that on a ProxyPass statement, the server needs to
rewrite embedded URL's to properly reflect the proxy/server relationship. 
Possibly simply removing the front "/" may do the trick, but that is just a 
guess

State-Changed-Why:

mod_proxy does not parse any webpages and there are no
plans to make mod_proxy do this.
If the pages you 'included' via ProxyPass include links
or images with an absolute path (starting with /) you
need to use ProxyPass for those URLs too.
(I recommend to use mod_rewrite for this purpose, because
 it is more flexible.)

I think it is no good idea to make mod_proxy parse and
rewrite the contents of the pages, because there are
people who rely on the fact the contents and the URLs are not
changed.

But thanks for your suggestion.
