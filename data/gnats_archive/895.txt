>Environment:
n/a
>Description:
The API does not provide a mechanism for modules to set ETags which are
processed by the precondition code currently in set_last_modified().
In particular, CGIs cannot play with ETags, and neither can mod_include.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Break the ETag/precondition code out of set_last_modified into a separate
set_etag() routine, and provide a default_etag() routine to generate the
default etag currently generated in set_last_modified()
