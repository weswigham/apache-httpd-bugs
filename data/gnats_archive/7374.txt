 Subject: bug while executing a dll in cgi-bin
 
 
 Hi,
 
 I'm trying to access a dll that is present in cgi-bin directory from a html
 file using post method.
 
 I'm not able to get the result page, but I get an error "Post method is not
 allowed". In the error log file I get the following error. Other files such
 as "JSP" executes well in cgi-bin directory and produces the result.
 
 Error: [Thu Mar 08 16:54:08 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] (2)No such file
 or directory: couldn't spawn child process:
 d:/programfilesoracle/ias/apache/apache/cgi-bin/talxisapi.dll
 
 Kindly let me know the solution
 
 Thanks
 Bhuvana
