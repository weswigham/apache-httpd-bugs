Windows 98
>Description:
Apache doesn't open, lock, or write to my log file anymore. It's approximately
830 Kbytes in size. I suspect this is a limitation with Windows 98, but I
don't know what exactly the problem is. I have 80 MB of RAM and a huge
swap file, so I doubt memory is the problem, but it simply seems to ignore
the file.

When I rename the file, Apache starts a new log file and writes to it as normal.
