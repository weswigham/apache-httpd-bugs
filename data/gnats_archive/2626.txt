>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
HP-UX 9.05 (Series 700 machine)
using HP's ANSI C compiler
>Description:
After a "make install", the <apachetree>/include installation directory
contains header files that don't have a+r permissions (i.e. 644). Instead
they only have u=rw permissions (i.e. 600).
>How-To-Repeat:
Only seems to happen on HP-UX 9.X. HP-UX 10.X seems OK. It appears that
the "umask 022" 'trick' doesn't work for that tree (not sure why - other
parts of the install tree look OK !).
>Fix:

Extend the code in the top-level Makefile.tmpl that copies the include files
(around line 326 or so) to:

	$(UMASK) 022; $(CP) $(TOP)/$(SRC)/$${osdir}/os.h $(root)$(includedir)/; \
	echo "chmod a+r $(includedir)/*.h"; \
	chmod a+r $(includedir)/*.h
	@echo "<=== [include]"
