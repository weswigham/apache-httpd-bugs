>Description:
  In future revisions of Apache, it would be nice for the mod_status
module to base it's results off of <VirtualHost>'s.

  Right now, if a <VirtualHost> is visited for /status information,
_ALL_ connections to Apache are returned -- for all <VirtualHost>s,
and for the main server.

  This functionality would be useful for system administrators who wish
to see information only regarding particular <VirtualHost>'s.

  This can currently be done by grabbing the results of the /status,
parsing them through a simple sh or perl script with grep functionality,
and then being spit back out. However, it would be much more wise to have
Apache grep the data out itself, since it already knows what connections
are going where.

State-Changed-Why:
I suggest you write this feature yourself if you want it.  You
have the power, you have the source.  And you've explained to
us how fast we should be able to write things, and how lazy we
are for not doing things for you immediately.

Enjoy your software.
