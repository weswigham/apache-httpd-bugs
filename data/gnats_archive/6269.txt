Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 SP3

>Description:
Here is a traceback for the initial crash:

ap_process_resource_config(server_rec * 0x00654a38, char * 0x006501d0, ap_directive_t * * 0x0063dd84, ap_pool_t * 0x00654130, ap_pool_t * 0x006765b4) line 1325 + 3 bytes
ap_read_config(process_rec * 0x0065211c, ap_pool_t * 0x006765b4, char * 0x006501d0, ap_directive_t * * 0x0063dd84) line 1588 + 25 bytes
apache_main + 680 bytes
main + 1673 bytes
mainCRTStartup() line 338 + 17 bytes
KERNEL32! bff8b560()

This problem is because an error handler is being called before all of the 
information has been set up.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Apache from its build directory e.g.:
cd CoreD
..\ApacheD\Apache

This is the message I get after the fix:
[Sun Jul 02 13:01:36 2000] [warn] Registry does not contain key SOFTWARE\Apache
Software Foundation\Apache\2.0a4
Syntax error on line 0 of (unknown):
Cannot load /apache/modules/ApacheModuleRewrite.dll into server: One of the libr
ary files needed to run this application cannot be found.
>Fix:
This change to src/main/http_config.c corrects it:

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Tue Sep  4 12:25:17 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This looks to be fixed in the latest CVS tree.  This was
tested by loading SSL into the server without the SSL
.DLL in the path, so that the library was not available
to the server.  The server reported the error correctly,
and did not seg fault.

Please re-test with a later version of Apache 2.0, and let
us know if this problem is not solved.
