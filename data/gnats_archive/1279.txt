>Description:
In the "Configuration.tmpl" file that is in src/ directory,
The documentation says (lines 20-22) that the Modules should
be listed in the "Configuration" file in priority order (w/ Highest 
priority first).

But at the end of file (lines 284-287), The documentation says
browser_module is the Highest priority and should be listed last.
