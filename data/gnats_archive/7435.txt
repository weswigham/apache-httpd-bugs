There seems to be a problem with the file descriptors (obviously).. I added..
set rlim_fd_max = 8192
set rlim_fd_cur = 4096
to /etc/system and everything.. I'm not sure what to try next.

getrlimit seems to be returning zero? so apache maybe defaults to 256? just a guess.

 Apparently stdio doesn't allow >256 on Solaris (Unless running 64-bit).
 
 So my options are to log to one large file and then parse them? Or maybe
 write something to tail the files and send them to the appropriate user.
 Anyone have other ideas?
 
 Oh well.

State-Changed-Why:

Yep, Solaris does have a file-descriptor limitation.
I'm not sure if there is any way around it other than
what you suggest, but you may want to inquire in a 
Solaris newsgroup.

Thanks for using Apache!
