>Environment:
OS/2 4 CSD 7
>Description:
I tried to install Apache on my OS/2 system but any emx 9.0c that I found is not
compatible cause reports versions 30..35 in almost all components, only two of
the files report the appropiate version. I had download emx 0.9c from Hobbes,
shareware.com, filepipe and other popular sites.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to find a compatible version for emx 0.9c
>Fix:
Post a updated version of emx. Can you send me one ?

Comment-Added:
Any v0.9c or later runtime dlls should work. Please supply
more information as to why you believe they don't. You
may have a much older revision elsewhere on your system.
