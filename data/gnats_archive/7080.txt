Repeatable on other 4.0g systems precisely.  Only warnings previous to this point.

pthread is a valid flag to DECUNIX ld so don't understand error.

NB we have run normal releases of Apache since its first development without difficulty (www.mcb.net).

>How-To-Repeat:
compile on a 4.0g dec system?
>Fix:
No but I am putting a full output from ./configure and make at our ftp site:
