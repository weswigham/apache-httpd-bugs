apache
>Environment:
linux 2.2.13 apache 1.3.12 oracle 8.1.6
Linux oraperf.chello.nl 2.2.13 #2 SMP Thu Nov 25 17:41:30 CET 1999 i686 unknown
>Description:
This happens only when you load a module that links Oracle as shared library.
The stacktrace is different, but start it as httpd -X in the debugger and you 
see that it tries to access an address that is no long mapped. info shared libraries
in gdb shows that the address is in the libpthread.so library. So make sure that
httpd is linked with libpthread.so.
>How-To-Repeat:
try to startup with the owa_module or php module that loads oracle as a DSO into 
apache.
>Fix:
apache/src/Makefile needs to have a fix for 
LIBS1=  -lm -lcrypt -lndbm -ldb -ldl       
to
LIBS1=  -lm -lcrypt -lndbm -ldb -ldl -lpthread
