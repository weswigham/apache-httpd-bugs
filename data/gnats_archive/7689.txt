>Description:
my problem was: setting a local proxy to joke a friend so that he couldn't get - *randomly* - a page;

I've worked with mod_rewrite in this way (shortened and out of peculiarities):

snippet from httpd.config
----
RewriteEngine on
RewriteLog logs/rewrite.log
RewriteLogLevel 5
RewriteMap map1 rnd:conf/map1.txt
RewriteCond ${map1:random10} ^1$
RewriteRule (testcond$) ??x1
----


the map map1.txt is
----
random10  1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10
----

but in this way I always get the first case ("1" or whatever I put as first case)



note:
1)I also submitted this on the new-httpd list some weeks ago but got no answer;
2)the httpd compiled from the 2.0.14a tree *crashes* with this config. (I think in do_expand)



>How-To-Repeat:
you can test repeatedly on a local URL such as
http://127.0.0.1/testcond and check the rewrite.log file

since this is probabilistic you can also modify the map1.txt adding a large number of possibilities;

I've tryed more than 50 times with 100 cases (choices) and got ever the first (that's enough..)


>Fix:
I've got it to work only replacing the call to rand() with a locally-implemented function mt_rand()  (eg. from http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/matumoto/)

or, at first with something like  sin(time()) as raw random generator
