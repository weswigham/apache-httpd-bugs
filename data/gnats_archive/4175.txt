>Description:
I have a simple Perl script that is SUID to another user (UID=5000), that is called via mod_perl in /perl.

If I call this script from the command line, it changes UID (and when I print $< and $> on the command line they are different).

When called via http://localhost/perl/script.pl, it ignores the SUID, without any errors. The effective & real ID are identical when checked in the script.

Why?

I recompiled Apache with suEXEC, but it didn't help and it's not the problem, since normal SUID scripts should run with suEXEC? suEXEC is not *user* directory SUID, no?

In httpd, /perl is as follows:
## Configure mod_perl
<Location /perl>
        #AllowOverride None
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::Registry
        Options ExecCGI
        allow from all
        PerlSendHeader On
</Location>

No. Perhaps I've misunderstood something? I did check all doc, bug reports etc, but found no mention of this.

Thanks in advance,

State-Changed-Why:
First, this has nothing to do with Apache but rather mod_perl.

Second, of course setuid scripts can't be run as a different
user by mod_perl.  That is part of the whole idea; the perl
interpreter is inside Apache, so there is no seperate process
to be run that can be setuid.

 Hmm. I though it could simply change it's UID with $< $> and change back,
 only being allowed to do that if the SUID was in place.
 
 So what solution do you suggest? How might I fork a proces and change the ID
 so that I can call this SUID script? [Sorry if this seems obvious to you..]
 
 Thanks in advance,
 
 Sean
