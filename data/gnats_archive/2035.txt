Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi - or, if your browser
isn't forms-capable, you can send them via email to
apache-bugs@apache.org. If you don't wish to do the port
yourself, please submit this output rather than the patches.
Thank you
