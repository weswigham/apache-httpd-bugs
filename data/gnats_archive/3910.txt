>Description:
I had reported this bug before (PR#3575).

The answer I got describes a new behavior that states when the 100-Continue
shouldn't be sent. However, 100-Continue isn't being sent anymore while
doing a PUT.

I checked back with Henrik Frystyk and he agrees this is a bug in Apache.

>How-To-Repeat:
Install mod_put or a PUT script -- the bug doesn't depend on the PUT being
implemented by a module or by a CGI script.
Then try something like:

================================
PUT /test.html HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: deflate
TE: trailers,deflate
Expect: 100-continue
Host: tuvalu:7990
If-Match: "3f9f5-14aa-36add0b9"
User-Agent: amaya/V1.4a libwww/5.2.1
Connection: TE
Date: Tue, 26 Jan 1999 14:28:23 GMT
Allow: PUT
Content-Length: 10
Content-Type: text/html
=========
or even simpler like:

=========
PUT /test.html HTTP/1.1
Expect: 100-continue
Host: tuvalu:7990
Content-Length: 10
Content-Type: text/html
==============

You won't get any 100-Continue. In fact, Apache is already waiting for your data.
If you type it in, it'll get PUT'ed.
>Fix:
Apache initiallty detects the Expect: 100-Continue header and sets up
an internal flag (expecting_100) in a request_rec variable (let's say r).
However, later on down the pipeline, there's a call  
http_request.c:internal_internal_redirect() where a new request_rec
variable is created (new_uri). Several fields of r are copied to new_uri,
however this is not the case of expecting_100.

Later on, there's a call to
http_protocol.c:ap_should_client_block() where Apache decides
whether it should send the 100-Continue answer. As
r->expecting_100 (in fact, it's
new_uri->expecting_100 which was initialized above)
is always zero, the 100-Continue won't be sent.

Note that the expecting_100 flag is correctly copied in
http_protocol.c:ap_set_sub_req_protocol. My guess is that it was just
missing on the internal_internal_redirect().

SOLUTION

I added a line to copy  the status of r->expecting_100 to
new_uri->expecting_100.

After applying my patch, I could get a 100-Continue answer while making a
POST or a PUT. When trying to do so with a HEAD or GET request, I
didn't get any 100-Continue, as Roy's overrode this header (as
expected :)). 

I didn't push the tests to see how it works while using a proxy.

I hope that this modest contribution is helpful to the Apache team.

Cheers,

-Jose
