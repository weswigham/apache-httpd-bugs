>Environment:
I'm using the compiled binary (no C compiler) under NT 4.0 service pack 3
>Description:
I am executing the print_hit_bold program that accompanies the Swish search engine. It requires a URL in the form of:

http://localtest.ipmaac.org/cgi-shl/print_hit_bold.pl/acn/apr96/hmpg.html?web#first_hit

This works fine on my Best/HTTTPd hosted server, and on my local test server under O'Reilly's Website Pro. Under the Apache Beta, though, I get a "connection reset by peer" error when accessing via Netscape 4 or MSIE 4.

(Note: it works without the ? and following info, but the script doesn't function optimally).

In the server log, I get:
file .\main\util_script.c, line 756, assertion "0" failed

Hope this helps!
>How-To-Repeat:
I could send the script for testing, if it would help. Unfortunately, my apache server is not internet-connected; I use it for local testing. The "live" site where the script works can be seen using, for example:

http://www.ipmaac.org/cgi-shl/print_hit_bold.pl/acn/apr96/hmpg.html?web#first_hit

 I'm looking into why the assert is there, but in the meantime, you can
 fudge around the problem by including a dummy argument with an "=" in
 it:
 
 ...?web&x=y#first_hit
 
 if your script doesn't mind, that is.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Ben.
