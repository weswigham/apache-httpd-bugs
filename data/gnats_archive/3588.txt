>Description:
when i try to run a script the server send me a http 500 error.
My log file say

exec of xxxx failed, errno is 2
acces to xxx failed for xx.xxx.com.ar , reason :Premature end of script headers

My question is :

 my configurations file are bad?, my script is bad?, whats up?

my acces.conf file say:

<directory /var/lib/httpd/htdocs/cgi-bin>
options indexes followsymlinks
allowoverride all
options followsymlinks indexes execcgi
<limit GET POST PUT>
  order allow,deny
 allow from all
</limit>
</directory>

my srm.conf say :
 
Scriptalias /cgi-bin/ /var/lib/httpd/htdocs/cgi-bin/

and the httpd.conf 
 
   user nobody
   group # -1


Users should be able to: 

              run cgi script on cgi-bin directory from any servers


Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
First, 1.1 is a very obsolete version of Apache.  As we clearly
state, we can't support such obsolete versions.

It appears like this is completely and entirely due to you not
creating your CGI properly.  Ensure you can run it from the
command line and it prints out the proper headers.  If you
don't know how to make a CGI, this is not the place to be trying
to figure that out.  I suspect that the first #! line
in the script is pointing to a program that doesn't exist on
your system.
