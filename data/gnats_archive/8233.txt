State-Changed-Why:

No bug there.  These files exists for some complicated
reasons involving langauge negotiation and multiviews.

Unfortunately, it is no longer very easy to browse
the docs through the filesystem.  You will need to
access them through your server with MultiViews
turned on.  Then Apache will deal with the file
extension mess for you.

Thanks for using Apache!
