 Dear Investor,
  
 We would like to invite you to look at Cetalon Corp.  
 (CETA : OTCBB)  Cetalon is a great investment opportunity in 
 the natural vitamins, minerals, and supplements industry.  The
 company has a unique relationship with Sears (S), which allows
 the company to operate within Sears retail stores and enjoy
 unique locations on Sears' mainstream sales floors.  A small
 float of approx. 1 million shares will surely drive demand for
 the company's stock.  Read below for the complete profile.
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  FINANCIAL DATA:
 
 - Shares Outstanding: 5,500,000
 - Float (Est): 1,000,000
 - 52 week High: $5.00
 - 52 week Low: $0.85

 +>+>+>  ABOUT CETALON CORPORATION - (CETA : OTCBB)
 
 Cetalon is a "Store within a store" retail and direct marketing
 company specializing in the sale of natural vitamins, minerals,
 and supplements as well as health information technologies and
 home health care products.  Cetalon is licensed to operate within
 Sears retail stores and enjoy unique locations on Sears'
 mainstream sales floors - which is a first for Sears which
 normally places licensees around the perimeter of their stores,
 or in separate locations/buildings entirely.  Cetalon operates in
 46 Canadian locations in Sears retail stores and have recently
 opened in 10 California stores under the name Sears Health and
 Nutrition Centers - five shops are in Southern California and
 five shops are in Northern California.   These will act as
 prototypes for the Sears U.S. market. 
 
 
 Cetalon's business model forecasts a rapid expansion into
 department stores in the US with products from leading
 manufacturers plus a full line of specialty formulated products
 to sell under the Company's private brand. The best-trained and
 motivated specialists in the industry will provide superior
 customer service through our partner retailers full line stores,
 taking advantage of their advertising and logistical support. 
 The Company also has an alliance with Innovative Botanical
 Solutions, a company with a global reputation for innovative
 products and superior quality, to supply its private label brand.
 
 
 These factors coupled with Sears' 63 million strong consumer
 base, with a target market of nearly 50% represented, should
 bring Sears Health and Nutrition Centers to profitability within
 a relatively rapid timeframe, as per the following: 
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  COST FOCUS
 
 * Sears Health & Nutrition Centers has been appointed as the sole
 Health & Fitness licensee of Sears,  Canada & U.S.A. 
 
 * Sears Corporation will fund all build-outs on behalf   of Sears
 Health & Nutrition Centers 
 
 * Sears is contracted to sweep each register and close out the
 daily books of Sears Health & Nutrition Centers. Sears handles
 all aspects of collection,  cash security, credit card processing
 and accounting control 
 
 * Sears Health & Nutrition Centers will benefit from low fixed
 operating expenses, with no fixed minimum.  This includes
 electricity and all utilities.  Also corporate support such as
 (volume discounts,  telephone, postage, advertising expenses) 
 can be leveraged to reduce expenses 
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  SUMMARY
 
 With Sears' 63 million strong customer base and a booming health
 and nutrition market - look for Cetalon to add stores and
 increase sales, revenue and shareholder value.  This is a company
 on the move!
