>Environment:
NT4 SP3, JServ 1.0b from around the first week of August.
>Description:
JServ doesn't handle slash and backslash path delimiters consistently. Apache config file says to use forward slashes, e.g., for the JServLogFile. Using forward slashes writes the correct log file from the C code (I think it's the C code) of the module, but writes a file to an incorrect location from the Java code. For instance,

JServLogFile d:/applications/apache/logs/jserv.log

creates two files, one in d:/applications/apache/logs/jserv.log and another d:/applicationsapachelogsjserv.log. Both files end up containing only part of the full jserv log.

There are related problems in the jserv.properties file. Here, the wrapper.classpath parameters must use backslash path delimiters, while the other paths, such as the paths to the zone property files, must use forward slashes.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure apache jserv on an NT box.
>Fix:
Accept forward slashes for all paths for consistency with Apache config files. Also accept backslashes for consistency with Windows conventions. Paths should be translated to whatever internal form Java is expecting (probably backslash delimited).

Comment-Added:
Is this still a problem, with recent snapshots?  If so,
I'll try to get someone to work on this (I don't have the
software to try to set up JServ on NT).
