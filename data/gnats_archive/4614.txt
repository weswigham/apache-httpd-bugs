asgard# uname -a
BSD/OS asgard.ttsg.com 4.0.1 BSDI BSD/OS 4.0.1 Kernel #4: Fri Feb 19 11:52:44 MST 1999     polk@demiurge.BSDI.COM:/home/polk/tmp/sys/compile/GENERIC  i386
asgard# gcc -v
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
When doing a httpd -h, it does not show "[-D name]" in the
"Usage:" section.

asgard# ./httpd -h
Usage: ./httpd [-d directory] [-f file]
               [-C "directive"] [-c "directive"]
               [-v] [-V] [-h] [-l] [-L] [-S] [-t]
Options:
  -D name          : define a name for use in <IfDefine name> directives
  -d directory     : specify an alternate initial ServerRoot
  -f file          : specify an alternate ServerConfigFile
  -C "directive"   : process directive before reading config files
  -c "directive"   : process directive after  reading config files
  -v               : show version number
  -V               : show compile settings
  -h               : list available command line options (this page)
  -l               : list compiled-in modules
  -L               : list available configuration directives
  -S               : show parsed settings (currently only vhost settings)
  -t               : run syntax test for configuration files only
>How-To-Repeat:
httpd -h
>Fix:
In http_main.c 

Line 981 :

    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s [-R directory] [-d directory] [-f file]\n", bin);
becomes

    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s [-R directory] [-D name] [-d directory] [-f file]\n", bin);

Line 983:

    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s [-d directory] [-f file]\n", bin);
becomes
    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s [-d directory] [-D name] [-f file]\n", bin);
