This is a strange one.

When called from mod_include, but not mod_cgi, call_exec can't proceed
past getpwnam() in the suexec_enabled-guarded part.  Changing the
serialization type fixes this.

I've tried both ``exec cmd'' and ``exec cgi''.  When the former is called
before the latter, truss outputs:

For ``exec cmd'':

However, calling ``exec cgi'' before ``exec cmd'' produces different
results.  The ``exec cgi'' fails as above, but the ``exec cmd'' works.
[Yes, I know, ``exec cgi'' is not the prefered method, but I'm using it
to test my suexec.]

The death is definitely within getpwnam().  Calling getpwnam() elsewhere 
in the routine moves the point-of-death.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with the defaults and suexec.  Bang head against wall many times.
>Fix:
I wish I knew.  Using fcntl rather than the Solaris mutexes works.
I'll let you know if I uncover more

 I'm going to suggest to everyone we disable pthreads mutexes... there's
 enough anecdotal evidence that they're not quite reliable enough.  It'll
 become an option for advanced users only... folks willing to experiment
 for speed.

 Changing the defaults is probably the best thing for now.  If I find
 out anything more about this problem, I'll pass it along.
 
 One thing I forgot to note in the PR:  I tried this both with and
 without _REENTRANT.  I also tried changing getpwnam() to getpwnam_r()
 with the same results.  Random guesses, and they didn't help.
