>Description:
Follow-up to #2751 -- I have the same problem using Apache JServ (0.9.11) with Apache 1.3.3

The config settings are:
AddHandler dtl-servlet .dtl
Action dtl-servlet /cgi/dtl

The error messages are:
[Thu Nov  5 16:08:02 1998] [warn] [client 144.92.125.148] handler "dtl-servlet" not found for: /highwire/journals/jbc/html/help/errors/unavailable.dtl

The file actually comes up fine; the error message is spurious.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
We temporarily fixed this by removing the following code (http_config.c, line 512)

<     if (result == NOT_IMPLEMENTED && r->handler) {
<         ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_NOERRNO|APLOG_WARNING, r,
<             "handler \"%s\" not found for: %s", r->handler, r->filename);
<     }

Presumably this code is there for a reason, of course...
