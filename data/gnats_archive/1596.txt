State-Changed-When: Wed Dec 24 05:27:20 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:

The messages do not indicate an error or a problem unless
you see _very_ much of those messages in your error log.

The messages are caused by clients breaking the
connection, by buggy clients (you will see those
messages when a client with broken PDF support tries
do download PDF files from your site, i.e. byte-serving)
and by clients accessing your site via an extremely
slow connection.

But how many of those messages do you see and how many hits
get your server?
