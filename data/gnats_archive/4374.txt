>Description:
At least once a week (not including the once a week cron job I'm now running) 
I have to reboot the server due to slow proxy response, and hung jobs.

I run the ../bin/apachectl stop 

but sometimes after I run this there are still httpd processes running.  
Initially they will be running off of the "killed" httpd process, but then 
they will be showing as children of the system process "1".

When I try to do a kill -9 <pid> there is no response, and then I cannot start
httpd, because it shows that port 80 is already "occupied."  This results in 
me having to do a reboot of the server which really is not a good fix or 
work-a-round.  

Any help on this matter would be GREATLY appreciated.  This is really starting
to be a real problem for me.

Another thing I noticed was that most of the http child processes show time stamps 
of a pretty recent hour, but the ones that won't die tend to be very "old" 
processes, sometimes hours but most of the time days.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I need to find a way to unconditionally kill these hung processes, and release
control over port 80.

State-Changed-Why:

Do you use any custom modules?
Do you know in what situations the segmentation fault
occurs (can you reproduce it)?

 No custom modules in place.
 
 The segmentation fault happens periodically while the server is up and running.  
 As I mentioned in the initial report, I will see jobs that have never released 
 for over a period of time, and these jobs will not die, even after the initial 
 pid has been killed.
 
 In other words, it is reproduced constantly.  Although I don't know what is 
 happening to hold the specific jobs in their "open" state.

 At this point the server is in a basic stop state, and is running jobs.  So if I 
 reboot the machine it will cause major problems.
 
 If I could just somehow take over control of the port and make these jobs 
 "belong" somewhere else it would be so helpful.
 
 
 I hope this gives you some more information to go on.
 
 HELP!!  Please,
