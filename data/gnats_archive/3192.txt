>Description:
I am using following perl-script for rewriting.

$| = 1;
open (ERR,">/tmp/my-debug-log");
while (<STDIN>) {
    print ERR "IN:$_\nOUT:";
    print $Calculated{$_} ||= calculate($_); # calculate and store the result for future use
    print ERR $Calculated{$_} ||= calculate($_);
    print "\n";
    print ERR "\n";
}

The calculate it not quite simple and rather slow, but there is a unique mapping from URL to filename.

When I look at my-debug-log, every input line is converted correctly. But apache seems to mess up the results given.

From httpd.conf:
 RewriteEngine On
 RewriteLog "logs/rewrite.log"
 RewriteMap rw prg:/pi/bin/rewrite
 RewriteRule /~.*       -       [L]
 RewriteRule /icons/.*  -       [L]
 RewriteRule /cgi-bin/.*        -       [L]
 RewriteRule /(.*) /${rw:%{HTTP_HOST};;;$1}         

Some times apache messes up input too:
Correct syntax is: http_host;;;path_excluding_/
Incorrect syntax: http_host;;;path_excluding_/http_host
                  ;;;path_excluding_/

That is: apache sends the correct syntax, but mixes it with the next request.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Since the problem only occurs if many requests are sent simultanously (e.g. 4 frames with pictures)
I would assume the problem is in serializing the requests to/from the rewrite-program.

 Did you try adding a RewriteLock directive as the docs instruct?

 Yes. No change.
 
 Another remark: When the path has been calculated I cache it for future
 use. This means that after a few reloads the page will show up correctly. 
 This appears to be because the program answers quickly.

State-Changed-Why:

You say that you only see the problem under load...
How much requests (approx.) does your server
receive in such a situation.

Are you sure that this is no perl problem/bug?
