>Environment:
Using apache-ssl_1.3.12.1+1.40-2.deb from Debian on Linux 2.2.14.
>Description:
In apache config file:

  DirectoryIndex index.cgi

In .htaccess file in DocumentRoot:

  <FilesMatch "\.cgi$">
    AuthType basic
    AuthName admin
    AuthUserFile /what/ever/passwd
    <Limit GET POST>
      require valid-user
    </Limit>
  </FilesMatch>

Then "GET / HTTP/1.0" returns a 401 without a WWW-Authenticate header, whereas
"GET /index.cgi HTTP/1.0" returns a 401 with such a header.  So the FileMatch
directive does match to produce a 401 when using the DirectoryIndex feature to
add the file to the end of the URL, but it somehow forgets to add in the extra
header when doing this.  On the client end Netscape seems to handle this, but
IE doesn't.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try it yourself!
>Fix:
Nope, sorry I haven't got time to look at the apache source code to work out
where the problem is.
