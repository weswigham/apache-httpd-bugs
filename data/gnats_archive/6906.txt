>Description:
I have, on my LAN, an Outlook Webmail server. If somebody try to connect to this server, there is no problem. But, if somebody try to connect to this server via my APACHE (http / https proxy), user who are under MSIE4 or MSIE5 can't download their attachments files. So, user who are under Netscape 4 have no problem. I don't found any topic about this problem. Can you help me ?

Aymeric.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using one OWA server and one APACHE reverse proxy. When any client who are unsing MSIE4 ou MSIE5 try connect to the OWA server by using APACHE proxy, they can't download any e-mail attachments.
