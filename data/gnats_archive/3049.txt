>Environment:
FreeBSD-Unix 2.2.7 Stable
>Description:
I want to keep my logfiles small, so i started to handle the logfiles 
via newsyslog to rotate and compress them. Newsyslog writes a messag in the 
first line, that logfiles had been turned over....
After that action (if new logfile is created) apache stops logging events.
Even a stop and restart does not help. If you clean the line made by newsyslog
everything works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
just rotate the logfiles of a runing apache with newsyslog 
>Fix:
is there a parsingsequence ???
