>Description:
With a rule like:

ScriptAliasMatch ^/(.*)/_vti_bin/ /web/user1/html/$1/_vti_bin/

and a URI input
/king/_vti_bin/shtml.exe

we expect a match and a translation to /web/user1/html/king/_vti_bin/shtml.exe

However the code returns /web/user1/html/king/_vti_bin/
and then server errors with trying to execute dir as a script

The problem is in util.c in pregsub, it fails to account for the
remaining portion of "source" which falls outside of the pattern matched.

>How-To-Repeat:
yes
>Fix:
I patched util.c, pregsub() however I'm now a bit worried some other code
depends on this errant behaviour.  Maybe I should have patched mod_alias instead.

I think you want something like this:

  ScriptAliasMatch ^/(.*)/_vti_bin/(.*) /web/user1/html/$1/_vti_bin/$2

 It still is an odd difference between how normal regex substitution
 happens (i.e. vi, sed, perl) and how we do it in apache.  But it makes
 sense for apache because most replacements want to replace the entire
 source.

 So you're suggesting the fix should be in mod_alias - attach the
 remainder of the URI after the regex-sub?  The other branches of
 the code does just that (gets the length of the match and then
 concatenates the remainder after alias substitution).

 No actually I'm suggesting that your configuration is wrong, or maybe our
 docs are just not specific enough.  All of our regex replacements are
 complete replacements... unlike sed/vi/perl which only replace the portion
 of the string that actually matched.  Lars sent an example which should do
 what you want.
