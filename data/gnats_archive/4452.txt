>Environment:
Redhat Linux 6.0, Blackdown JDK 1.1.7v3, InstantDB 2.2
>Description:
InstantDB (www.instantdb.co.uk) is a Java database engine.  I've created my own
database and can access it via the tools included in the distribution.

The url for the driver looks like so: jdbc:idb:/path/to/properties.prp.  This
properties file contains (strangely enough!) properties that define the location
of various files and directories.  By default (and unchanged by myself) they
exist in the same directory as the properties file.  The properties look like:

traceFile=./trace.log

tablePath=./tables

indexPath=./index

tmpPath=./tmp

systemPath=./system


specifying a relative path to these files & directories - they are all in the
same directory as the properties file.  When I try to create a connection to 
the database via my servlets, the following occurs:

java.sql.SQLException: IO problem: java.io.FileNotFoundException: ./trace.log
	at db.Trace.setExport(Trace.java)
	at db.Database.initialise(Database.java)
	at db.Database.dbOpen(Database.java)
	at jdbc.idbConnection.<init>(idbConnection.java)
	at jdbc.idbDriver.connect(idbDriver.java)
	at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:83)
	at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:141)

I have explicity defined the path with the same results.  I'm certain that the
installation of InstantDB is correct as I can access my database using their 
tools.  I'm fairly certain that my JServ properties are correct as my servlets
are working.

Using JRun with Apache on NT with the same code, all works as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
The only way to investigate this is to download & install InstantDB, write a 
quick servlet & test.  InstantDB comes with a sample database that is quickly
installed & would be good to test with.

 You do not specify how you are starting the java portion of Apache JServ, is
 manual on or off?
 
 Having it work on NT is something totally different than having it work on
 Unix. Have you tried it with Apache JServ on NT? I bet that it will work.
 
 Here is one answer that you are probably looking for in terms of figuring
 out how to solve your problem:
 
 <http://java.apache.org/faq/fom-serve/cache/150.html>
 
 This really is not a bug in Apache JServ, it is a configuration issue on
 your part. If you have further questions, I suggest that you subscribe to
 the Java Apache Users mailing list. I will be closing this bug report.
