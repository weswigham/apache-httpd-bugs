>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Solaris 5.7, gcc, tomcat 3.2 with mod_jk
>Description:
When using Apache 1.3.14 with Tomcat 3.2 and mod_jk, the DirectoryIndex does not get passed to Tomcat for processing.

Apache 1.3.14 - httpd.conf 
...
DirectoryIndex index.jsp
...
include /usr/local/tomcat/conf/mod_jk.conf

mod_jk.conf

LoadModule jk_module libexec/mod_jk.so
JkWorkersFile /usr/local/tomcat/conf/workers.properties
JkLogFile /usr/local/tomcat/logs/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel debug
JkMount /*.jsp ajp12

Note: if JkMount /* ajp12 is used, index.jsp is displayed but all apache security is ignored and all content is served from Tomcat (very slow).
>How-To-Repeat:
Behind firewall on non-visible system.
>Fix:
Software bug between Apache and mod_jk.  I have also tried different module loading orders... making sure mod_jk.c is loaded before mod_dir etc.  No luck.
