It seems that the latest Version of NCR-Unix SVR$ MP-RAS 3.02 
has the same Problem than Solaris and Unixware 1.0 (see below)


 /* Solaris (probably versions 2.4, 2.5, and 2.5.1 with various levels
  * of tcp patches) has some really weird bugs where if you dup the
  * socket now it breaks things across SIGHUP restarts.  It'll either
  * be unable to bind, or it won't respond.

The Problem has not been seen on previous Versions of MP-RAS

unfortunatly not

a very rudimental fix in http_main.c
May not not be the best solustion but it worked

If compiling under NCR Unix MP-RAS 3.02 
after 

#if defined (UW) && UW < 200
#define WORKAROUND_SOLARIS_BUG
#endif

add the following

#if defined SVR4
#define WORKAROUND_SOLARIS_BUG
#endif

Hi.  We received a bug report from John Withers <withers@semi.kcsc.mwr.irs.gov>
with a patch for this very platform in the last few weeks.
1.3b7, when released, includes this patch; however the patch
originally was against 1.2.6, so it's possible that something
in the 1.3 vein is triggering this bug you're proposing this
fix to.  I suggest you pull down the current CVS snapshot from
http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/ and give it a try; let us know
if this bug still persists.  Obviously, it's going to be better
to conditionalize the fix with an #ifdef MPRAS rather than
an #ifdef SVR4.  Thanks.

 Hello,
 
 Thanks for your response.
 I loaded the latest release form your server. (1.3b8-dev)
 But after compiling ist ended up with the problem mentioned below.
 
 The following fixes solved the problem on MPRAS.
 please note, it is actually not advisable to check for MPRAS, sinde GuessOS returns i486-ncr-sysv4 on all NCR systems running under SVR4.
 
 Furthermore i suggest to change the Commentlength in the mod_autoindex.c from 23 to e.g. 73. this gives a more comprehensive output.
 
 Below you find a diff output of the changed modules.

 I'd like to apply your patch, but I'm confused.  It seems that you're
 changing behaviour for all NCR SVR4 systems rather than just the MPRAS
 system that you say has the problem.  Maybe you could improve GuessOS to
 return more information if you need it to distinguish between different
 NCR systems?
 
 Or, does the problem exist in all NCR systems?
 
 Thanks
 Dean

[Attaching misdirected mail message.]

Dean,

1. starting with MP-RAS 2.2 all NCR Unix Systems using the same Operating 
System BASE OS Software.

2. I noticed the Problem only on the latest MP-RAS Release 3.02  (this is 
the Y2K certified)

3. Cause every Customer should upgrade to 3.02 ist should not lead to 
Problems

4. We are differentiate the Hardware platform by using either the  'uname 
-m' or the  /usr/sbin/machinetype command. since there are many options to 
this command i attached the output of machinetype -k for your information.

Product="NCR Globalyst S40 Model 3438"
Model=3438
Class=3438
Level=LEVEL4
Processors=2
CPUid=0
CPU="Pentium"
Speed=100
CPUid=1
CPU="Pentium"
Speed=100
Boot=0
Dump=SUSDUMP
RBIOS=NO
EISA_PCI_Bus=yes

5. If you think i should modify GuessOS and implement machinetype please 
let me know.


regards

Klaus
