FreeBSD raw.webguide.nl 2.2.2-RELEASE FreeBSD 2.2.2-RELEASE #0: Wed Nov 26 12:59:56 CET 1997  /i386
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
All sites point to the DocumentRoot as setted in the last <VirtualHost>

My httpd.conf is like this:


<VirtualHost wow.rrm.net>
Servername wow.rrm.net
DocumentRoot /home/rrm/wow
</VirtualHost>

Listen 195.109.88.64:80

ServerAlias www.rrm.net

in srm.conf the DocumentRoot is setted to the general DocumentRoot.

Summarizing:
wow.rrm.net is a CNAME for rrm.net
wow.rrm.net should point to directory ~rrm/wow, as setted in the VirtualHost directive
rrm.net should point to directory ~rrm/www as setted as the main DocumentRoot directive
rrm.net now goes to wow.rrm.net
>How-To-Repeat:
Faulty config not running right now
>Fix:
no idea :%2

 This config worked before?  In what version of the server?  If it was
 working in 1.2 and you just upgraded to 1.3 then please read the
 upgrading_to_1_3.html documentation, and specifically please read the new
 vhosts documentation -- you may need to update your configuration.
 
 If you can, provide a small example configuration that shows the problem.

 This is why I don't believe in spam filters -- email should work, it
 shouldn't go through complex error-prone filtering.  Tough luck Thies
 Edeling, your site is messed up and well, I can't talk with you so I'm
 going to close this out.
