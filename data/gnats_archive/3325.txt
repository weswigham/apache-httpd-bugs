State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid that if you can't give us more information
than that, we really can't help you.

How are your vhosts configured?  Show the exact directives
used.  What do you expect to see?  What exactly do 
you see?  What do you mean by "ServerName page"?  Every
vhost has a ServerName.

If you are using name based virtual hosts, then you are
aware, as the documentation states quite cleary, that
if you have a NameVirtualHost directive then the 
first vhost will be used for all nonmatching requests
for that IP?
