>Description:
I use the proxy on apache 1.3.22 running on a linux box as a way of allowing
other local machines to share the internet connection for web usage only.

Although it the past this has worked fine I am now having problems logging
onto hotmail using internet explorer 5.0 (on win98SE). While chasing this down 
I also found Konqueror 2.2.1 has the same problem.

It seems the https CONNECT request is made using an HTTP/1.1 format header - I
presume this was HTTP/1.0 until recently. Apache rejects such requests as 
improperly formatted. I have tried accessing the same sites (via apache proxy)
using a simple telnet session and it works for HTTP/1.0 but not for HTTP/1.1.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above
>Fix:
My local fix is as follows:
module http_protocol.c, lines 1177..1179

Replace:

    if ((!r->hostname && (r->proto_num >= HTTP_VERSION(1,1))) ||
        ((r->proto_num == HTTP_VERSION(1,1)) &&
         !ap_table_get(r->headers_in, "Host"))) {

With:

    if ((!r->hostname && (r->proto_num >= HTTP_VERSION(1,1))) &&
        ((r->proto_num == HTTP_VERSION(1,1)) &&
         !ap_table_get(r->headers_in, "Host"))) {

The comment seems to imply that the host name must be sent EITHER with a full
URL or Host: header. The code however requires both. My change relaxes this 
condition.

IE-5.0 & Konqueror 2.2.1 both send the full URL but do not (seem to) send
Host: headers

It may be that this is design intent and HTTP/1.1 should have both a full URL
and host: headers. Your call.
