**** EXEC FUNCTION FAILED: subsys =517; info = 48
ABORT: /APACHE/PUB/apache_1.3.9/src/main/gen_uri_delims
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The problem comes from the fact that these programs were linked with PM 
capability and programs with PM capability can only be executed from the
MPE name space. MPE is unable to determine if a program is authorized to 
execute with PM capability while in the posix shell. 

Neither of these programs require PM capability. They will execute just fine 
with the default linker options. Only the main process, which needs to obtain
socket address 80, needs PM capability.

Suggest you remove linker option from gen_test_char and gen_uri_delims and
allow them to link with defaults.
