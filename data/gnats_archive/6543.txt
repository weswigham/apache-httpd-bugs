>Description:
Hi,
when i have upgraded from apache 1.3.9 to apache 1.3.12 i was surprised.
If i request non-existent php3 script, i not receive server response 404 Not Found,
but error message from php. First my think was, that is fault of php, but was used php 3.0.16
with apache 1.3.9. Next i have same problem with perl scripts. So i assume, that is some mistake
in apache source or undocumented "feature" not mentioned i CHANGES.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any compiled apache 1.3.12 (not my, because is patched)
then use CGI version of php3
in http.conf put
AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .phtml
Action application/x-httpd-php3 /cgi-bin/php3
restart the apache
php3 module must be disabled, this error gets only when action is set to external program or script.
not with internal handlers.

now request non-existent php3 script 
exam
http://tested.server.dom/non-existent.php3

same effect you may get with perl scripts handled not by mod_perl, but perl directly
or some other external program parsed scripts.

>Fix:
I have compared source of mod_mime (that handles AddHandler directive) and mod_actions
(that handles Action directive). And i found the problem. It's 4 rows of code, which i miss in apache 1.3.12
and which tests existence of processed file.
