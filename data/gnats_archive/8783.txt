>Description:
I'm trying to ascertain if Apache is capable of restarting pipe processes for ErrorLog.   I've been doing piped logs with logparser for CLF format with

CustomLog "|/usr/local/bin/logparser" adti

and it works perfectly, even when the process is killed.  (what ya'll call reliable piped logs)

I have a similar program for errorlog and it doesn't restart after I kill it:
ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/errorparser"

[root@www6 /tmp]# ps ax | grep errorparser
 9898 ?        S      0:00 perl /usr/local/bin/errorparser
14367 pts/2    S      0:00 grep errorparser
[root@www6 /tmp]# kill 9898
[root@www6 /tmp]# ps ax | grep errorparser
14387 pts/2    S      0:00 grep errorparser
[root@www6 /tmp]# ps ax | grep errorparser
14392 pts/2    S      0:00 grep errorparser
[root@www6 /tmp]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart: httpd restarted
[root@www6 /tmp]# ps ax | grep errorparser
14424 ?        S      0:00 perl /usr/local/bin/errorparser
14485 pts/2    S      0:00 grep errorparser
[root@www6 /tmp]#


>How-To-Repeat:
I was able to re-create on Linux monitor 2.4.2-2 #1 Tue Oct 2 22:59:40 EDT 2001 i686 unknown with gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81) and specifying:

ErrorLog "|cat >>/tmp/error_log"

Looked in the process table for cat, saw:

 6849 ?        S      0:00 /bin/sh -c cat >>/tmp/error_log

killed 6849 and never saw it come back.
