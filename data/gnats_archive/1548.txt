>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 sp3
>Description:
If you use server-side includes at attempt of read the size of a file or #include it you have difficulty.

>How-To-Repeat:
Original code has:
   The document size is  <!--#fsize file="/phone/test.html"-->&nbsp;bytes long.

and returns:
  The document size is [an error occurred while processing this directive] bytes long

I have also seen that the #include directive does not work.

Originating code has:
   <!--#include file="/phone/test.html"-->

and returns:
   [an error occurred while processing this directive]

State-Changed-When: Fri Dec 12 10:25:45 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Please go over the mod_include documentation.  "file"
is supposed to behave that way; it does not take absolute
paths.

"virtual" is the correct way of doing such things.
