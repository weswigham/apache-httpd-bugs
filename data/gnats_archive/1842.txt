>Environment:
Win 95, version 4.00.95a.
>Description:
I skimmed the docs but didn't find any problem reports about Win 95
shortcuts.  When attempting to access a shortcut to a directory, all
I get back is a binary dump of the shortcut file (*.LNK).
>How-To-Repeat:
Install 1.3b5, configure the document root to be c:/www (after you've
created the dir, of course).  Run the server.

I have my document root directory set up as:

     c:\www

Now, I want to link to another directory (e.g. "c:\movies\avi") so I
create a shortcut and throw that into "c:\www".  Now the contents of
"c:\www" appear as:

   Volume in drive C is RYO-OHKI
   Volume Serial Number is 2C13-14DD
   Directory of C:\WWW

   .              <DIR>        02-19-98  6:25p .
   ..             <DIR>        02-19-98  6:25p ..
   AVI      LNK           368  02-19-98  6:26p avi.lnk

Now use your browser and go to the server.  You should get a listing
of files, the AVI.LNK being one of them.  Click on that and you _should_
go to the directory in question.  But, no, all you get back is "L".

As a test, type this:  "type avi.lnk".  You'll get back garbage, but the
"L" should be the first character.  I imagine that an EOF (ASCII 26) is
one of the characters following that 'L'.
>Fix:
Nope.  Check the Win32 docs on how to resolve pathnames?

State-Changed-Why:
Those are not symbolic links so any documentation on
symbolic links does not apply.  They are an ugly hack
attempting to provide similar functionality without providing
proper support by the filesystem for such a feature.

It is possible that explicit support will be added for
Win32 shortcuts at some point.  That will be tracked
in the existing PR#1753.
