Linux 2.2.12-20
>Description:
Using CGI.pm to generate html output, the standard header string 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

causes Apache to generate a "malformed header from script" error, aborting the script.

>How-To-Repeat:
Use CGI.pm to create a cgi script with the lines
print html_start();
print "test";
print html_end();
>Fix:
According to the author of CGI.pm, Apache should accept the header. (Apparently it did in all versions before 1.3.)

State-Changed-Why:

The error refers to a malformed HTTP header, not a 
malformed HTML/XML header.  Please check the 
CGI specification and the documentation for your
CGI library for information about required HTTP
headers in your script output.

Thanks for using Apache!
