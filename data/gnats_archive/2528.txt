  ((r->proto_num >= HTTP_VERSION(1,1)) && (r->chunked = 1))) &&

I think this should be 

  ((r->proto_num >= HTTP_VERSION(1,1)) && (r->chunked == 1))) &&

State-Changed-Why:
Please do as we ask and search the bugdb before submitting
a PR.  This "bug" has been reported numerous times.

Also read the source; a line or two above the code 
in question it says that the = is on purpose!

This is a bug in SGI's compiler in that it whines too much
and it can't be shut up by an extra set of ()s like gcc
can.

If I had any IRIX boxes with SGI's compiler on I would
submit a bug report about the broken compiler, but I don't.

Thanks.
