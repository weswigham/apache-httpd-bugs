>Description:
again and again i find a core-file in my home-dir made by apache. 
we tried every release since 1.2b6, the problems remain always the same.
i can't figure out any reasons for that. 

any hints?

I'm assuming this is fixed in 1.2 release.  If it isn't please
re-open another problem report.  Thanks.
