>Description:
This is a followup on the last bug report that I sent.
This problem does not happen when using microsoft internet explorer v 3.01.
This problem occurs when using netscape in some patterns.  I am enumerating
some of the cases.
 1. open up www.brazil-brasil.com/open.htm works.
 2. open up www.brazil-brasil.com follows by a click on the blinking eye fails.
 3. open up www.flic.net/~dinh follows by a click on the blinking eye works.
 4. open up www.flic.net/~dinh/open.htm works.

I think this is a netscape problem.
