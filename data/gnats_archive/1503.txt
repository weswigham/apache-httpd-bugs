>Description:
As advised in #1501, we rebuilt from source, first verifying that
util_script.c does indeed include the change from PR #1030, which it
does (we changed no source). We installed the rebuilt exe and dll, 
started things back up, and saw no different behaviour from the 
prebuilt 1.3b3 binary: the #1030 problem still affects us.
>How-To-Repeat:
As per #1501/#1030.
