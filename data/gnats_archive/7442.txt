>Description:
when configuring the apache with command "./configure --prefix=/var/www --enable-suexec --suexec-caller=www --suexec-userdir=/usr/home --suexec-uidmin=100 --suexec-gidmin=100",and installed completely and configured the VirtualHost to using the user's own ID AND GID with "user id gloup id" to run his own cgi in "httpd.conf",the apache started but when running a cgi it say that "500 Internal Server Error" and the log is "error: command not in docroot".
  i think it's a problem.

State-Changed-Why:
suexec-userdir should be the single directory that
would ordinarily be passed to a UserDir directive
in httpd.conf.  I don't believe that it will work with
anything expect the single directory format, eg.
"public_html" or "www".

Thanks for using Apache!
