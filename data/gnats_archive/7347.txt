>Description:
I´m trying to install apache_1.3.19-win32-no_src.msi. I have already installed MSI Installer version 1.20.1827.0. When I double click the apache_1.3.19-win32-no_src.msi the Apache httpd Server Installation Wizard opens and searches for installed applications. The Property is EXISTING_APACHE_SERVICE_PATH, Signature:E. Then I get this Error message: Internal Error 2735. ResolveServerName and when I press OK I quit the installer. I looked for solution at the bug database and I found report about the 2735 error. I didn´t understand the report.

Thank you for your time.
