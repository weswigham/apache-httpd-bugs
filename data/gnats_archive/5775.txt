After fully compiling the default configuration of Apache 1.3.11 and executing

it reports that it is version 1.3.9

What gives?  I redownloaded, unpacked and compiled as default to see if it was my configuration giveing the problem, but httpd -v still reports 1.3.9

Download the Apache 1.3.11, unpack, and compile as default.  Now execute ./src/httpd -v.
>Fix:
Correct the version number and or make sure the Apache 1.3.11 is what it says it is.
