Linux scott 2.0.29 #1 Fri May 16 13:34:34 MEST 1997 i586,
as your cgi - script insists on it.  It doesn't matter.
>Description:
It would be very helpful it the documentation would contain a link (URL)
to the CGI/1.1 specification, or possibly the text of that specification
itself.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to find out details about CGI/1.1, given the htdoc - documentation
as a starting point.
>Fix:
I suggest adding a link (URL) to both the faq and also to
htdocs/manual/mod/mod_cgi.html .  Not much work for you,
very helpfull for folks like myself

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for pointing this out; I'll see that it is
added.  The latest version can be found at
<http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~drtr/cgi-spec.html>; it's
somewhat newer (though less well known) than the
one at NCSA.

Thanks for using Apache!

 I suggest we do a "relevant standards and documents" page, which
 references all the current and past standards that we conform to.  In
 particular it should include references to rfc1945, and 2068.  Plus refs
 to the mime rfcs.  Maybe refs to things like the robots.txt standard,
 which is just handy to have.

 You mean like http://www.apache.org/library/ but expanded?

 Thank you!
