>Environment:
Windows 98
>Description:
installing jserv modified by adding the statement twice:

include "c:\program files\apache group\apache jserv\conf\mod_jserv.conf"

consequently, the variables were being assigned twice and apache would crash.
One possible explanation to this is that I had two setups going on at once (the installer hid itself in the background and I thought it had crashed).    
>How-To-Repeat:
install jserv with multiple instances of the install I suppose, if that was the cause
>Fix:
don't allow multiple set ups or check for the existence of the include statement

State-Changed-Why:
thanks, we know about this and hope to fix it in the next release by first checking to see if that file exists, if it does, assume that the include line is already in the httpd.conf file.
