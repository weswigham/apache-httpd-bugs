>Description:
My server is set up as follows : 2 "plain" apache processes listen for incoming connections (one for http, one for https).  When dynamic content is called for,  the request is proxied to an apache process (on port 808 and 809 (for SSL)) that includes mod_perl.

Dynamic content is decided by a bunch of RewriteRules that have [Proxy] flags.  All this works perfectly, but for one point: REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_PORT on the mod_perl process has information regarding the "front-end" apache processes, not the remote user's browser.  This means there is no way to use IP for session ID validation and expiration, etc.

The following patch propagates host, port, user and ident information proxied header.  Headers are prefixed with Proxy-  and are then available on the far end as HTTP_PROXY_
