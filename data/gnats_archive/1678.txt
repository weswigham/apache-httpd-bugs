>Environment:
OS - NT 4.0, SP3
Visual C++ 5.0
>Description:
I have made the configuration as described in the documentation, but if I start Apache as a service in NT, my system 'hangs' for a while during start-up and after many seconds I have a message saying that at least one service failed to start (Apache). If I start it from the comand line, it works ok. Could it be a configuration problem? Or is it a bug?
If after NT starts, I start the service in the control panel, it also works ok!
>How-To-Repeat:
Apache -i
Control Panel - services - Start Apache service
>Fix:
No, sorr

State-Changed-Why:

This is a known problem and most likely caused by
configuration errors.

Try starting Apache from a DOS box to find out if
there are any errors in your configuration.
