UNIX Linux / gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Using the fragment:

LDFLAGS="-s"
export LDFLAGS
./configure ...blahblah...

Results in the resulting configuration files to put the -s in both EXTRA_LDFLAGS
and LDFLAGS resulting in them appearing twice.  This is evident when the makefiles
run.

Critical if the flag cannot appear twice...
>How-To-Repeat:
Oh yes...
>Fix:
fix the configuration coding to not do this.  Sorry just a report....:-%2

State-Changed-Why:
Although there is no need to export the variables (the
"KEY=VALUE command" is _ONE_ line) I've fixed this
situation for 1.3b7. Because the chance is high that
other users export the variables, too. Now the
"configure" script clears them after using to
avoid side-effects in the old src/Configuration script.
Thanks for this report.
