Starts happening after the server is started and about 10-20 cgi scripts

Checked the ulimit, it's set to unlimited.

The only way I can keep it under control is to have in the crontab to
restart the server every five minutes. But it still happens in between.

but most likely it will work, because I have the server restarting every 5 min.
I've got to make it work somehow until I can get the problem fixed.

I have no idea. I just upgraded the server from some old version of NCSA,
(which did the same thing by the way), and installed Apache just this past
weekend. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 This really looks like some problem with your OS, since it happens with
 NCSA too.  Can you verify if this is related to the number of scripts
 being executed at one time, or if it will happen after 10-20 scripts are
 run even if there is only one running at any time?

 The only thing I can verify is that after restarting the server the scripts
 work for a short time then stop working until the server restarts again.
 
 I've noticed this message on the System messages:
                 vmunix: fork/procdup: task_create failed. Code: 0x11
 
 I think, no make that I know it's connected, because I just got a failed
 script
 and the message popped up at the same time.
 
 Any ideas? Thanks.

 This really looks like your OS is having some problem.  You should be sure
 you have all the latest patches installed for you OS and contact your
 vendor to see if they can help.
 
 This is really looking like an OS problem, and there isn't much we can do
 to track it down.

 I solved the problem. My OS (OSF/1 3.2) is a very old build, so it wasn't
 well configured to run as a web server. So, you have to change your machine 
 kernel configurations, it has a limit on the number of proccesses and the
 number of children that can be spawned, the variables are maxusers (which
 has nothing to do with actual users but the number of proccesses allowed)
 and maxuprc. They were at 128 and 64 respectively, but I changed them to
 128 and 256 respectively. Once you change those configs (in 
 /sys/conf/the_name_of_your_machine) you must re-build the kernel and
 replace the new kernal with the old, of course make a backup of your
 old kernal in case all else fails.
 
 I haven't seen the error once since rebuilding the kernel, about 15 hours
 ago. The error use to occur at least once every minute.
 
 Thanks for trying to help anyway.
