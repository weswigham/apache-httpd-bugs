>Environment:
SunOS island 5.6 Generic_105181-17 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
I have the same problem as described in #1275, but the solution there
doesn't work for me, because the automount directory here is /home/
and its not possible to set AllowOverride for each user directory,
especially when adding new users ....

Any other work arounds?
>How-To-Repeat:
See #1275
>Fix:
Something like

NO_HTACCESS_WITHIN_THIS_DIRECTORY

that will allow .htacces files above the directory and in the directories subdirs ...
