>Organization:
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, gcc, SunOS nfs 5.6 Generic_105181-16 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
>Description:
The error checking of the Host: header which was added in 1.3.10 breaks requests
that refer to hostnames containing an underscore. This was first reported in 
PR#5722 regarding Virtual Hosts, but it appears that it happens in servers which
do not use virtual hosts at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
In your /etc/hosts file, add an alias for your webserver's IP, using 
telnet to a 1.3.10 or newer server on port 80 and give the following:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: blah_zing
>Fix:
It looks like the problem is in the fix_hostname function in main/http_vhost.c.
