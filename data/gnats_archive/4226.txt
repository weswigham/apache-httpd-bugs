>Description:
The ServerSocket is binding to IN_ADDR_ANY which is a potential performance issue, but more importantly exposes the servlet engine to the outside world, DoS attacks are way to simple here.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
This can easily be rectified in src/java/org/apache/java/net/AuthenticatedServerSocket.java when the call to the superclass's constructor occurs.  As in interim fix, I set mine to bind only to 127.0.0.1 or InetAddress.getByName("localhost") as the third parameter.  As a long term fix I think the jserv.properties should contain not only a port directive but an address/port pair similar to the Listen directive in Apache would be nice.  I would like to help with this effort on other fronts if any is needed please get in touch.
