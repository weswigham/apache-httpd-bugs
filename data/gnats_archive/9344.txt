 *** Here Comes The Judge ***
 http://www.backofthenet.com
     In Kalamzoo Mich., a federal judge ordered the Michigan High School Athletic Association to change the calendar for girls' sports because the current calendar is discriminatory.
 
 Citing the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, as well as Michigan civil rights laws, U.S. District Judge Richard A. Enslen ordered the athletic organization to move the seasons for girls basketbal l, volleyball, golf, soccer, swimming and tennis to more traditional dates.
 
 Only a few other states hold the girls basketball season in the fall and the volleyball season in the winter. Monday's decision brings all in line with the rest of the nation.
 
 The ruling came in a class-action suit filed by Communities for Equity, which is based in Grand Rapids, and followed a two-week, non-jury trial that ended Oct. 4.
 
 Plaintiffs' attorneys argued the MHSAA discriminated against female athletes because the calendar reduced the opportunities for interstate competition, thus reducing the opportunity for national recognition; was out-of-sync with National Letter of Intent  dates, reducing the opportunity to win scholarships; and was shorter than the boys' seasons.
 
 MHSAA Executive Director Jack Roberts said the decision would be appealed.
 
 "It's not over until its over -- and it's not over today," he told the Grand Rapids Press.
 
 The MHSAA has surveyed its membership six times since 1973 about realigning seasons and a majority of schools opposed such action, including in the most recent survey in 1998 in which 82 percent said they wanted to stick with the current schedule.
 
 The Oceanside United Soccer Club's Tournament Committee would like to thank all those who registered for this years tournament, and wish everyone a Happy New Year. Letters will be going out this week to registered teams scheduled to play our opening week end. Don't be left out in the cold, this years tournament has shaped up to be our best in 35 years. Our interactive cafeteria (even better than last years), 11,000 Square Foot Composite Playing Surface, Two referee system and a minimum of four 10-minute  preliminary games, followed by Semi's and Finals, with awards for the top 4 teams in each bracket, and trophies for all intramural teams. The RUDY one tournament you don't want to miss, don't wait and find out how Great the RUDY is from the Message Board .
  
 The Intramural deadline is approaching fast and there is still a few openings for U-11 Girls Teams and U-12 Major Teams in our travel division, Any teams interested should contact Al Haft at 516-967-7629. Happy New Year to all and we look forward to seei ng everyone at our 35th Annual Rudy Lamonica Indoor Soccer Tournament. 
  
 Take your part in History, Do The RUDY in 2002.
