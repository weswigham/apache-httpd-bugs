State-Changed-Why:
Ensure that you have either htm listed as an extension for
text/html in your mime.types file or an AddType directive
doing the same thing.  Apache 1.2 is distributed that way;
if you are using the RedHat RPM, there have been many reports
of it being broken in this exact way; that is something you
would have to take up with them, since the 1.2.x that we
distribute has no such problem.
