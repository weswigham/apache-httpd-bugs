>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.2.8
>Description:
When MultiViews is enabled, it allows matches of directory requests to files, which breaks all relative server-side includes as well client-side images/urls.
>How-To-Repeat:
With an /index.html.en, /index.html.ru, /index.html.jp, etc present and MultiViews enabled, it is possible for a client to request http://mysite.com/index/ and the appropriate document for your language preferences will be returned.  However, all relative "IMG" and "A" links within the html will be resolved on the client side to be under the invalid "index" directory.

Additionally, if index.html.en is a file containing SSI directives, such as to include another file by a relative virtual location, Apache will interpret the include directive as being "relative" to the non-existent directory, and when it attempts to read the include target, it invokes the file again, causing a SSI recursion loop.
>Fix:
When parsing each path part of a requested URL, it should not attempt to treat files matched by MultiViews as directories.  Just as a site with MultiViews disabled returns 404 for http://mysite.com/index.html/blah/whatever/etc, a site with MultiViews enabled should also return 404.

State-Changed-When: Wed Nov 24 17:44:07 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Any server with SSIs enabled is supposed to allow extra
path info to be appended at the end.  This is a feature and
is designed to allow the use of SSIs as dynamnic content based
on the query string.
