>Description:
I downloaded & installed the Apache Web Server v1.3.3 for Windows and it's great!  As a Linux fan, I think it's great to be able to use the same services on a windows machine.  I do however think that it would be nicer if when you ran the server, instead of displaying a normal program window on your task bar, to actually show a small icon by the time at the bottom right.  Other than that, everything works great.
