>Description:

There's a *.shtml-page that includes the <!--#exec...--> ...ution of
some shell script.  It takes the script a while to do any 
sophisticated things.  The user (client) is impatient an cancels 
the request (e.g. moves towards another webpage):

To me it seems that the execution of the shell script on the server
is completed - and not terminated - although its output will be 
rejected anyway.

>How-To-Repeat:
Easily.  8->
>Fix:

Is it possible to catch any signal about the cancellation of the 
request by the client, and kill the job running on the server?

Is it possible to define for SSI (and for CGI-scripts too) an
upper limit of CPU-time the may consume ... and to kill them
automaticly, if they exceed that limit?

 Erm... there is no such signal to catch, unless it outputs "enough" data,
 and then Apache will kill it.

 Check the docs for the RLimit* directives.
