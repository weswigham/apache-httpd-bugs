>Description:
I'm trying to switch to Apache from a Netscape Enterprise+Netgravity setup. 

I need to provide backward compatibility with the Adserver: I set up then
a Rewrite rule (but tried also with ProxyPass) so that everything
beginning with /html.ng and /event.ng is redirected to the Netscape server
listening on another port. 
The problem is with URL like this one:

http://this.host/event.ng/Type=click&ProfileID=13&RunID=302&AdID=73&GroupID=3&FamilyID=3&TagValues=152.239.244.245&Redirect=http:%2F%2Fsome.host

For some strange reason Apache refuses to apply rewriting rules to this URL,
due to the "%2F" contained there (at the end): my RewriteLog (level 9) is empty and as 
far as I can see there is no invocation of the Rewrite engine (nor of the Proxy 
engine for that matter). All I get is a 404 from the Apache server itself. In my
logs I have this:

192.168.122.14 - - [31/Mar/1999:14:37:03 -0100] "GET /event.ng/Type=click&ProfileID=13&RunID=919&AdID=311&GroupID=3&FamilyID=1&TagValues=152.239.244.245&Redirect=http:%2F%2Fwww.some.host%2F HTTP/1.0" 404 434

while the error page shown by Apache substitutes the "%2F: with slashes:
The requested URL

/event.ng/Type=click&ProfileID=13&RunID=302&AdID=73&GroupID=3&FamilyID=3&TagValues=152.239.244.245&Redirect=http://www.some.host/
was not found on this server.

If I replace the %2F in the URL with "/" (or with any other "%" encoded 
characters) everything works just fine. 

I suspect this is a bug: I browsed the FAQs & documentation but couldn't 
find a clue.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately our test servers are firewalled, so I can't give you an URL to
try out.
