>Description:
I'm trying to redirect all requests for a set of pages to a secure URL.
However during the processing mod_rewrite prepends path-info to the string
which ends up in the final URL.  eg http://www/this/that.html turns into
https://www/etc/httpd/htdocs/this/that.html

The documentation for mod_rewrite states that

    "When you prefix a substitution field with http://thishost[:thisport]
     then mod_rewrite automatically strips it out."

However this isn't happenning for me.

Looking at problem number 3855, it may be related to the fact that I'm rewriting
within a <Location> directive.

>How-To-Repeat:
Include httpd.conf section thusly:

<Location /proj/>
  AuthName "Intranet"
  AuthType Basic
  AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/auth/apache.auth
  Require valid-user

  # redirect to secure if not secure
  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  <IfDefine SSL>
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPS} ^$
     RewriteRule ^/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [L,R]
  </IfDefine>
  </IfModule>
</Location>


My rewrite log shows:

Similar corruption ocurrs if I redirect to "http" rather than "https".
>Fix:
My workaround is to use this rewrite rule:

    RewriteRule ^/(.*)  https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}      [L,R]
