 Back of "THE NET" :: GU-19 Long Island All Stars v Washington Freedom Set
 ...........................................................
  
 Washington Freedom with Mia Hamm Accept our Challenge
 
 2002 Long Island All Girls All Star Team Seeking Players 
 
 Long Island, New York - January 29, 2002 - 
 Once again we are putting together a team of some of 
 Long Island's best female players to play some of the 
 world's best players including the FIFA female player of 
 the year, MIA HAMM. 
 
 This year Jim Gabarra, coach of the Washington 
 Freedom accepted the challenge on JKI to have the 
 Washington Freedom including Mia play our All Star 
 Team in Washington on SATURDAY, MARCH 16TH. 
 Additionally, the Boston Breakers and Philadelphia 
 Charge have responded positively to our invitation, and 
 we expect that now that the WUSA 2002 schedule is in 
 place that we will have a green light to play both those 
 teams.  As a courtesy to our host teams we will roster 
 18 of the 25 players from Long Island/ENY and look to 
 have 7 guest players from the host city join our team.
 
 Any girl who is currently playing U-16 or older or is in 
 college and will play U-19 this Spring is encouraged to 
 respond.  Please email larry@backofthenet.com with 
 your NAME, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE #, DOB, CURRENT 
 TEAM, and BRIEF BIO.  There will be no tryouts. This is 
 an ad hoc team with no affiliation and no agenda other 
 than the pure fun of playing and the chance for some 
 of our girls to play against the best and to be coached 
 by the best.  I don't know who will coach the team yet, 
 we hope Tony DiCicco will come back if his schedule 
 allows.
 
 We also would like to know when you send us a note if 
 you have been accepted to a college or where you are 
 applying.  If you are a junior or a sophmore playing up 
 (U-16 or higher) you are invited to reply.  We may 
 make up a different or partially different team if we get 
 to play teams other than the Freedom so more girls can 
 have the experience that was enjoyed by our team last 
 year.  Again, this is simply for fun and a good time and 
 for an experience you might not otherwise get.  We 
 hope to hear from you.
 
 2002 WUSA Schedule Announced
 
 The Women's United Soccer Association 
 second season will kick off April 13 as dates and 
 matchups for the league's 
 2002 campaign were announced today by WUSA 
 Commissioner Tony DiCicco.  The 
 WUSA's schedule will feature 83 percent of the league's 
 matches on weekends 
 or holidays, including 63 percent of WUSA games on 
 Saturdays.
 
 All eight teams will kick off their season on April 13 as 
 the Atlanta Beat 
 hosts the Philadelphia Charge, the New York Power 
 travels to RFK Stadium to 
 take on the Washington Freedom, and the San Diego 
 Spirit hosts the Carolina 
 Courage.  The highlight of the weekend takes place at 
 4 p.m. ET when the 
 defending WUSA Champion San Jose CyberRays battle 
 the Boston Breakers at 
 Spartan Stadium in a nationally televised match on PAX 
 TV.  The entire WUSA 
 on PAX national television schedule will be announced in 
 the near future.
 
 
 All games during the first nine weeks of the 2002 
 season will be played on 
 Saturdays or Sundays.  The first weekday match will be 
 Wednesday June 12 when 
 Washington hosts Boston.    The WUSA will play 70 of 
 84 games on Saturday, 
 Sunday or a holiday, meaning 83 percent of all matches 
 will be on a weekend 
 or a holiday.  During the league's inaugural season in 
 2001, only 71 percent 
 of all matches were played on a weekend or holiday.  
 Saturday was the most 
 popular day among fans in 2001, drawing 39 percent 
 more fans than the 
 league's season average of 8,104.
 
 Each team will play a 21-game schedule, with New 
 York, Philadelphia, San Jose 
 and Washington playing 11 home matches and 10 road 
 games.  Atlanta, Boston, 
 Carolina and San Diego will play 10 home games and 11 
 road contests.  Each 
 club that has 11 home games in 2002 had only 10 home 
 matches in 2001.
