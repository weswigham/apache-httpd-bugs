>Description:
Although when I put order deny,allow -> deny access to all, it denys all access
to the documents (showing that it is reading the file) but when I put
 
<Directory /home/httpd/pts>
<\Directory>

and then type http://localhost/pts/<file> it says it can't find the file? 
Even though the file is there?

Thanks.
Please reply (forsyth@wchat.on.ca)

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... you have to be more specific about just what you are
trying to do.

Exactly what are you putting where when it denies access?

Exactly what do you think that the "<Directory /home/httpd/pts>"
section should do?

 No, please go through the docs or ask on Usenet.
 
 Directory sections don't do anything except apply directives to particular
 directories on disk.  If you want to make them available, they have to be
 setup that way explicitly; eg. DocumentRoot, Alias, etc.
