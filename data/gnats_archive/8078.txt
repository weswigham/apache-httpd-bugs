>Description:
Imagine a grid, with one axis reading local controls and reading 
global controls, and the second axis reading multiviews and type-map.

Now the permutations would read something like this: 

multiviews allow local control of language negotiation (at the directory level)
multiviews allow global control of language negotiation (at the whole directory tree level)
type-maps allow local control of language negotiation (one type map per directory applies to each file one at a time)
type-maps allow global control of language negotiation.

Except that the last one does not exist; is not possible.  

For an existing web tree with hundreds of thousands of files, it is not
acceptable to create a type map entry for every single file in the tree.

It would be nice if some wildcard support was added to type-maps, something like this:

URI: *.fr
Content-Language: fr

URI: *.en
Content-Language: en

URI: *.js.en
Content-Language: en, *


There are two things being demonstrated here:

1- wildcard by filename/urlname.  This way I only need to create one template 
type-map per directory, and don't have to worry that it needs updating every 
time a new file is created/translated/makde multi-lingual.

2- there's a * in the Content-Language which hopefully could be used to prevent
the 406 error page.  This is highly desirable for embedded/included content like 
javascript.  The main place that the "406 Not Acceptable... no variants 
found..." error page falls over is with included content.  In netscape, if I
load index.html (main page for all languages) which contains
<script language="JavaScript" SRC="/foo/menuRollover.js">
then I get an error page saying that I should choose one of 
menuRollover.js.en, fr, etc, which definitely is NOT acceptable.  

The effect is to short-circuit the 406 error and redirect the user to an
expected default language.  For internal/intranet sites, the expected or
"common" language is well known, and is perfectly reasonable to set a default.

Alternatively to this latter is to globally for the server set a 406 override,
though it's less flexible and is much more brute force.  I'm doing this
today because it's easier:

(see the suggested way to fix it uuencode'd unified diff)

I think that expanding the type-map capabilities rounds out apache and makes 
it more flexible.
