>Organization:
>Environment:
OS/2 4.5 (WSeB), running binaries from Apache website
>Description:
For example, the URL
http://prospero.aleph1010/cgi-bin/printenv/emx/include/stdlib.h
produces SCRIPT_NAME="/cgi-bin/printenv". Changing it to:
http://prospero.aleph1010/cgi-bin/printenv/eMx/include/stdlib.h produces
SCRIPT_NAME="/cgi-bin/printenv/eMx", 
http://prospero.aleph1010/cgi-bin/printenv/emx/incluDe/stdlib.h produces
SCRIPT_NAME="/cgi-bin/printenv/emx/incluDe" and
http://prospero.aleph1010/cgi-bin/printenv/emx/include/stdLib.h produces
SCRIPT_NAME="/cgi-bin/printenv/emx/include/stdLib.h"

As you can see, the value of SCRIPT_NAME stretches to the last path component
containing an uppercase letter.

This may be related, but I've also noticed that PATH_INFO consistently gets
squished to lowercase. Although the OS/2 filesystem is case-insensitive,
this creates problems with programs that expect an exact match.




>How-To-Repeat:
It may well be an OS/2-specific problem. The above examples are derived from
the cgi-bin/printenv included with the distribution.
>Fix:
No, but I'll be looking at the code to try to track it down.
