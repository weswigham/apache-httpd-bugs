Linux phil 2.0.33 #4 Wed May 20 12:50:38 CDT 1998 i586
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
Whenever httpd is started (with suexec support compiled in), the following message is printed on stderr:

Configuring Apache for use with suexec wrapper.

This (doesn't appear) to present a problem when the server is ran in standalone mode, but with inetd, the message is sent to browsers. Internet Explorer 4.0 (under Windows) handles this fine, but Internet Explorer 3.0 (under Windows) and Netscape Communicator 4.05 (under Windows) displays the message, and then the HTML source as text.

Even adding httpd 2> /dev/null in the inetd entry does not fix the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile httpd with suexec, and run httpd to view the message.
Stick httpd in inetd, and view the server's page using IE3 or Netscape Comm. 4.05
>Fix:
I commented out the line that printed this message, which was in src/main/http_main.c line 2745. However I would suggest adding a -q (for quiet) option, or something along those lines.
