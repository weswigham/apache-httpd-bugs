Solaris 2.5.1, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
When the Apache httpd starts, it spawns off a (configurable) number of child
processes.  When "kill -9" is issued to the original process, the children do
not die, and the port remains tied up.
>How-To-Repeat:
Description above should suffice
>Fix:
Hack the source to kill children as part of its own terminatio

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Thu Mar 27 09:45:07 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
When you kill -9 you do not give the server any opportunity to perform
and cleanup.  -9 is unmaskable.  You just want to send a plain kill to the
server and let it do its cleanup, which does include killing the children.
