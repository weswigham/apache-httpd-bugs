>Description:
If symlink is a first component of path then it will not be followed
even if the FollowSymlinks or SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is set to directory and
owner of symlink is the same as the owner of the directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
user's real homedir path is /home/homem/user/login for compatibility reasons
system has a symlink /homel -> /home/homel and /etc/passwd says the user's homedir
is /homel/users/login. As the symlink is the first component of the path then apache
fails to follow it even is FollowSymlinks and/or SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is set
to both directories /homem and /home/homem in httpd.conf

State-Changed-When: Mon Jul 23 10:31:27 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
If you want /symlink to be followed as a symlink, then you have  allow symlinks to be followed for the directory "/".  Just like if you want "/foo/bar/baz/symlink" to be followed, you have to allow symlinks to be followed for the directory "/foo/bar/baz"
