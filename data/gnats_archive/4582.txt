Hello,

I can't set cookies with SSI, maybe the server only recognizes Content-type header and no the Set-Cookie headers when parsing the outcome of a SSI included CGI (with include/virtual method). I would like to suggest you that you append a cookie to the top of the main page buffer, so that it can be set as the page is loaded by browser.

I hope that makes sense.

Thank you.
>How-To-Repeat:
By not correcting it.
>Fix:
Put all Set-Cookie (and other...) headers in the top of main page's buffer.

State-Changed-Why:
Of course you can't set a cookie from the output of a
SSI.  The headers output from the SSI have nothing to do
with the headers returned to the client, nor should they.
It isn't reasonable to buffer the entire page just incase
someone wants to set a cookie in some SSI.
