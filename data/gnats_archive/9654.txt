>Release:        Apache/2.0.28
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Server, with latest patches.  This is using the downloaded binary, 2.0.38.
>Description:
I have uninstalled Apache 2.0.38 from starting as a service, as I need to be able to start it from the commandline.  When I start Apache 2.0.28 from the commandline (by typing "apache"), everything starts fine, no error messages are displayed and the server works.  To stop the apache server from the commandline, the documentation says to try "apache -k shutdown". When I do this from another commandline, this fails to work, I recieve an error message stating: [<date/time>] [error] (22502)The system cannot find the file specified. : No installed service named "Apache".   This worked in previous 1.3 versions of Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
In one command windows type apache. After it starts, confirm that the server is working.  In another command windows type "apache -k shutdown".

State-Changed-Why:

Ctrl-C will shut down the server in the current window.

There were also a number of bugs identified in the Win32 MPM
that may have contributed to your frustration, these should
be fixed.  Note that as-a-service is now the supported
standard, unlike early 1.3 releases when it was once highly
experimental.
