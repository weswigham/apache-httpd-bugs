>Description:
If you have url /file%20name.html or /dir%20name/file.html and spell it slightly
wrong (as per how mod_speling works) then it doesn't re-escape the " " (space)
back to "%20".

(PS. if you want the patch below e-mailed as an attachment, let me know. 
Also - I have nuke-trailing-whitespace on, so there are a few extra "bogus"
lines in this diff.)

 Hi,
 
 It looks like you've read my bug report and tried to fix the problem
 in the correct manner (rather than my kludgy way) in 1.3.11.
 
 However, you've only fixed it for the single choice case (line 411
 mod_speling.c).
 
 In the multiple choice case (line 471) you're still using ap_strcat
 and not escaping the URL.
 
 Here's an untested patch (for 1.3.11) based on your code for the
 single choice case:
 
 Cheers,
 nic
