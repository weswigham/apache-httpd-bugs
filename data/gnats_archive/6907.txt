>Description:
./Makefile sets EXTRA_CFLAGS on the command line when it runs "make" to build
the "suexec" binary file.  The command line has precidence over the EXTRA_CFLAGS
value defined in the ./src/support/Makefile.  Therefore any values of CFLAGS
set when ./configure is run will be ignored when building "suexec".
>How-To-Repeat:
export CFLAGS="+DAportable"
./configure --enable-suexec --suexec-caller=www

If you run the above, you will see that "+DAportable" is passed to all "cc"
commands EXCEPT the one that builds "suexec".
>Fix:
In ./Makefile.tmpl instead of passing "EXTRA_CFLAGS" on the command line use
"EXTRA_SU_CFLAGS" (line 197), and in ./src/support/Makefile.tmpl add
"$(EXTRA_SU_CFLAGS)" to the end of the "CFLAGS=" definition (line 2).
