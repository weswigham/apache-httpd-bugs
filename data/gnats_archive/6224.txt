I'm at a loss as to why apache wants to use port 204, it is 80 in the config file. In any case, when it runs, the client (netscape mac) tells me the network connection was refused and so on. Unfortunately I'm terribly new at this, and self-teaching. There were 2 older versions of Apache, and they got mixed up, so I had to build a new one. I feel like a process I don't recognize is the problem, maybe.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure you are using the config file that you think you
are using?  The best way to check this, is to add some garbage
to the top of the config file and try to restart the server.

If it starts, you have another config file somewhere.  If it doesn't,
then we at least know which config file you are using.

Also, what modules do you have compiled in to the server?  What
modules are you trying to load dynamically?  Have you tried a
minimal configuration for Apache?

Thank you for the bug report.
