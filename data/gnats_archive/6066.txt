Hello
We're working with FreeTds for SQLServer 7.0 in OS Win2000 AS and Apache 1.3.12 and Jserv 1.1. In certain conditions we receive an internal server error and in log error file we catch the error: "Ajpv12 Cannot scan servlet header". The problem is that we cannot reproduce the error condition because we have users on line.
This error didn't occur when we were working with Sybase and Sybase-Jdbc.
