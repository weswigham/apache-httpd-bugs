>Description:
caught SIGBUS, dumping core. The error occurs when
dir listing is turned on and the mod_dir.c module
has 0 num_ent. The palloc() call in index_directory()
doesn't seem to handle size zero properly. I fixed
the problem by checking that num_ent > 0 in order
to do any of the code from the palloc() call through
the qsort(). output_directories() handles num_ent
of zero just fine and problem is avoided.
