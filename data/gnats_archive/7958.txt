SunOS *** 5.8 Generic_108528-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60

This should not be OS dependant, should occur everwhere.
>Description:
module/proxy can deliver a blank page under the following
circumstance: The version in our disk cache has expired, but
an If-Modified-Since request returns HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED.  The
proxy server then sends the client a response that has the
headers received from the server we are proxing, but the body
from the disk cache.  Since these headers have a Content-Length
of 0, a blank page is displayed in most web browsers.

The problem is caused by the response headers being put into
the cache record too early.  This causes ap_proxy_cache_update()
to return the response headers instead of the headers read from
the cache file. (see proxy_cache.c, Line 1041)
>How-To-Repeat:
We were getting this pretty consistently when proxying for a web page
served up by IIS-5.  It may just be that that server is more likely
to return HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED.

You'll want to set your cache lifetime to a small value as this only
happens when cache_check() returns DECLINED but has an expired entry
in its cache.  It may depended on the calling browser sending an 
If-modified-since header.
>Fix:
Take the following line of code in proxy_http.c, line 454:

    c->hdrs = resp_hdrs;

And move it after the call to ap_proxy_cache_update().

This seems to fix the problem.
