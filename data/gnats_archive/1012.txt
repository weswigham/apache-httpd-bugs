Sparc, Solaris 2.5.1, SUN's compilers.
>Description:
If you are using a SOLARIS2 OS, then the code in make_sock (file http_main.c)
calls  sock_bind (s, server);, then proceeds with some setsockopt calls.
The SO_REUSEADDR setsockopt doesn't have any effect on an already bind'd
socket. The problem was not present in 1.2.1.

>How-To-Repeat:

You can easily replicate the problem by starting the server, then quickly killing
it, then attempting to restart it. You get an error about not being able to
bind to port 80. Of course, you do this on a Solaris system...
>Fix:
Go back to what was in the 1.2.1 release and do the setsockopt's before calling
bind. This is what I've done, and I've not noticed any problems (thus far :-%2

State-Changed-Why:
This has hopefully been resolved in the current source
tree; 1.2.3 will contain a better fix when released.

The reason why we had to work around things is because
Solaris has some _very_ brain-dead socket code that is
simply horribly horribly broken.  The way things are
done in 1.2.1 causes problems with HUPs.  If it works for
you, then it works for you.
