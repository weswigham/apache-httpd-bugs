>Description:
Each VH gets a /lcgi-bin local cgi directory.

They get the following configuration :

ScriptAlias /lcgi-bin/ /local/wwwcust/karupspc/lcgi-bin/
<Location /lcgi-bin>
Action cgi-wrapper /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/karupspc
SetHandler cgi-wrapper
</Location>

I now want FastCGI support, so I changed it to :

ScriptAlias /lcgi-bin/ /local/wwwcust/karupspc/lcgi-bin/
<Location /lcgi-bin>
AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcg .fcgi .fpl
Action cgi-wrapper /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/karupspc
SetHandler cgi-wrapper
</Location>

However, no matter what, it seems not to run the fastcg-script handler.

Can you not have a handler within a handler? Is there no way to
say "If it ends in .fcg, .fcgi, .fpl use the fastcgi-script handler,
else "Action cgi-wrapper /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/karupspc ; SetHandler cgi-wrapper"

The optimal, of course is to do the cgi-wrapper, then within that do
the fastcgi-script.
