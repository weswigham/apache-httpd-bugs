Currently the 'AuthType Basic' allows a users name/pwd to be remembered in the
browser for that session.  So, if a user doesn't log out, another person can
use the browsers forward/back buttons to view the private information that the
name/pwd attained.

Add a way in the htaccess file to allow for the choice of if one wants the setup
to include a 'cache' of an authentication name/pwd

 I have no idea what you mean by "cache type items" allowed in the system
 files.

 There is nothing that can be done that is suitable for building into
 Apache.  If you ask in various newsgroups I'm sure you can get suggestions
 on alternatives.

That is for the proxy.  This has nothing to do with the proxy.

No.

 Except that if you look you will notice that it doesn't exist yet.
 
 You can expire basic auth credentials on the server, but that means that
 they are never ever valid for the client again.  So if you want to give
 someone access to a site for two days, that works.  If you want to give
 them access forever, but timeout if they don't access the site for x
 minutes, it doesn't.

 That has nothing to do with expiring them by making them invalid, that is
 strictly expiring them from the cache.

 I said that because it is the case.  There are hacks you can do to work
 around it somewhat, but they have no place in Apache and don't work well.
