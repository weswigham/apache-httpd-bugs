>Description:
A DocumentRoot containing a ~user mnemonic doesnt work, I get:

Warning: DocumentRoot [~test/company] does not exist
>How-To-Repeat:
adduser (test)
mkdir /home/test/company
throw a simple index.html into /home/test/company

Apache Configuration:

<VirtualHost www.comapany.com>
ServerName www.company.com
DocumentRoot ~test/company
</VirtualHost>

apache configtest
>Fix:
nope

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: jim
State-Changed-When: Thu Mar 11 18:38:56 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
The ~user mnemonic doesnt work because it's not supported. DocumentRoot must be a true (possibly globbed) pathname. ~user is mainly a shell construct.
