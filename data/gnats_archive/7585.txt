>Description:
I do not have libtool installed.  configure and make run fine.  make install
fails to find libtool for srclib/apr and srclib/apr-util, since Makefile.in
uses libtool instead of ./libtool, to reference the libtool in the current
directory.  I edited these Makefiles to use ./libtool, and now make install
works perfectly.  
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure; make; make install in a Unix system lacking libtool.
>Fix:
See above ... use ./libtool (or add the base compile dir to the search rules).
