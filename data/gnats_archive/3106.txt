>Environment:
Apache 1.3.2 - Windows NT - Binary download
>Description:
As described in http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html an update of Apache
 in an existing directory will NOT overwrite files.

According to http://www.apache.org/info/three-config-files.html - I used
 AccessConfig /dev/null and ResourceConfig /dev/null directives in httpd.conf
 and deleted access.conf and srm.conf.

When upgrading, new versions of access.conf and srm.conf are saved as
 access.conf.default and srm.conf.default, but srm.conf and access.conf
 are created altogether.

Hoping this helps.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache, unite conf file, delete access.conf and srm.conf,
 then reinstall.
>Fix:
No, sorry.

State-Changed-When: Sun Oct 25 18:43:56 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
A recent change to have the 3 file legacy has ceased,
and the 3 files have been intelligently merged into httpd.conf
so this should solve your problem.  Well the srm.conf and access.conf
files still exist, but then just have pointers to httpd.conf
Thanks for using APache.
