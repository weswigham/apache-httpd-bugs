>Description:
When I attempted to compile Apache on a RedHat 6.0 system, the compiler complained that it could not find 'ndbm.h' included in src/modules/standard/mod_auth_dbm.c

When I looked for the file I found it is a glibc header and it was in /usr/include/db1/ which is not in the include search path. So I changed 
#include <ndbm.h>
 to 
#include <db1/ndbm.h>

and it compiled.

I assume this is because RH uses glibc2.1 which might have had a bit of a layout change, and that no-one has reported this because RH comes with an Apache rpm (which coincidentally does not have DSO support).

I have not tested the auth_dbm module after this fix (I have no idea how to).
>How-To-Repeat:
I assume this will happen when compiling apache with DSO and the auth_dbm module on a Redhat 6.0 system.

This should do it:

./configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max && make
>Fix:
Change line 77 in src/modules/standard/mod_auth_dbm.c from
#include include <ndbm.h>
 to 
#include <db1/ndbm.h>

and recompile
