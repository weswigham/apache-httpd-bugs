>Description:
Can not load apache httpd
all previous versions have compiled and built fine on this system
starting with 0.8xx to most recently 1.2b7

Configure is run with stock Makefile.tmpl with 
mod-info an mod-status turned ON (this is the identical to
makefile.tmpl I used for 1.2b7)
all config files are from 1.2b7 installation

No errors are evident during the make

Upon issuing the load command, the following occurs:

pandora:# /usr/src/apache_1.2b8/src/httpd -f conf/httpd.conf
pandora:# shmget: Function not implemented
httpd: Could not call shmget
>How-To-Repeat:
I can put anything you need from my system on my ftp site, however the
server in question is for my own use (internal) and is not connected to the
internet directly.

 Aie.  linux 1.2.13 doesn't have shared memory apparently.  In httpd.h
 search for LINUX then find the line after it saying "HAVE_SHMGET" and
 delete that line.  I'll see if I can work out something automatic.

State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: jim
State-Changed-When: Sun Apr 13 14:01:45 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Previous versions of Apache used mmap for Linux, not
the SysV shared-memory functions. It looks like although
these are to be found in your C libs, they are not enabled
in your kernal: You can add them or go back to mmap()
State-Changed-From-To: analyzed-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sat Apr 19 14:01:46 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed in 1.2b9-dev by reverting to old non-shm behaviour by
default and requiring user to select shm if they want it.
