>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Please add the words "Server Push" to the description of FAQ 33 relating to
the "nph-" script naming convention.  The server push examples from Netscape
and several HTML books did not work on my Linux system.  The problem was
buffering.  A workaround is "nph-" but since server push is not mentioned
searches do not lead to FAQ 33.

Could the server be modified so that if it sees "multipart" as a type it
turns off buffering for the current connection?

Could the server be modified so that when it sees the boundry string of
a multipart page it flushes its buffers%3

 Try apache 1.3b2 if you can.  This is fixed there, it won't be fixed in
 1.2.
