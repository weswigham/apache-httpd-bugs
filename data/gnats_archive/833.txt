>Environment:
Irix 6.3 R10000 running on an O2
uname -a = IRIX cm 6.3 12161207 IP32
>Description:
As perl is compiled with "-n32" libraries in irix, mod_perl wants apache to also be compiled with the same options so that perl can be linked into it. Perl includes the compilation mode in the CC variable, as in 'cc -n32'. When mod_perl  tells apache to compile, the generated makefiles contain calls to "make CC=cc -n32". Note the absence of quote marks around 'cc -n32'. Make bombs as it takes -n32 as an unrecognized option. 
>How-To-Repeat:
in the mod_perl directory:
perl Makefile.PL; answer the questions
"make" when finished
>Fix:
I fixed the problem by adding quotes around $(CC) in:

  - Changed in apache/src/Makefile.tmpl:

    regex/libregex.a:
	(cd regex; $(MAKE) lib CC='$(CC)' AUX_CFLAGS='$(CFLAGS)' RANLIB='$(RANLIB)')

    modules/last-built:
	(cd modules; \
	$(MAKE) CC='$(CC)' AUX_CFLAGS='$(CFLAGS)' RANLIB='$(RANLIB)')

  - Changed in apache/src/Configure

    \$(MODULES): ForceMe
	(cd \$@; \$(MAKE) 'CC=\$(CC)' AUX_CFLAGS='\$(MOD_CFLAGS)' RANLIB='\$(RANLIB)')

Hope this helps%2

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a problem with the base Apache package, but
with mod_perl.  The CC macro is intended to be the name
of the compiler - and nothing else.  It is *not* supposed
to include any compiler flags.  Those should be indicated
in the EXTRA_CFLAGS macro.

That's the right way to do it.  However, quoting the macro
does no harm, so I've committed the change to the 1.3
development tree.  Thank you for reporting this, and for
using Apache!
