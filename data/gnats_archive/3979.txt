OSF1 vmax V4.0 564 Alpha gcc 2.7
>Description:
Scripts in the main cgi-bin directory are executed (giving the expected result).
Scripts in the user cgi-bin directory are not executed (giving the cgi source).
In our config-file we've put the following:
<Directory /wtcm/users/*/users_www/cgi-bin>
 AllowOverride All
 Options ExecCGI
</Directory>
In our current version (Apache 1.2.3) it just works fine.
