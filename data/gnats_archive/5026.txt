>Description:
Hi, the following snippet of code works fine standalone, but crashes
JServ when used in JSP압 or in Servlets. I았e verified the error using
GSP, GNU jsp (both 1.0cvs and 0.9.10) and a servlet. 

The snippet of code works fine with sun압 reference implementation
jwsdk, and when running it standalone, so it압 probably not a problem
with Weblogic압 application server. 


>How-To-Repeat:
this is the standalone program that works: 

import javax.naming.*;
import javax.ejb.*;
import javax.jts.*;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.util.*;
import java.sql.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.util.*;

public class JServBug {

    static String lacName = "reinhard";
    static String lacPassword   = "";
    static String busId	= "052";
    static String weblogicUrl = "t3s://history.andsold.de:7004";


    public static void main (String args[]) {
	System.out.println("Hello world");

	try {
	    Properties p = new Properties();
	    p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,
		  "weblogic.jndi.TengahInitialContextFactory");
	    p.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, weblogicUrl);
	    InitialContext ctx  = new InitialContext(p);
	} catch (Exception e) {
	    System.out.println (e.getMessage()); 
	}
    }
}

Running that page results in the following messages being written to 
the jserv log file:

If you need more information I앇 be happy to provide it. 
>Fix:
No, not at the moment. As we need to use SSL we cannot use Sun압 
implemenatation, but it won앖 work with Apache/JServ... looks like
a catch-22. 

Keep up the good work, and again, if I can be of any help, I앏l try
my very best.

 The problem has been "solved" by running jserv in standalone 
 mode and not having apache start its process on bootup. Still,
 I think this is a bug. I took me nearly three days of hacking
 and trying out various versions of operating systems, gsp/jsp
 implementations and version numbers, hacking java examples to
 pinpoint the offending statement and so on and so on. 
 
 I wonder if maybe this might be a timeout problem of some 
 sort, so that servlet headers did not get returned quickly 
 enough and jserv registering this as a crash of some sort.
 
 Everything works now, so I guess the severity can be reduced
 to "normal" or whatever you see fit, and maybe a BIG warning
 sign in the jserv documentation is appropriate to having
 apache launch the jserv engine.
 
 Regards & keep up the good work, 
 
 Uwe

 Uwe,
 
 A fix like what you found generally means that some environment variables
 are not correctly being passed around in manual mode on vs. manual mode off.
 In other words, the JVM started manually gets the environment variables of
 the user who started the JVM. In the care of the httpd starting the JVM, the
 variables passed in are those of the user the httpd is running under
 (generally "nobody") and thus there are not as many variables set correctly.
 
 I hope that opens some new ideas for you regarding solving the problems.
