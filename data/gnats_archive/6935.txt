>Description:
My web server environment is like: 
   apache_1.3.12
   apache_1.3.12+ssl_1.41
   openssl-0.9.6
 
My problem is when I try access to my web server (https://203.254.120.11) using IE(Internet Explorer) with 40-bit
security level, the browser display a message that it cannot locate the web server or DNS error.
If I tried the same using IE with 56-bit or 128-bit, it can be accessible. 
Another interesting thing is under the environment (apache_1.3.6, apache_1.3.6+ssl_1.35, openssl_0.9.3a)
the web server can be accessible with 40-bit IE.
 
My concern is what causes the problem and how to make it work.

Sorry, but since we are not responsible for the SSL
module that you are using, there is no way for us
to help you with this.  Please contact the people
from which you obtained the SSL module.
Thanks for using Apache!
