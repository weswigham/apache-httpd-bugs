>Description:
1. MultiViews is a great feature of apache!
2. but there is a small problem..

The problem in short description:

 - server has multiviews switched on (an it's working fine)
 - a directory has e.g. two files:
        doc.htm.de
        doc.htm.en

 - Server config is set as follows:
    AddLanguage de .de
    AddLanguage en .en
    ... etc.            
    LanguagePriority de en fr se 


- requesting "doc.htm" returns:
>How-To-Repeat:
Replace Accept-Language in Browser by one rarely used language...

State-Changed-Why:
That's how the HTTP protocol works.  See RFC2068 for a description
of Accept-Language.  Essentially, the user specifying
"Accept-Language: af" says they only read af.  If they
had said "Accept-Language: af, *" then it would mean they
read and prefer af, but will take anything in a pinch.

We can't provide an option to override this -- that would
violate the protocol.

>Unformatted:
>>Not Acceptable
>>An appropriate representation of the requested resource doc.htm could not be found on this server.
>>Available variants: 
>>     doc.htm.de , type text/html, language de 
>>     doc.htm.en , type text/html, language en 

Important:
 This Message will only be returned, if the Accept-Language-Header
 sent by the browser doesn't contain any known Add-Type language
 There is no Accept-Lang-Header info apache returns the docs acording to
 the LangPriotity.

 e.g. Accept: en,de       ==> works fine returns "en"
      Accept: <empty>     ==> according LangPriority
      Accept: "af"        ==> Yek! Not Acceptable Error

If this ("Not Acceptable") is a feature, there should be a switch, to
prefere LanguagePriority in any case - instead of sending a "Not Acceptable".
