Subject: ReWriteEngine On not inherited from general server config into virtual host config.

/opt/web/servers/unicycle/apache wumpus # uname -a
SunOS wumpus 5.5.1 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,Sun_4_600
(this machine is www.ukoln.ac.uk)

Built using Gcc, noting special added in, no tinkering.
>Description:
Our httpd.config goes something like this:

# General server stuff:
listen 138.38.32.10:80
# Allow use of mod_rewrite
RewriteEngine on
RewriteLog "/opt/web/servers/unicycle/apache/logs/rewrite.log"
RewriteLogLevel 3
# Restrict privilages.
User nobody
Group nogroup
HostnameLookups on
[..etc..]

<virtualhost _default_>
    # Config for www.ukoln.ac.uk, ukoln.ac.uk, ukoln.bath.ac.uk etc.
    [...etc...]
    # map home directories onto other machine:
    ReWriteRule ^/~(.*)              http://homes.ukoln.ac.uk/~$1
    [...etc...]
</virtualhost>

[...etc...]

We found that the rewiteRule wasn't getting executed.  When we put
"ReWriteEngine On" *inside* the virtual host config, it worked.  The docs
say that the ReWriteRule directive is suitable for the server config, so
I assumed it would be inherited by the virtual hosts.
>How-To-Repeat:
I can send you our server configs before and after fixing it ourselves if you
want.
>Fix:
Either change mod_rewrite so that once the engine is turned on in general
config then it is on in the Vhosts (unless specifically turned off in them?)
*or* say in the docs that it needs to be turned on in each one.

 And, as I forgot to note in the previous note, this should get updated in
 the docs sometime soon.
