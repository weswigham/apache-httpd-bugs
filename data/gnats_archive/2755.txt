>Description:
When I switched from Apache 1.2.6 to 1.3.x the "#exec cmd" include commands didn't worked any more.

No error is given into the errors logs or the HTML page. Simply no output is generated.

I tried with different commands, changing the directory e chmodding them 777. No results at all.

I noticed a bug report already exists with these simptoms but is specific for NT. Now I esperienced it on OpenBSD.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply try any "exec cmd" includes command.
>Fix:
I could change all my (numerous) pages to use "exec cgi", but I wasn't able to pass arguments tho cgis (the '?' didn't worked).

State-Changed-Why:
It works just fine for me.

Do other SSI directives work in the same page?

If you look at the source of the page generated, does it
still contain the SSI directives unparsed?

Give an example of an exec cmd you are trying to use.

 See the docs; use "include virtual" if you want to execute something with
 a query string or path info.

 Are you sure you are viewing the source and not the parsed HTML?

 Again, please give an example.  An exact example of what you are putting
 in your file that you think should be parsed.

 Oops...
 OK, now I changed all my pages, so the problem isn't any longer very
 important to me...

 Hu???
 What is the difference?
 I used the "View/Page Source" menu of Netscape Communicator...

 I used lines like the following:
 
      <!--#exec cmd="/wwwdocs/cgi-bin/ads-insert it hr"-->
 
 I tried to move the command in many different directory, also the
 current one.
 The command works used in a shell.
 I also tried to change the command with a simple shell script with only
 a "echo hello" line.
 I tied also to set 777 permissions.
 
 And finaly keep in mind that these commands worked perfectly until I
 moved from apache 1.2.x to 1.3.x.
 
 Bye,
