>Description:
The comment for the config_log_state says:
 * config_log_state holds the status of a single log file. fname cannot
 * be NULL.
However, this is no longer true.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Rewrite the comment to read "fname can be NULL, meaning that this module
does no logging for this virtual host."
