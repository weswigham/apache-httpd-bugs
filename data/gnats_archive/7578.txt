>Release:        Apache 1.3.17(Win32)
>Organization:
>Environment:
Win 98, version 4.10.2222
>Description:
I think this is problematic of MS-Windows applications, but maybe some awareness is warranted.

Among the files held open (and, as I discovered, cannot be deleted) are these files:
%WINDOWS%\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\index.dat
%WINDOWS%\Cookies\index.dat
%WINDOWS%\History\History.IE5\index.dat
... where %WINDOWS% is repalced with the directory Windows was installed to.

With a system tool, I found the Apache.exe process has 12 filehandles, 3 to these files and 9 to the expected access.log/error.log logfiles.

>How-To-Repeat:
Install Internet Explorer 5.x on a Windows box (haven't tried it with NT or 2000).
Install Apache 1.3.17(Win32) on the Windows box.
Start Apache.
Try to delete any of the mentioned index.dat files.
>Fix:
I don't think it needs fixing, but it may indicate that the network system calls in Windows OSes depends very heavily on their Internet Explorer product (q.q.v.: Department of Justice).  Might merit a comment in the source to warn future developers of problems that may occur.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed

State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 10:54:59 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Since this applies specifically to the pre-NT versions, I'm
closing the report as insignificant, seeing as we don't
recommend using pre-NT OS's (9x/ME) ever in any sort of
production environment.
