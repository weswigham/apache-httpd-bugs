>Environment:
HP-UX 10.20, HP ANSI-C compiler 10.32.07
>Description:
If someone omits the trailing slash for a directory index, apache send
a temporary redirect command (status 302). However, these are not cachable
by caching proxy servers. Replacing it by status 301 (permanent redirect)
would make them cachable.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ telnet www.apache.org http
GET /images HTTP/1.0


This responds with:
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
