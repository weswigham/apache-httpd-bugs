>Environment:
FreeBSD 3.3-RELEASE #19
with custom-made thread library

>Description:
In server/mpm/threaded.c, clean_child_exit calls apr_pool_destroy to free
reousrces. In thread-system which lets multiple threads run simultaneously
using kernel-threads, this can cause worker_thread to die with SEGV if he
is touching pchild pool.

Not critical, but causes superfluous coredumps.

>How-To-Repeat:
Send SIGTERM to running apache. Apache must be built with thread-system
which supports kernel-thread, such as linuxthreads.
>Fix:
signal-handler thread should die more gracefully.

The threaded.c MPM is no longer part of Apache 2.0.  A
replacement, worker.c MPM, has this and other problems
resolved.

Please try a new level of Apache 2.0.
