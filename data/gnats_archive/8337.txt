>Description:
Hi,

I am now running Apache 1.3.20 (Unix) on FreeBSD 4.4-RC and have been
noticing that the Apache error log is filling its self rapidly with the
following warnings:

httpd in malloc(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in malloc(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in malloc(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in malloc(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in malloc(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in free(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in free(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in free(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in free(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in free(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in free(): warning: recursive call.
httpd in free(): warning: recursive call.

The error log reports no SIGSEGVs.

I updated from Apache 1.3.18 to see if this would resolve the issue.
Originally, as this warning was manifesting in the error log, httpd was also
bringing our server to a halt while it ate memory like mad.  It is no longer
(for the time being) eating memory, but the warning persists.

 To add:
 
 After further searching of the error log, after noticing that httpd
 was rapidly diving up memory usage for no apparent reason I noticed
 this prior to pages of  warnings of malloc() and free() in recursive
 calls:
