>Environment:
Linux eris 2.0.36 #2 Wed Dec 16 14:11:21 CST 1998 i686 unknown
(redhat 5.2)
>Description:
If any of {iconsdir, htdocsdir, cgidir} is left undefined in the 
install layout, 'make install-data' blithely attempts to install
the default data tree in /.  Because make install-data does a
'find $(htdocsdir)/ -exec chmod a+rx', doing make install (esp. 
as root) can lead to Evil Badness.

Makefile and/or configure should probably complain and/or die
if any of the paths in the layout are left undefined.

More background:
Attempting to upgrade from 1.3.4 to 1.3.6, I followed the same
install steps I had before, including reusing the layout file from
my previous install.  I was unpleasantly surprised when 'make install'
started chmodding seemingly random files.  While I noticed this 
problem attempting to install 1.3.6, I did not chase it down 
immediately (1.3.9 was already out at the time), but stuck with my
stable 1.3.4 install.  I've now confirmed that the problem persists
in 1.3.11.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --with-layout=foo:bar; make; make install
with layout in foo:
<Layout bar>
    prefix:        /tmp/apache_test
    exec_prefix:   $prefix
    bindir:        $exec_prefix/bin
    sbindir:       $exec_prefix/sbin
    libexecdir:    $exec_prefix/libexec
    mandir:        $prefix/man
    sysconfdir:    $prefix/etc/conf
    datadir:       $prefix/etc
    #iconsdir:      $prefix/etc/icons
    #htdocsdir:     $prefix/etc/htdocs
    #cgidir:        $prefix/etc/cgi-bin
    includedir:    $prefix/include
    localstatedir: $prefix/etc
    runtimedir:    $localstatedir/run
    logfiledir:    $localstatedir/log
    proxycachedir: $localstatedir/proxy
</Layout>
