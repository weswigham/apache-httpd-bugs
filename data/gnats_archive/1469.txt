Linux 2.0.30
>Description:
If suexec is run from the command line in directory dir, with a target command
of subdir/script.cgi, tests will be done on dir and on script.cgi, but not
on subdir, which may therefore be owned by someone else, world-writable, etc.

It seems that suexec would always be called by Apache with working directory
subdir in this case, so the security hole matters only when suexec is run from
the command line, as far as I know.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
Some protection is given by installing suexec with ownership root/httpd (server
running as httpd/httpd) and permissions 4710, not 4711 as suggested. I recommend
changing this in the documentation anyway. Note that if any scripts are run
without suexec (i.e. as httpd/httpd) then they will still be able to call suexec
themselves. Along with this, therefore, it should be recommended that a
<VirtualHost _default_> with User cgi and Group cgi (say) is always used
with suexec.

It would be even better to disallow '/' completely from the target command.
(Patch available on request.) This relies on suexec being passed the relative
pathname of the target command, which is what (at present) Apache does

 Correction to the above: a user who is not the HTTPD_USER (httpd in the
 example) is prevented from running suexec anyway, even if it is
 executable for them. So the point about file permissions is not
 important. The real aim is to hinder any hacker who breaks through
 Apache, in which case they will (or may) be the HTTPD_USER. For this
 purpose the VirtualHost _default_ and '/' comments still apply.
