State-Changed-Why:
Are you absolutely sure the ServerName directive is
set (eg. not commented out, etc.)?

Do you have any VirtualHost sections in the config?  Could
it be using one of them?

 Yes ServerName IS set.
 
 Yes I do use VirtualHost with SUEXEC. I let the proxy/firewall decide from the path of the
 URL, which hostalias to send to.
 httpd.conf:
 NameVirtualHost dorothea
 
 <VirtualHost fswebhost>
 ...
 </VirtualHost>
 
 <VirtualHost fsintra>
 ...
 </VirtualHost>

 Do you have the proper ServerName set in each vhost?

 No I have not set ServerName in the two VirtualHost's. I have set ServerName
 in the global scope, which also should be the one that matches the given query,
 AND the one (NameVirtualHost=dorothea) that the server replies back with, see
 bug-report.

 Are you sure you properly understand how the vhosts work?  If you have a
 NameVirtualHost directive for an IP, then no requests to that IP will go
 to the main server at all.
 
 I strongly suspect your problem is not setting the ServerName in the vhost
 that ends up handling the request.

      If you have one IP, as clearly stated in the vhost docs, then the main
      server will not be used, and the first vhost for that IP will be used for
      all nonmatching vhosts.  Normally, one of the few places where the
      ServerName is used is in sending redirects, so it isn't suprising you
      don't see it elsewhere.  You need to fix your vhost configs so that the
      proper servername is in the vhost that is being used, or add another name
      based vhost at the start if you want that to be used for requests that
      don't match one of the two existing ones.
 
 Hi, I have now changed my config following your guidelines, and it works! Thanks!
 I expected ServerName to carry into vhost sections - but apparently it was the
 NameVirtualHost that did.
 
 I will probably try to add a vhost _default_ to grap these cases.
 
 About name-based vhosts - you are right that the doc states that, but if you look
 under the doc. of <VirtualHost> you will see the following sentence:
 
      The special name _default_ can be specified in which case this virtual host will match any IP address that is
      not explicitly listed in another virtual host. In the absence of any _default_ virtual host the "main" server
      config, consisting of all those definitions outside any VirtualHost section, is used when no match occurs.
 
 
 Thanks again!
