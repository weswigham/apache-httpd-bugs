Fully-patched BSDI 2.1
# uname -a
BSD/OS global.dca.net 2.1 BSDI BSD/OS 2.1 Kernel #1: Thu May  8 09:49:22 EDT 199

I have tried gcc 1.4.2 and 2.7.2 to no avail.
>Description:
httpd-1.2b10 will run, and accept connections to port 80.
It works fine when less than 128 virtualhosts are defined
in httpd.conf.  When > 128 are set up, connections to port
80 are still accepted but httpd does not respond to any
requests.  Nothing is written to any log file.

I am not using any Listen directives in httpd.conf; I have
separate log files defined for each virtual host.
This is the same or similar as bug report 295.

Compile it under BSDI 2.1 and define > 128 vhosts :-)
>Fix:
It would have to be something with how VirtualHosts code changed
between v1.1.3 and 1.2, but I'm not a C programmer :-%2

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly a file descriptor limitation as
described in:

	http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#fdlim

This is normal and not an Apache problem.

You imply that it _does_ work better under 1.1.x.  Are you
sure of that?  How many virtual hosts (well, logfiles) did
you have working under 1.1.x?

 This isn't the first report of the below.  Probably worth looking into.

 Hi Marc,
 
 Thanks for your note.
 
 Apache 1.1.3 does indeed work fine on my system with the 293 VirtualHosts
 -- whereas 2.0b10 fails.  It is _not_ a file descriptor limitation; I
 start Apache with this script: 
 
 #!/bin/csh
 limit max unli
 limit open unli
 /local/etc/httpd/httpd
 
 So I am setting the file descriptor limitation to unlimited.  I also have 
 used sysctl to set kern.maxfiles to its maximum value.  The problem
 seems related only to the 1.1.3 -> 2.0b10 upgrade.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
