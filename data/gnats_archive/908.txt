State-Changed-When: Fri Aug  1 03:00:18 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Some people have been looking at it.  It is a desirable feature.
So it may be supported ... it depends on how easy it is to coax
certain programs to co-operate.  Apache has other alternatives,
such as mod_perl and php/fi.

 Understandable about the undocumented calls. Are you working with anyone
 at Microsoft on interoperability?
 
 If this is a feature that you do plan to implement, I would be willing
 to clear up a dev machine for some test scenarios.  Most of my work is
 ASP and ISAPI based, and I am a strong advocate of "platform diversity"
 in development, so your server interests me.

 Not to my knowledge. While many of us feel that ASP support would be a
 useful thing to have, I don't think anyone currently has the resources of
 the desire to make it work, which would likely take a lot of effort.
 
 If you'd like to try, that'd be great, but as far as I know, there has
 been no real work done regarding ASP support for Apache, and I don't
 believe anyone has any firm plans to do so.

 If I do come up with a component, is Apache going to market it for me?
 :-)
