Any
>Description:
In the documentation on NCSA's server, there is a referer directive
allowed under <Limit> (see the following URL for more info:
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/access/referer.html).
This restricts access to a document based on the referred page.
I am unaware of any similar feature in Apache, and this seems
important enough to be placed on the list of discrepancies
between Apache and NCSA's server.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Implement it (the preferred choice) or document the difference
not only in differences between Apache and NCSA, but also in some of the
documentations on Access control.

(I ask that a copy of any response to this to be e-mailed to support@prado.com.%2

 I think this is already possible in 1.3a2.  Using mod_setenvif you can:
 
 SetEnvIf Referer "regex that matches referers you're interested in" DENY
 deny from env=deny
 
 You can probably do the same thing in 1.2 using mod_rewrite to set an
 environment variable and then using allow/deny from env=varname.
 
 But yeah it should be documented.
