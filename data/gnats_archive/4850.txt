>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0, sun JDK 1.7, sun jsdk 2.0.
>Description:
I noticed that using the setMaxAge(0) method doesn't delete a cookie as it should on this release and platform.  
I tested this on a linux version of apache/JServ and it works OK.  Tested with Netscape 4.61 on windows and also Netscape 4.07 on linux.
The only way I can delete the cookie is to use a "very near" future expire value such as setMaxAge(1).  
I believe the jsdk2.0 documenation for the Cookie class for setMaxAge states that to delete a cookie, use a value of 0.  To create a non-disk cookie, use a value in the past.  And all future dates will expire as they are reached. 
I can email you a very simple, self containing stand alone servlet to demonstrate this if you would like.  Please respond to the email above for any further info.
Thanks for the work you do; Apache/Jserv is wonderful.        
>How-To-Repeat:
email request for simple servlet to theforest@netscape.net.
>Fix:
no, sorry.  It is happening on apache 1.3.6/jserv1.0 on NT.  DOES NOT happen on apache 1.3.3/jserv1.0b3 on linux.

david responded in private email that his issue is resolved...

you are correct.  this is the same issue that I have.  I applied the patches
as specified to our JServ source and it works fine.

i have to say that your response time on this issue was absolutly incredible. 
i have never gotten a response this quickly and this exact in all my dealings
in the software industry.

i certainly appreciate it, thanks very much.
