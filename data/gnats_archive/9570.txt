apache
>Environment:
Solaris 8 x86, latest patch cluster. Compiler GCC 2.95.3. Apache 1.3.22 with mod_ssl, and php 4
>Description:
I am mirroring a site that uses includes. The directory settings are

<Directory /home/somedir>
    Options IncludesNOEXEC SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
    AllowOverride None
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

Virtual Host settings are

<VirtualHost    x.x.x.x>
DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.shtml
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
DocumentRoot    /home/somedir
ServerName      foo.bar
LogLevel warn
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
LogFormat "%{Referer}i -> %U" referer
LogFormat "%{User-agent}i" agent
CustomLog /var/log/weblogs/pss.access_log combined
ErrorLog  /var/log/weblogs/pss.error_log
php_admin_value doc_root "/home/somedir"
php_admin_flag safe_mode on
php_admin_value open_basedir "."
</VirtualHost>

The main page, index.shtml calls multiple include files like so:

<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=1 width="100%">
<!--#include file="page1.html" -->
</table>

...

<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=1 width="100%">
<!--#include file="page7.html" -->
</table>

Inlcude file pages 1-3 work fine. Pages 4 and on are in some wierd encoding. Exmaple

>How-To-Repeat:
please email me for the url (email in this form) this is a mirror and until working properly i do not want to open it to potential attacks if this is more than a minor issue.
>Fix:
no idea ive tried setting options all in the httpd.conf file with no affect. Also checking google showed nothing. Though in the apache bug report database there are two other include issues one being PR 9473 that is similar sounding but with another dependency (proxypass) which is not being used here.

 I also have tried making the shtml configurations global and removed them
 from the directory and virtual settings of the site area only.
 
 same results
 
 Also the browsers testing are IE6 and Netscape 6

 ok found the cause. i dont know if its apache or just something i wasnt
 aware of.
 
 the includes that didnt come up were files with the execute bits set. some
 of the files didnt have those bits set and would work.
 
 strange since they arent executing anything. they were just simple
 includes.
 
 this occured with options Includes and with IncludesNoexec as well
