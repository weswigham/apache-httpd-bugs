When someone hits my site with an MSIE 3.0 (Win95) browser, I receive
the following error msg - "Instruction at memory address referenced
memory at 0x0000000. The memory could not be written"

(The memory address changes) Also, don't know if other MSIE
browsers have the same effect.  From the users side, the browser
just hangs.

I do not see the same problem with any other browser (have tried many
different Netscape's and even AOL)

 The access log is normal (Everything that should be logged is there).
 The error log produces some interesting results. Last night I produced
 quite a few of the following errors:
 
 [Fri Jan 23 23:32:40 1998] [warn] (2)No such file or directory: select
 claimed we could write, but in fact we couldn't. This is a bug in
 Windows.
 
 Unfortunately, when I cause the same error this morning, I don't see
 anything being
 written to the error log, so I can't be 100% sure that the problem I
 reported is
 the reason this is in the error log.

 We have a potential fix for this problem.
 
 The .conf distribution files contain the following:
 
 # The following directive disables keepalives and HTTP header flushes
 for
 # Netscape 2.x and browsers which spoof it. There are known problems
 with
 # these
 BrowserMatch Mozilla/2 nokeepalive
 
 If I comment out the above BrowserMatch line, MSIE 3.0 and Netscape
 2.0 (which does break, but was not noted in my original bug) work fine.
 
 I'm not sure of the ramifications of doing this though...

Okay, so apparently either nokeepalive or BrowserMatch is
broken on Win32.  I've added this to our project status
page, so when a Win32 has time they'll get around to 
fixing this.  If you happen to find a fix let us know.  
Thanks!

Can you please verify whether this is still a problem

 Erm... are you running mod_perl on the server in question, or any other
 added modules?
 
 Exactly what thread in the modperl mailing list talks about this?

 Marc --
 
 Found the thread. It's at
 http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/modperl/prehplibli
 Notice that the last post by Ron Hawkins fixes the problem.
 
 Mine was a little different. My .conf says:
 
 # The following directive disables keepalives and HTTP header flushes for
 # Netscape 2.x and browsers which spoof it. There are known problems with
 # these
 #BrowserMatch Mozilla/2 nokeepalive
 
 (commented out the BrowserMatch....)
 
 So, I'm guessing that this has been fixed?

 That is a completely different problem that has nothing to do with Apache
 crashing.

 Again, are you running mod_perl on the server?  If so, and you can't
 reproduce it without mod_perl, then I have to suggest it is likely
 mod_perl causing the problem.
