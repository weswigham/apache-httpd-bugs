Linux aegis 2.2.16-1.wl.msn2.bfw.bren.1 #1 Wed Jun 28 03:08:24 EDT 2000 i686 unknown
>Description:
Internally, we have two ways of adding configuration directives to the httpd.conf
when an apache add-on is done:  the first way is to patch the httpd.conf file on
the fly (either to include other files or the statements themselves) or a new 
method I'm working on.  This new method is to define a configuration directory
that apache will read on (re)load to determine its configuration.  The code
included will modify a 1.3.12 source tree so that any include configuration
directive can also search directories and include entire directories of 
small config files.  I've finished the linux development and reformatted in 
the apache style.  I think that this problem woul dbe the most secure means of 
doing some kind of mass inclusion.  It's a lot like /etc/rc.d/init/ .

 >Fix:
 Shouldn't ap_is_symlink() use lstat() instead of stat()?
