Netscape Navigator 4.03 for Win95
>Description:
I searched the bug reports and posted on USENET for two days w/o reply.

Netscape Navigator 4.x returns an index.htm page as plain text from /docs directory, but the exact same page works under NCSA httpd v1.5.2a on an AIX 4.2 system, and on the same Linux/Apache system in a /test directory.  Permissions are identical on both Apache server HTML files and directories.  Fully specifying the page as /docs/index.htm in the URL also returns the web page properly.

MSIE and Lynx do not exhibit this problem; the page returns as text/html.  I've checked BrowserMatch, AddType, and other configuration entries, but have not found a configuration error that explains this behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compare Apache 1.2.5/Netscape Navigator 4.0x results for http://perigee.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/, http://perigee.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/index.htm, and http://perigee.ncdc.noaa.gov/test/.  The NCSA server is at http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/.

This is an auto-forwarding page (meta expire tag) after five seconds.  The page links in the Apache /test directory are broken.
>Fix:
No.  Either this is a very obscure bug, or a strange configuration error.  Your assistance would be appreciated!  I added 'BrowserMatch "^Mozilla/[2-4]" force-response-1.0' in httpd.conf just in case this was a 1.1 compatibility issue, but the problem remains.  Thanks%2

 Apache is doing the right thing.
 
 When I visit with navigator 4.x running on linux I have no problem either.

 Thanks for the quick response!
 
 Did you try the URL "http://perigee.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/" exactly as shown
 for Navigator, no "index.htm" specified?  It's the DirectoryIndex handling
 that I'm worried about.  Only in that directory, and only with Navigator.
 
 I checked again.  I get the same "text/plain" display on Navigator 4.03
 (Win95) (two systems) and Navigator 4.04 (Linux, using http:// address
 from localhost). I have not tried accessing the server from an external
 network, though.

 Yup I tried http://perigee.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/ exactly... and just tried
 it again... same thing, I get text/html.   Are there any proxies involved?
 Do your clients use a proxy?

 Sorry, no proxies.
 
 <Giving it another try; checking Netscape Preferences...>
 
 Clearing the caches on both Win95 and Linux Navigators cleared up the
 problem.  I don't remember, but I must not have had the 'AddType text/html
 .htm' in place the first time that I grabbed the page, and I just found
 that the Linux RedHat 5.0 /etc/mime.types does not have 'htm' type
 defined as it did on AIX.
 
 Should have caught this sooner.  Thanks for your time and effort, and
 sorry for the bother!

Yet another victim of redhat 5.0 /etc/mime.types not containing
"htm".
