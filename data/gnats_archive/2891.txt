This error message:

[Sat Aug 22 17:06:15 1998] [crit] (63)File name too long: /theUsers/gerti/www/devel_root/Photos/floppy/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

Photos in this case is a symlinked directory (permissions wide open).

Worked fine with 1.2x apache.

State-Changed-Why:
Your OS is saying that the filename for the htaccess file
is too long.  This is a limitation of your OS; there is nothing
Apache can do about it.  The only reason it worked before
is that Apache silently ignored such errors.  That isn't correct
behaviour, so it doesn't ignore them any more.

You can disable reading htaccess files by setting
"AllowOverride none" for that directory, but since the OS
is saying the path is too long, you probably won't be able to access
any files with names longer than ".htaccess" in that directory.

 But the point is that your OS is telling Apache very clearly that the path
 is too long.  Apache does not do _ANYTHING_ special here; it just tries to
 open a file called .htaccess in the given directory.  If your OS says it
 isn't there, it is happy and goes on.
 
 If your OS returns some unusual error, it has to reject access to be safe.
 Your OS is saying that the pathname is too long; for whatever reason, that
 is your OS's fault.

 Sure, but it is almost certainly not a bug in Apache, but a bug in your
 OS.  Your os is telling Apache that the path is too long.  Perhaps
 whatever filesystem your floppy is on can't support filenames like
 ".htaccess".  
 
 As I said, you can work around this by having Apache not look for htaccess
 files, but the problem isn't in Apache.

 Then that is your problem.

 Yes, as I already said this was changed on purpose.  Ignoring the htaccess
 file if we get an error opening it isn't correct.  The code is in
 http_config.c; look for the error message to see where.

 There is nothing stopping you from setting it in your *.conf files inside
 an appropriate Directory section.
