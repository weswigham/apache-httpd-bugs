linux, but this is just a minor os-independent feature request
>Description:
it would be nice if mod_rewrite provided a variable that contained the two-digit year
like its variables for other date parts %{TIME_MON}, %{TIME_DAY}, etc..
>How-To-Repeat:
design a site that needs two-digit years in the URL and then find out that
mod_rewrite can't do it. :)
>Fix:
Here is a patch against mod_rewrite.c distributed with apache 1.2.5 that will put the
two digit year into %{TIME_SHORTYEAR}

State-Changed-Why:
Uh, you mean we should encourage year 2000 problems?  No way.
You've got a workaround for your setup... but in general this seems
like a bad thing for us to put into the core.
