multiple, including Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, NeXTSTEP 3,3
>Description:
I have an environment in which there is a virtual host defined with an Aliased path from /some/dir to /, and DirectoryIndex set to look for index.cgi. When a script POSTs with an action set to "/" (where index.cgi resides), the request appears as having been a GET method.

I sent this in once before, but didn't see it in a complete search through GNATS.
>How-To-Repeat:
recreate the environment - reasonably simple

 Config directives:
 
 DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi
 ScriptAlias /m/eclips/cgi /e
 
 somefile.html:
 	
 	<form method=POST action="/">
 	...input variables...
 	</form>
 
 Details:
 In '/' resides index.cgi, a symlink to /m/eclips/cgi/uadmin, which
 functions as I would expect when accessed directly. However, when I POST
 to it as '/', the REQUEST_METHOD is in fact GET, no data is sent to
 stdin of the script, and QUERY_STRING is empty.
 
 Let me know if you need anything more.
 
 Thanks!

Can not duplicate in 1.2.0; please resubmit if still present.
Be sure it is not a buggy client giving problems by telnetting
to the HTTP port and making the request yourself.
