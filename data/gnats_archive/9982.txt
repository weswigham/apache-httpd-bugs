 <BR>
 It's almost that time of the year again. That's right - time for
 another material demonstration of your love in the ballet of relentless
 consumption. Why question the ritual when you can react mindlessly and
 predictably? You can get her the cute teddy bear and act out the little
 girl fantasy or get her the chocolates so there will be that much more
 of her to love.
 
 I mock mindlessness because I will always hate the lies that act
 as easy answers and widen the void that modern culture digs for all.
 You are either brave and move forward with noble values or you cower
 to what is easy, dishonest, and comfortable. If 95% of humanity is
 unable to think for itself and merely exists by emulating the ideology
 of commercial culture, what does that say for our collective future?
 Many of these people are good inside, but remain asleep as life merely
 happens to them.<BR>
