>Description:
I just d/l'ed the latest release, and I still can't build apache with mod_rewrite.  make tells me "mod_rewrite.h:133: ndbm.h: No such file or directory".  I've noticed numerous reports of this bug, but none of the fixes have worked for me.  When is this going to go away?!!  I need that module, but ndbm.h is nowhere on my system.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just configure with mod_rewrite and make (on a system like mine).
