result in the same error message:

Bad Request
Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.

State-Changed-Why:
You say ftp in one place, but http in another.
http://user:passwd@site/ should not be recognized because
it is not a valid HTTP url.

ftp://user:passwd@site/ (if you did mean ftp, as you
say later in your message) is valid and does work fine.

 No, it is common practice for a _browser_ to understand that.  It _must_
 translate it internally to a proper HTTP authorization.  If it does not do
 that, then the client is broken.

 It simply isn't a desirable feature.  It adds security risks and there is
 no reason why clients should be doing it. 
 
 What client is behaving this way?
