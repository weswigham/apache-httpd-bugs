SunOS Klaxxon 5.8 Generic_108528-08 sun4u sparc

Solaris 8 running on a Netra X1.  First tried gcc-2.95.3 as a package downloaded from sunfreeware.com, after reading bug # 3157 I downloaded the 2.95.3 source, built it, removed the SunFreeware package and installed the fresh build.  Same error.

Seems to reference the same bug described in # 3157, however as mentioned above I am not using the "incorrect" gcc which closed that bug.

 Upon further investigation it appears to only be a problem with attempting
 to activate-module mod_auth_ldap.c from Muhammad A Muquit dated Sep-20-1999.
 Interestingly this module built and ran just fine with apache 1.3.19 on a
 Solaris 2.7 sparc.

 Ok, the exact problem is that mod_auth_ldap searches for and finds the Sun
 supplied ldap headers in /usr/include and adds -I/usr/include to the
 makefile.  This gets added in the build line before apache's -I../include
 statement and so finds Sun's sprintf headers before the apache ones.  I
 simply copied the ldap.h and lber.h files to the src/include dir and removed
 the logic from mod_auth_ldap.module that added the -I statement and now
 everything is happy.  It seems to me that the solution would be to change
 the Makefile so that src/include is always listed first but I have no idea
 what other things that would break.
