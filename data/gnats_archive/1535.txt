>Description:
I can NEVER remember the exact url to my local mirror-site. So I always have to:
go to: www.apache.org
click on Int'l mirror sites 
and find DK.

How about making a DNS entry for dk.apache.org and have a Redirect to the
actual mirror site there?

So I would always enter: http://dk.apache.org and end up at
http://sunsite.auc.dk/apache/
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add all domains mentioned in http://www.apache.org/mirrors/ as <domain>.apache.org to DNS.
Add a Redirect for each of them.

State-Changed-Why:
Good idea, but DNS can't redirect like that, it would 
have to be something like http://apache.sunsite.auc.dk/.  

Furthermore a "dk.apache.org" would imply some sort of 
official relationship that may not exist.  We haven't 
decided whether to cross that bridge yet.

Thanks for using Apache!

 Naw, we would just need to setup a bunch of vhosts (or mod_rewrite) on a
 single machine that did the redirect.  Problem with that is it is useless
 when the central site is down.

 That is a bigger issue.

 I have set up:  http://www.dk.apache.pi.dk, http://www.de.apache.pi.dk,
 http://www.fi.apache.pi.dk which will redirect you to the mirror-site in
 the given country. Feel free to copy my idea.
