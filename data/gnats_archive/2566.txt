Is this using the system 'sed' ? The patterns used in this
section are pretty basic so I'm unsure why any sed would
have troubles with them.

 What version does "sed -V" report?  What Linux distribution are you using?
 
 Are you _sure_ it isn't something else wrong?  Can you try downloading the
 source from http://www.apache.org/dist/ again and very carefully try
 compiling it without changes?

 sed -V reports gnu sed 2.05.  i believe we're using redhat linux.  i would
 reinstall, but this _is_ a fresh copy of apache.  and, it seems to be
 working with that line commented out.

 You don't have to reinstall, just try compiling again, both so you can be
 sure it wasn't some freak thing and so that you can show the exact errors
 it gives.
 
 The line in question works just fine for me on a Red Hat system using the
 same version of sed, and no one else has reported a problem with it, so we
 really can't do anything about it without further information... removing
 it isn't an option unless we know why it is causing problems.
