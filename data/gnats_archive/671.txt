HP-UX atropos B.10.20 A 9000/803 2006896634 two-user license
>Description:
Directory-based access restrictions also apply to proxy requests, preventing
users to access remote unrestricted documents.
>How-To-Repeat:
On the myhost web server put access restrictions:

<Directory */security>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from mycompany.com
</Directory>

Configure myhost as your web-proxy
then access to http://externalhost/projects/security/

even if externalhost does not restrict access, myhost will refuse to serve the
requested document
>Fix:
by inserting
   if (r->proxyreq) return OK;
at the beginning of
   int check_dir_access (request_rec *r)
in mod_access, you will fix this behaviour

BUT it also disables <Directory proxy:> directives used to restrict access to
the proxy itself %2

State-Changed-Why:
Because of the order in which <Directory> blocks are
processed, this does indeed occur. A possible workaround
is to use virtual hosts listening on different ports, with
separate <Directory> blocks for access control.
