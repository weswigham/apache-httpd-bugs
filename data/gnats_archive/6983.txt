Do not depend on machine environment.
However, environment of this place is SunOS 5.6 Generic_105181-22 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-250.
>Description:
It is assumed that there was the following environment.

              |
              |  (waiting port/80)
    [Port forwarding device] (ex. BIG/ip)
              |
              |  (connecting port/2000)
    [Web Server waiting port 2000]

When I access 'test' directory of DocumentRoot subordinates as 
http://www.domain/test then Server answers it as follows.

% telnet localhost 80
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET http://www.domain/test HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 15 Dec 2000 10:55:52 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)
Location: http://www.domain:2000/test/
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>301 Moved Permanently</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Moved Permanently</H1>
The document has moved <A HREF="http://www.domain:2000/test/">here</A>.<P>
</BODY></HTML>
Connection closed by foreign host.

Because server adds the port number that oneself works and turns over 
"Moved Permanently" when I do port forwarding, error occurs.

>How-To-Repeat:
Please prepare the environment that can access server by a change 
of access port. And access not to add "/" to one directory last.
>Fix:
Add directive to appoint the port number that I want to indicate as
"Moved Permanently" to "httpd.conf".

For example, I add attachment of "ForwardPort 80" in "httpd.conf"
if I add directive of ForwardPort.

The following is patch of that purpose.
#Will it be a right solution method?
