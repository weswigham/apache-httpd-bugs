>Description:
When I go to my site and click on some of the pic links, the output is corrupt near the end of the pic--and this also goes for .ZIP files as well.  I'm not sure if it's the size of the file, or something I am doing wrong, but this image appears corrupt near the bottom when loaded from Apache:

Comment-Added:
The data corruption problem has been acknowledged by Microsoft
to be a bug in XP's afd.sys. There is a hotfix on the way which 
will be referenced via Q317949 in their support Knowledge Base.
That article is currently not online but should be in a 
couple of days. I'll close this when I see that it's available.
When Apache 1.3.24 is released it will address this problem 
without the need for the Hotfix. This corruption also affects 
Apache 2.0 for which the Hotfix is the only current solution.
