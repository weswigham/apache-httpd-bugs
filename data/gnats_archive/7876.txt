apache 1.3.20 w/ php 4.0.5 installed as a static mod
>Description:
I have changed the "PidFile" variable in httpd.conf to 
"/opt/local/logs/httpd.pid," apache starts fine and creates
the pid file in the correct place. But when trying to stop 
apache it still looks for the pid file in the default location!

The following should help:

# ./bin/apachectl start
./bin/apachectl start: httpd started

# ./bin/apachectl stop
./bin/apachectl stop: httpd (no pid file) not running

# more /opt/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf |grep pid
PidFile /opt/local/logs/httpd.pid

# more /opt/local/logs/httpd.pid
470


# truss ./bin/apachectl stop
	.
	.
	.
read(19, "\t E R R O R = 2\n      ".., 128)     = 128
stat64("/opt/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid", 0xFFBEEF20) Err#2 ENOENT
./bin/apachectl stop: httpd (no pid file) not running

Umh... if you change the location of the pidfile, you have
to edit apachectl to tell it where to find it.  This is 
quite clearly laid out within apachectl.

 Hi Marc,
 
 |Umh... if you change the location of the pidfile, you have

 |quite clearly laid out within apachectl.
 
 OK... thats easy enough... however it seems a touch odd that apache 
 will create the httpd.pid file with the path given by httpd.conf, but 
 try and read the httpd.pid file with the path given by apachectl... A 
 comment above each stating you need to change the other would help...
 
 Anyway thanks for the response...
 
 Regards,
 
 Haydn.
