>Description:
I am not certain if this is a bug or normal behvaior.  When you activate 
server-parsed HTML, Apache allows URLs to have extraneous stuff appended to it with a /.  For instance, http://www.a.com/main.html is the real URL, but
http://www.a.com/main.html/blah/junk/foo/bar also returns main.html.

I can see how this might be normal behavior since CGIs allow this, but our search engine is getting mightily confused because of it...
>How-To-Repeat:
This happens on your own site.  For instance:
     http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html/asdkasdasdasdas
Also note that this creates a 
     "[an error occurred while processing this directive]"
error at the top of your page.

That is normal behaviour and is allowed on purpose.
