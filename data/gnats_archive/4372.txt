>Environment:
Ultrix 4.4 on a DEC 5240 (MIPS)  - C compiler irrelevant - doesn't get that far.
>Description:
Here's the output from configure without a trace :-

# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.6
sh: --: bad option(s)

If I trace execution, we see a trace which ends with :-

[snip]
+ eval val=$EXTRA_CFLAGS 
val=
+ [ x != x ] 
+ eval val=$EXTRA_LDFLAGS 
val=
+ [ x != x ] 
+ eval val=$EXTRA_LIBS 
val=
+ [ x != x ] 
+ eval val=$EXTRA_INCLUDES 
val=
+ [ x != x ] 
+ eval val=$EXTRA_DEPS 
val=
+ [ x != x ] 
IFS= 

+ [ x--prefix=/usr/local/apache = x ] 
+ set -- --with-layout=Apache --prefix=/usr/local/apache 
sh: --: bad option(s)
>How-To-Repeat:
Just configure Apache 1.3.6 on Ultrix 4.4.
>Fix:
Yes - use the shell "sh5" rather than "sh". I have read in a Usenet posting that "Ultrix's sh is broken, and it is better to use the more 'historically accurate' alternative System V Bourne shell sh5 which DEC supply for this reason."

If you do that, then configure runs OK (as far as I know).
