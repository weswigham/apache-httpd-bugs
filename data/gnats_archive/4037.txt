Linux Slakware 3.5, Linux RedHat 5.2, GCC as supplied with Linux OS.
>Description:
Part of the output of my search program in diag mode.
env[20]: REQUEST_URI=/cgi-bin/search.exe/images?search_string=diag-env&num_docs=10&lines=10&search_thru=all
env[21]: SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/search.exe
env[22]: PATH_INFO=/images
env[23]: PATH_TRANSLATED=/home/www/images

Aliases as defined in srm.conf file.
Alias /icons/ /usr/local/apache/share/icons/
Alias /linux/ /home/linux/
Alias /images/ /home/www/doc/htmldocs/images/
Alias /srch_pd/ /home/www/srch_pd/
Alias /srch_ivr/ /home/www/srch_ivr/

I would expect that the Path_Translated line should be:
/home/www/doc/htmldocs/images and not /home/www/images

This problem also effects access to the Aliased directories as the browser displaying the search diag output cannot locate the images in the /srch_pd aliased directory.

>How-To-Repeat:
http://ivr.mel.comtech.com.au/cgi-bin/search.exe/images?query=diag-env

This will display the bad PATH_TRANSLATED.
>Fix:
I currently use a search.cfg file as a work around so the search.exe engine can resolve the damaged PATH_TRANSLATED information.

The mod_cgi module needs work but it is beyond me.
I have enough work on my plate getting this site operational.

State-Changed-Why:

The current behaviour is arguably correct.  Please see

Comment-Added:

Further exchanges in private email revealed that the
unexpected behaviour was due to the path-info not matching
the Alias pattern.  Fixing either the path-info or the
Alias so that they matched made things work as expected.
