State-Changed-Why:
User can't read.  Not only did they submit this to the
bug database at the same time they posted to Usenet, but
this isn't even appropriate for the bugdb.

Apache should work fine on your machine, but please don't
fill the bug database with such support questions.

 Please do not as support questions like this on the bugdb, as USENET is
 the place for these.
 
 Thanks for using Apache
