>Description:
Using httpd.conf:
<VirtualHost localhost>
AccessConfig conf/localhost-access.conf
ResourceConfig conf/localhost-srm.conf
</VirtualHost>

Want localhost to NOT parse html files that usually are parsed. Only
solution was to modify conf/localhost-access.conf to use
<Direcory subdir-of-docroot>
Options None

Seems like localhost inherits parsing and I cannot turn it of for
localhost.
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A
>Fix:
I want to turn off parsing but do not see how for the whole docroot

State-Changed-Why:
I told the user about "Options -Includes" and gave examples
of how to set a <Directory /> which restricts everything and
then open up the restriction in specific parts of the hierarchy.
