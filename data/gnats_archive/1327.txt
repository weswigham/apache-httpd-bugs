>Description:
Problem:
-------------
Htaccess files are not respected by Apache in network shared directores
that are aliased using a UNC.
However if I set up an Alias to the same network share using a path
specification to a mapped drive, the htaccess file is respected by Apache. 
The problem with using mapped drives is that you are limited by the number of available drive letters.


For example,  here are several lines from my srm.conf file:
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
# AccessFileName: The name of the file to look for in each directory
# for access control information.

AccessFileName htaccess

# Aliases: Add here as many Aliases as you need (with no limit). The format
is 
# Alias /fakename realname

Alias /unctest/ //winscape/downloads/test/

# The network share above (//winscape/downloads/) was mapped to the
drive letter K
Alias /maptest/ k:/test/
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

.
Within the directory, "test" (Aliased as both /unctest and /maptest), I have a
htaccess file.  The 
htaccess file contains the following: 

<limit GET>
order deny,allow
deny from all
</limit>

My access.conf file has no entries for either Aliased directory above.  
Therefore I expect the aliased directories to 
have "AllowOverride All" set by default.

This htaccess file should cause a "403 Forbidden" 
response from the Apache server when I try to access the directory through
both the 
/unctest/  and /maptest/  aliases.   When I open the  /maptest/ alias from
my browser, I do receive the correct  "403 Forbidden" response from the
Apache server.  

Unfortunately, this is not the case when I open the /unctest/ alias.  The
Apache server returns a directory index.  I can view all 
files (including the htaccess file) even though the htaccess file should
direct Apache to deny 
access to my browser.  Directory access permissions are not a problem here,
because I can open and view the htaccess file 
(URL:  /unctest/htaccess) using my browser.  Therefore, Apache has read access to it.

I have over 120 Aliases to set up for network shares.  Therefore, using the mapped drive approach is not possible.
>How-To-Repeat:
The URL to the directory alias using path to a mapped drive is http://setter.princeton.edu:83/maptest/

The URL to the directory alias using a UNC is http://setter.princeton.edu:83/unctest/

Please do not forget to type in the trailing "/" on the URL.
