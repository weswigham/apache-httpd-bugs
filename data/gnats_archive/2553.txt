>Environment:
uname -a: SunOS aragorn 5.5.1 Generic_103640-01 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
Compiler: gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
This problem was reported earlier as PR 800 for Apache 1.2.x and was
'mysteriously' fixed in the 1.3-beta source tree. The problem did not exist
in 1.3b5 but reappeared in 1.3.0.

When a URL includes the character 'ö', Apache truncates the URL at the position
where the 'ö' character is, and tries to serve that URL to the client. Example:
  http://www.company.com/someöfile.htm
is trucated by Apache 1.3.0 to:
  http://www.company.com/some

Other international character like å, ä, Å, Ä and Ö work just fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file named 'fileö.htm' and try to access from a web running
Apache 1.3.0. I'm sorry for not beeing able to supply a URL for this but our
webserver depends on files containing the character 'ö'. Therefor I have now
downgraded to 1.3b5 as a work-around.
>Fix:
Something must have changed between 1.3b5 and 1.3.0 in the source.
I'm not qualified enough to guess where this change might be though.

State-Changed-Why:
That character is not legal verbatim in URLs.  From RFC1738:

:   No corresponding graphic US-ASCII:
:
:   URLs are written only with the graphic printable characters of the
:   US-ASCII coded character set. The octets 80-FF hexadecimal are not
:   used in US-ASCII, and the octets 00-1F and 7F hexadecimal represent
:   control characters; these must be encoded.

The &ouml; character is ISO-Latin-1 position 246(d), which
is outside the range.  Therefore, this character needs
to be encoded in the URL as %F6.

Thanks for using Apache!

Until someone tracks this down on solaris it should still

Comment-Added:
Try adding "EXTRA_CFLAGS=-funsigned-char" to your Configuration,
reconfiguring and recompiling.

This is a workaround until we cleanup the use of the isspace()/etc.
macros.

 Adding "EXTRA_CFLAGS=-funsigned-char" to my Configuration, reconfiguring
 and recompiling solved the problem for me on Solaris. Thanks!
