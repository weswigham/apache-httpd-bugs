>Originator:     quik@quikbox.ca
>Release:        2.0.16
>Organization:
>Environment:
FreeBSD 4.3-stable with gcc 2.95
>Description:
I got the following error message in my apache errorlog and the server then ceased to fulfill page requests:

[error] server reached MaxClients setting, consider raising the MaxClients setting

The relevent sections of my httpd.conf file are pasted below:

<IfModule prefork.c>
StartServers         5
MinSpareServers      5
MaxSpareServers     10
MaxClients          32
MaxRequestsPerChild  0
</IfModule>

<IfModule threaded.c>
StartServers         3
MaxClients          20
MinSpareThreads      5
MaxSpareThreads     10
ThreadsPerChild     25
MaxRequestsPerChild  0
</IfModule>

>How-To-Repeat:
I would imagine that installing apache2 from the FreeBSD ports collection and sending many requests to the server would reproduce the bug.
>Fix:
I cranked up my maxCliebts setting but that isn't a very elegant solution.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you try this with a version later than 2.0.16?  There
have been many fixes since that release.  None of those
releases have been released as alpha or beta releases, but
they are all available at http://dev.apache.org/dist

If you can test any of those releases, and let us know if
the problem still exists, we would appreciate it.
