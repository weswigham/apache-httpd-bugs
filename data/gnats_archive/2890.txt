>Description:
I'm using the directives ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse

ProxyPass /www_tenfold http://www.10fold.com
ProxyPassReverse /www_tenfold http://www.10fold.com

When I hit the site by doing:
http://nitro.10fold.com/www_tenfold

it only partially works because all relative image source strings that are not
precluded by "www.10fold.com" end up going to "/" on the hosting server using
Apache which has no images directory.  I end up seeing a page that shows tables
but no gifs or images.  It looks broken everywhere.  

Should the directives if used include the use of altering relative paths like
"/images/foo.gif" to "http://www.10fold.com/images/foo.gif"?
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately my companies firewall does not allow you to see the problem but
www.10fold.com is available and you can therefore add the following lines in
your own web server:

ProxyPass /www_tenfold http://www.10fold.com
ProxyPassReverse /www_tenfold http://www.10fold.com

Restart your Apache web server.
With a web browser visit your Apache site with the new changes:
http://[yourserver]/www_tenfold

You will now see the problem as opposed to going directly too:
http://www.10fold.com

Most web sites make the src statements to point at a relative path such as
support.novell.com which has 7 global mirror sites so that they can be mirrored
elsewhere and work independent of the master server being mirrored from.
>Fix:
If these directives are being used, have the web server using the directives,
parse for lines like <img src="/images/foo.gif"> so that relative strings are
altered to absolute paths for links and images etc. so that their precluded
by "http://[sitename]".

State-Changed-Why:
A few hints:

1. > ProxyPass /www_tenfold http://www.10fold.com
   > ProxyPassReverse /www_tenfold http://www.10fold.com
   You should write this with trailing slashes 
   to avoid other problems, i.e.:
   ProxyPass        /www_tenfold/ http://www.10fold.com/
   ProxyPassReverse /www_tenfold/ http://www.10fold.com/

2. > Should the directives if used include the use of altering relative paths like
   > "/images/foo.gif" to "http://www.10fold.com/images/foo.gif"?
   The answer is "no". Because ProxyPass only maps URL
   namespaces and not HTML content. So, when there
   are absolute URLs in the documents referencing
   something aoutside your mapped area you're lost.
   The only solution then is to write a CGI which
   does the document conversion itself. Currently
   for Apache 1.3 there is no way to post-process
   the content.
