>Description:
The problem is related to a delete functionality. The webvisitor has the possibility to delete more than 1 items (messages( at once). He markes the checkboxes of the messages he wants to delete and presses the delete-button. This should result in de deletion of the marked messages. The actual result is the deletion of only one message and espacially the first messages in the row of selected messages. Can this be the resukt of some sort of restriction in the configuration of the Apache server?
