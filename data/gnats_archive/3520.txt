It would be nice, if we could use variables in the config files.
This request is not an urgent one, but would make the config jobs 
sometimes a little easier - especially on large sites (many virtual hosts).

E.g.:

 setvar  MyServerRoot  /webspace/httpd
 setvar  MyMasterDocRoot @@MyServerRoot@@/htdocs

 [...]
 
 <VirtualHost>
   DOCUMENT_ROOT   @@MyMasterDocRoot@@/www.virtual1.dom
   ...
 </...>

 etc.

 (I took @@ as variable delimiter, because it's used in the doc)

State-Changed-Why:
This is now possible with the help of mod_define.
Your "setvar" is named "define" there and
"@@xxx@@" can be written as "${xxx}". You can find it inside
