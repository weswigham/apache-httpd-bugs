 Hi,
 
 A few time ago I was speaking about problem running Apache 1.3.x (above
 1.3.1).  I got message "[emerg] OS2SEM: Error 105 getting accept lock. 
 Exiting!".
 
 I'm running now Apache 1.3.6 under OS/2 warp Server 4.
 
 So after examining in source code which module gives this kind of
 message, I found text in Perf-Tuning.html (Document provided with source
 code) about "USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT".  Some sentence speak about
 delay to start a new child about 1 second for 1 child.  
 10 [Emerg] messages come in less than 1 second.
 
 I changed Httpd.conf to grow some value :
 
 MinSpareServers 25 in stead of 1
 MaxSpareServers 50 "    "   "  5
 StartServers 50    "    "   "  5 (I'm not sure)
 
 Now it seems to run fine but some time get this message (less few than
 before).
 
 What do you think about this ?
 
 Regards and thanks for helping.
 
 
 
 Luc Your Cyber Friend.
