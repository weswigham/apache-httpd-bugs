>Description:
Just upgraded to 1.3.1 my domain resolves correctly to index.html located in htdocs however all calls to other files from there try to resolve to the first virtual host listed in httpd.conf.
ie. before: a call for images/image1.gif from index.html located in htdocs
worked fine.
after: a call for images/image1.gif from index.html located in htdocs tries to resolve to htdocs/spi/images
spi being a virtual host and also the first virtual host located in httpd.conf
I have "temporarily" fixed the problem by listing the primary domain in httpd.conf like a virtual host and putting it at the top of the list.
What I don't know is if this is a permanent fix and what changed from the previous version that it no longer works the same.
I would like to fix it correctly if this was not the proper method.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can't because I have it working but don't know if the fix was the correct method.

State-Changed-Why:
It is pretty hard for us to do anything if you don't tell us
what your configuration is.  Are you using IP or name based
virtual hosts?  Did you read the upgrading instructions and
add the appropriate NameVirtualHost setup?

If you can't tell us exactly what your virtual host config is
and give exact examples of requests, where you think they
should be going, and where they are going, we are unable
to do anything.

 Sorry, I'm using name-based virtual hosts
 If I call the primary domain for the server it resolves
 correctly to index.html located in htdocs however
 from index.html all links point to htdocs or
 htdocs/images but the server tries to resolve these links to
 htdocs/spi
 /spi obviously being a sub directory and also a virtual host.
 I hope this is the info you need and apologize for not  being
 more literate in this area. This is not my area of expetise.
 I'm inquiring because after encountering the problem and
 doing a little research on your web site in an attempt to
 better educate my self on this I am not sure that the company I
 purchase the virtual server from has implmented the correct
 resolve by adding the primary domain as a virtual host.
 I've inlcuded a copy of my hhtpd.conf file.
 Thank You for your time.

State-Changed-Why:
As I said, please go through the name based vhost documentation.

As I said, please pay attention to the NameVirtualHost directive.

If you have a problem with the services provided by the
company you hired, you should get them to help you out.
Otherwise, please follow the directions (eg. post to
Usenet) that are very clearly outlined before you submit
a bug report.

We can not personally assist millions of users who are
unable to go through the docs with basic configuration.

Thanks.

 I went through the documentation, I posted to the
 newsgroups and pursued as much info as I could
 gather from the company.
 Contacting you was a last ditch effort to try and understand
 what has happened.
 I apologize the info I require is too basic and am sorry
 that you find me a pest. I will not contact you again on this
 matter.
 Thanks,
 -Brian
