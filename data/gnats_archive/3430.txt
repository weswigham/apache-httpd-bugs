Enhancement-Request for MultiViews-Feature
------------------------------------------


 The situation (just to state the problem):

 - Having a complete webserver providing documents
   in several languages based on availibility and
   content/topics.

     - Document (MIME) types containing different language
       information may be (e.g.):
           .htm, .txt, .pdf, .doc, .xls, .gif


 - the selection of the language should be done by
   selection "preferred language" thru the browser.
   (Accept header information?)

 - The webserver selects the best matching document
   (language) for the selected MIME-Type. (as today)


 How should the documents be stored:
   
     test.htm            = doc in default language
     test.en.htm         = doc in english
     test.de.htm         = [etc.]
     ...
     test.pdf            = pdf doc in default language
     test.en.pdf         = [etc.]
     ...


 Requesting the document:

     http://...../test.htm   (returns best htm-match)
     http://...../test.pdf   (returns best pdf-match)
         

 Advantage:
     
   - No add. navigation to the multilanguage docs
     needed = easy to handle (e.g.: in an IntraNet docs
     mostly will be provided and maintained by
     "standard users" and not by webmasters)
    
     You just do the navigation between the default language
     documents.


 Why the enhancement request to the current MultiViews:
  
   - The current MultiViews handling is hard to understand & to
     handle by "standard users" (we are already trying to use
     MultiViews in our international IntraNet).

   - e.g. "test.htm.en" will not be correctly recognized by
     most programs (e.g. html editors).


 
 The Enhancement Request (Proposal):
 -----------------------------------

 1. Config-directive for standard language, handling
    the language for e.g. "test.htm".

      >> LanguageDefault       en          #  (test.htm = Lang. en)

    [Right now, apache sometimes return wrong (lang.) docs.]
    [see also: PR#1180]
 

 2. Telling Apache what MIME-types could have multilingual
    content (minimize impact on server = don't guess).
    
      >> LanguageTypes   .htm .html .shtml .gif .jpg .cgi .pl


 3. Don't change the mime-type (file extension) of the document:
    use "test.de.htm" instead "test.htm.de".

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the comments. Your main point is that you
would like a request for (say) doc.htm to negotiate
amongst files called doc.en.htm and doc.fr.htm. That
would involve a significant change from the current
behaviour, which will only negotiate amongst 
documents matching doc.htm.*. Your suggestion does make
sense, and would remove the artificial requirement that
extensions appear in a particular order (which is
not a requirement anywhere else in Apache). 

This is certainly something worth considering for
Apache 2.0. In the meantime I'll mark this PR as
"suspended" so that we do not forget about it.

For now, you could use the trick that you can repeat
extensions without altering how Apache deals with a file.
So you if called your files "doc.htm.en.htm" and 
"doc.htm.fr.htm" you can content negotiate on a request
for doc.htm and your editor would identify the file
as HTML.

 Hi!
 
 I've done some work on this #PR.
 I've made enhancements to mod_mime.c to define a DefaultLanguage.
 
    Syntax:   DefaultLanguage  <mime-language-type>
    The context is the same as AddLanguage.
 
    DefaultLanguage defines the MIME-language for all documents
    not covered by the AddLanguage directive.
 
 This should fix also the problem, that apache is returning a
 wrong language (doc), when more than one language is requested
 by the browser. This also should fix an old #PR1180.
 
 The following source stuff is only roughly tested...
 Please give a short feedback if there's any problem/question.

Language default properly provides the default language
of a file without a recognized language extension.

There is no impact on the server today, requests for a
specific file always serve that file.  You *must* depricate
the foo.html file and rename it foo.html.la for the other
languages to be selectable.  This is the correct behavior.

> 3. Don't change the mime-type (file extension) of the document:

You are asking for alternate orderings.  As a win32 user
myself, I sympathize.  You can name files foo.en.html today
with no ill effects, however they will not match foo.html.
That may change in Apache 2.0.
