State-Changed-Why:
We have nothing to do with the problem you are having.  We
create a piece of software that serves web pages.  If a 
site installs the software, and does not replace the 
default start-up page, you will recieve our default 
installation page.  There is nothing that we can do to
force people to remember to replace the default page with
their own content.
