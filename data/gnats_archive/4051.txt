>Description:
JServSession allocates a HashTable in it's constructor.

It would appear that the hashtable allocation could be delayed 
until the hashtable is required, thus saving ram + time in many
cases.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
trap 
if (sessionData == null) 

in several places and only allocate the hashtable if needed.
