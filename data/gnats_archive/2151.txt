>Description:
File README.configure gives how to enable most modules.
This example contains a typo, it uses the flag
--enable-modules instead of --enable-module.
configure gives no error message but the built apache 
does not contain the modules.
>How-To-Repeat:
File README.configure in the top level directory of the apache 1.3b6
distribution, line 157
>Fix:
Change enable-modules to enable-module
