>Environment:
SunOS tuvalu 5.5 Generic_103093-11 sun4m
>Description:
When making an HTTP/1.1 PUT, if the client sends
an Expect: 100 header, the server should answer
with a HTTP/1.1 100 Continue. However, Apache/1.3.3
doesn't do so.
>How-To-Repeat:
If your server is configured for a PUT,
telnet to it and try something like:

PUT /doc.html HTTP/1.1
Host: your_host_name
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 10
Expect: 100-Continue


In theory, you should get the 100-Continue there.
But in fact, the server doesn't send it and expects
you to send the resource itself there.


>Fix:
In http_protocol.c:917, the Expect: 100-Continue
header is well identified and a flag
(r->expecting_100)is setup.
However, this flag is reset by the time the 
thread reaches  http_protocol.c:1531, where it is used
to know if the 100 Continue should be sent.
The pointer r to the request_rec is not the same one
in 917 and 1531, so my guess is that the 
expecting_100 flag isn't being duplicated.

State-Changed-Why:

This is by design.  From the src/CHANGES file:

  *) Added a complete implementation of the Expect header field as
     specified in rev-05 of HTTP/1.1.  Disabled the 100 Continue
     response when we already know the final status, which is mighty
     useful for PUT responses that result in 302 or 401. [Roy Fielding]

Thanks for the report, and for using Apache.
