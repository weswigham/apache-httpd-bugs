>Description:
If I put in directory names (such as virtualhost documentroot's) that end with
backslash I am given the errror of passing in too many parameters.  If I leave
the directory with no slash at the end or a forward slash, it works
>How-To-Repeat:
as specified
>Fix:
possibly Mention this in the error report for invalid parameters, instead of 
saying that it takes one argument (that error message makes it seem as if you
are passing in too many arguments, but in reality you might just be passing in
bad ones).

 <VirtualHost _default_:*>
         DocumentRoot d:\Progra~1/apache~1/
 	ServerAdmin webmaster@none.com
         ServerName All_Other_Entries
 </VirtualHost>
 
 (documentroot is the directive in question)
 
 Notice how I can mix and match \'s and /'s and the above works.  When set
 to
         DocumentRoot d:\Progra~1/apache~1\
 
 it yields
 Syntax error on line 813 of d:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE/conf/httpd.conf:
 DocumentRoot takes one argument, Root directory of the document tree
 
 It also works fine with
          DocumentRoot d:\Progra~1/apache~1
 (no slash)
 
 If I put quotes (" ") around the directory name and have the backslash at
 the end then apache boots (no error), but when I access the web site it
 says
 
 Forbidden
 
 You don't have permission to access / on this server.
 
 Apache/1.3.4 Server at All_Other_Entries Port 80
  
 
 N.B. It says in httpd.conf that 
 # NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
 # instead of backslashes (e.g., "c:/apache" instead of "c:\apache").
 but it seems that you can use backslashes--just not at the end.

State-Changed-From-To: feedback-closed
State-Changed-By: pcs
State-Changed-When: Sat Jan 30 11:31:04 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug in Apache.

First, when giving directories in the configuration
file you should not end the directory with a slash
(in either direction). Apache adds the slash itself
when creating filenames from the configured directory names.

Second, as the instructions say, use forward slashes
as directory separators. Backslashes can have special
meanings. In this case, a backslash at the end of the
line means that the directive continues on the next
line. This is why you got an error. The error is
because the contents of the *next* line are being 
used as additional arguments to the current directive,
hence the error message. 

So, remove the trailing backslash, and convert the
backslashes into forward slashes.

 I recommend that httpd.conf be modified to read
 
 # NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
 # instead of backslashes (e.g., "c:/apache" instead of "c:\apache").
 # especially at the end of the directory.
 
 That will clear up some confusion with windows users.
 thanks for answering.
