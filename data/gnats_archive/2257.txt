AIX 4.1.5 and Solaris 2.5 and 2.6
>Description:
Suggestion: make apache use the host OS system passwd files for user
authentication. I wrote a little perl script that creates the userlist and
grouplist files for apache so I can use the OS system tools (smit and admintool)
to manage user accounts. Thanks! 
Great product! we have about 12 AIX/apache servers and 4 solaris servers
running...

State-Changed-Why:
This can be done now (with 1.3b*), but it is a very
very very bad idea.  Please see FAQ #23 at
<http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html>.

Thanks for your suggestion, though, and for using
Apache!
