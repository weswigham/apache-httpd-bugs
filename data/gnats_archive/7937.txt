>Environment:
Linux abubis 2.2.16-22 i686
>Description:
after un-commenting the server-status directive and loading
http://anubis/server-status, i noticed at the bottom of the
page there was a reference to turning ExtendedStatus on. i
read somewhere that in 2.0 ExtendedStatus was removed. i also
looked for it in httpd.conf (i did have to set it to ON in
my 1.3.x version) and it was indeed removed.
>How-To-Repeat:
load your server's server-status and see if the reference
appears at the bottom of the page.
>Fix:
remove the code that generates this line in the HTML page that
is returned.

State-Changed-Why:
The ExtendedStatus directive does still exist in Apache 
2.0.  I have just tested it, and it does work.  It was 
removed from early versions of Apache 2.0, but was added 
back before the first beta.  I will add the directive back 
to the default config file in the next few minutes.
