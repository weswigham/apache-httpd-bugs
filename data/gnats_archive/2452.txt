>Description:
===================
httpd processes are eating all CPU cycles and spirals down the server.
===================

e.g. 10(!) active httpd requests produce a high-level cpu usage (165% cpu usage
on a 3-cpu machine - shown by server-status).

We have 5 virtual servers up and running (3 web servers, 2 proxy servers).
There are no error log messages (nor apache logs, nor sys message entries, -
and hardware checks fine) concerning this problem.


We have tried out almost anything (changing Config,
playing with RLimitCPU, etc.).

Relevant parts of our apache Config FYI:

---------- snip ---------------
Timeout 300
KeepAlive On
MaxKeepAliveRequests 128
KeepAliveTimeout 15
MinSpareServers 4
MaxSpareServers 8
StartServers 5
MaxClients 150
MaxRequestsPerChild 128
#RLimitCPU 10 20

------------- snap ---------------

Any ideas to track down the problem? What can we do?

We have reported this problem ("server slow") also to Sun support.
The answer after some research by Sun was: httpd (apache) is the problem (sic)...

 Is your ServerRoot on NFS?  If so try using the LockFile directive.

 Hello!
 
 
 Sorry - No, the filesystem is on an internal harddisk (no remote mounts
 for webserver directories)...
 
 To keep it short, a list what I've tried or I'm still doing to track
 down the problem:
 
   - Checked all(?) hints on the apache bugdb & dejanews  (done)
   - Performance hints from the FAQ (done and still doing)
   - Checked the configs  (done some tune up)
 
   - Track down the problem using "truss" and  "lsof"  (still working on)
   - Tried to alter the apache code (insert debug code)
 
   no luck so far...
 
 
 We are using the apache for intranet servers and as virtual intranet
 (all servers are virtual)
   proxy1 = intranet proxy,  proxy2 = authentification proxy for internet
 firewall
 
 
 But as far as I can say at this moment, the problem seems to be located
 in the proxy functionality.
 Apache is fast in serving intranet pages (own pages).
 Requests for web pages via the proxies seems to be too slow (compared to
 a direct access to
 the firewall proxy).
 
 
 It seems to me very odd, that apache (10 active, 3 idle) can spiral down
 a Sparc 1000 (3 CPUs,
 512 MB, > 50 GB HD).
 
 At this moment we'll bind apache to only one cpu (pbind -cmd), so that
 the server will not be
 totally jammed - but this is no solution.
 
 
 I'm still trying to track down the problem, any ideas how it nailed
 down?
 
 
 Tnx for help! - Rainer

 Hi!
 
 First of all: please close this bug please - The problem seems to be
 fixed (Installing sun patch and rebooting).
 
 
 We have tried to track down the problem:
 
  The problem was mainly related to the use of the proxy functionality.
  Using a "simple" http service didn't show up such a high
  cpu usage (but it was to high, too).
 
  But the real problem "seemed" to be accessing the namesservice
  (gethostbyname, etc) (Problems with NIS, DNS?).
  But what is odd, only apache showed this performance problems.
 
 Sorry to bother the apache team - but it took us 1 week to get thing
 right again.
 
 Tnx for help -- Rainer
