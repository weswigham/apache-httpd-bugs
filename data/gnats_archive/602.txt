According to the 1.0 spec
(http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/rfc1945/rfc1945)
=====
   HTTP/1.0 servers must:

      o recognize the format of the Request-Line for HTTP/0.9 and
        HTTP/1.0 requests;

      o understand any valid request in the format of HTTP/0.9 or
        HTTP/1.0;

      o respond appropriately with a message in the same protocol
        version used by the client.
=====
in particular the last bullet point.
strangely enough the 1.1 draft spec
(http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/rfc2068/rfc2068)
doesn't have this section. Maybe the draft spec breaks the 1.0 spec.
Who knows?

BTW we picked this up because our service monitor expected the string 1.0
so I've got to go and fix that anyway :-)

Thanks,
James

>Fix:
Yes: Clarify the spec.
Make it always return the request version in the response regardless
of the spec.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a feature, not a bug.  There are numerous reasons
for it and it has been gone into in depth before.  There
are numerous other PRs in the database about the same thing.
A change of the minor version is defined as being backwords
compatable, so Apache is perfectly justified in doing what
it does.  See the force-response-1.0 variable at
http://www.apache.org/docs/env.html for a method of 
sending a HTTP/1.0 response to broken clients.
