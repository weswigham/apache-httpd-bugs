The output from uname -a is:
Linux cargo.araz.com 2.0.34 #1 Fri May 8 16:05:57 EDT 1998 i486 unknown

(this is a Redhat 5.1 pretty vanilla installation; apache was compiled using
these config parms (ie, cat config.status | tail -8)

./configure \
"--prefix=/usr/local/apache" \
"--verbose" \
"--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE" \
"--enable-module=all" \
"--enable-shared=max" \

>Description:
To the following summary I will prepend:
1.	I tried installing once with mod_perl and mod_php activated/loaded, 
	a second time without.
2.	I am an apache novice but have looked at faqs, posts and documentation in
	vain to solve this problem

Subj:  Apache 1.3.2 (DSO), Linux 2.0.34: Premature end of script
headers

All CGI scripts return the message:  Premature end of script headers
HTML scripts in the document root work fine.

This is a new apache installation, no prior version has been run on
this machine.
-----------------
Since this is a long post, here are my pleas up front!

1.      What else can a I try/set/unset?
2. If it seems as mysterious to you as I, where is another place 
        that I can turn to for help?  Is there a better newsgroup or maybe
        an apache-specific forum?
3.      Is there a way for me to get different or more intensive logging
        that could help resolve the cause of these scripts' failure?
-----------------

*********************************
I'm trying to figure out if this is my configuration or if there's an
apache bug here, so I've included detail on the troubleshooting I've
done.  I am an apache novice, please forgive me if I miss something
obvious.  I have read lots of posts on 'Premature end of script
headers' and only one seems to correspond to my present conundrum, and
that person has no solution yet.

*********************************
All CGI scripts are in the standard location for 1.3.2:
/usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin.  Permissions are owner, group and 
world-readable and -executable for every directory in 
the path and every  file in the cgi-bin directory (except the file
named '403forbidden', for obvious reasons).

*********************************
Apache configuration options that I have checked and/or changed:

A. srm.conf

DocumentRoot /pub/intranet/htdocs
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin/
AddHandler cgi-script pl
AddHandler cgi-script .pl

B.      access.conf

<Directory />
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

<Directory /pub/intranet/htdocs>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
</Directory>

<Directory /usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin>
AllowOverride None
Options         +ExecCGI
</Directory>

ScriptLog /usr/local/apache/var/log/script_log

C. httpd.conf

User nobody
LogLevel notice

D. There are no .htaccess files on the system.

*********************************
I run perl 5.00404, standard out of the box with Redhat 5.1.  It is
found in /usr/bin/perl (verified using which).

*********************************
Following are details on some specific scripts that fail.

All scripts used for testing are *unaltered* scripts that come from
apache (test-cgi, printenv) or Lincoln Stein (plaintext3.pl).
(Permissions may have been changed to ensure that scripts are 
readable and executable by owner, group and world.)
Inspect the example(s) at bottom for script details.

All scripts run without error from the command line, viz:
./test-cgi
./printenv
./plaintext3.pl
(This holds true even when run as user 'nobody', which according to
httpd.conf is how apache executes these scripts)

All of them produce as their first line either 
'Content-type: text/html' or 'Content-type: text/plain'.  In each
case, the next line is blank.  

This may be a permissions problem of some sort, but it's not obvious
to me.  I can reproduce the '404 Not found' and '403 Forbidden' server
error messages by linking to a nonexistent file and a file without
world-read or -execute permission, respectively.  The latter yields
the following message from the server (as displayed in the lynx
browser I use for these tests):

403 Forbidden
...
file permissions deny server execution:
/usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin/403forbidden

 As always, you should use the latest version when you can't make something
 work.

 Are you _sure_ you are running the right copy of the binary and it is
 compiled without mod_perl?  Unpack a completely new tree and try just
 running "configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache" without enable-shared=max
 or SHARED_CORE.

 Then that is a configuration issue with mod_perl and needs to be 
 addressed there, not here.
