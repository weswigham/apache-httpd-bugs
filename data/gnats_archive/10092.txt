>Description:
In the page/chapter on "Content Negotiation" in the official Apache
documentation, there are some parts which I feel could be made somewhat
clearer, therefore I'm proposing a few small changes/additions.


******************************************************************


In the section "Apache Negotiation Algorithm", there is currently (last
point):

   4. To get here means no variant was selected (because none are
   acceptable to the browser). Return a 406 status (meaning "No acceptable
   representation") with a response body consisting of an HTML document
   listing the available variants. Also set the HTTP Vary header to indicate
   the dimensions of variance.

I believe this should be extended a bit, so I propose the following:

   4. To get here means no variant was selected (because none are
   acceptable to the browser). Return a 406 status (meaning "No acceptable
   representation") with a response body consisting of an HTML document
   listing the available variants. Also set the HTTP Vary header to indicate
   the dimensions of variance.

   Remark: You should be aware that the error message returned by Apache is
   neccessarily rather terse and might confuse some users (even though it
   lists the available alternatives). If you want to avoid users seeing this
   error page, you should organize your documents such that a document in a
   default language (or with a default encoding etc.) is always returned if a
   document is not available in any of the languages, encodings etc. the
   browser asked for.

   In particular, if you want a document in a default language to be returned
   if a document is not available in any of the languages a browser asked
   for, you should create a document with no language attribute set.  See
   "Variants with no Language" below for details.


*******************************************************************
In the section "Variants with no Language" it says:

   If some of the variants for a particular resource have a language
   attribute, and some do not, those variants with no language are given a
   very low language quality factor of 0.001.

   The reason for setting this language quality factor for variant with no
   language to a very low value is to allow for a default variant which can
   be supplied if none of the other variants match the browser's language
   preferences. For example, consider the situation with three variants:

       * foo.en.html, language en
       * foo.fr.html, language en
       * foo.html, no language

   The meaning of a variant with no language is that it is always acceptable
   to the browser. If the request Accept-Language header includes either en
   or fr (or both) one of foo.en.html or foo.fr.html will be returned. If the
   browser does not list either en or fr as acceptable, foo.html will be
   returned instead.

The text does not mention how this scheme must be implemented
when using MultiViews or a type-map file, so it is a bit confusing
(particularly as using e.g. foo.html.en , foo.html.fr and foo.html
will not work when the page is accessed as foo.html).
Proposed new version for the text above:

   If some of the variants for a particular resource have a language
   attribute, and some do not, those variants with no language are given a
   very low language quality factor of 0.001.

   The reason for setting this language quality factor for variant with no
   language to a very low value is to allow for a default variant which can
   be supplied if none of the other variants match the browser's language
   preferences. This allows you to avoid users seeing a "406" error page
   if their browser is set to only accept languages which you do not offer
   for the ressource that was requested.

   For example, if you use MultiViews, you can create three files:

       foo.en.html
       foo.fr.html
       foo.html

   The meaning of a variant with no language is that it is always acceptable
   to the browser. So if a browser requests foo , the following will
   happen: If the request's Accept-Language header includes either en
   or fr (or both) one of foo.en.html or foo.fr.html will be returned. If the
   browser does not list either en or fr in the Accept-Language header
   sent, foo.html will be returned instead. Warning: If foo.html is accessed
   (and not foo), content negotiation will not take place (as an exact match
   takes precedence), instead the contents of foo.html will always be
   returned.  Therefore, if you use names of the form foot.html.en ,
   foo.html.fr etc.  and link to those files as foo.html (as is customary on
   many sites), then the default file needs to be named foo.html.html .

 Thank you for your quick work. One more thing: I noticed you only included
 my additions in the 1.3 version of the documentation. The 2.0 version of
 the docs, which appears to be in a different CVS directory (namely here:
 http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-docs-2.0/manual/content-negotiation.html ),
 contains an almost identical document on Content negotiation, so maybe
 it would make sense to include my additions there as well?
 
 Keep up the good work!
 
 Greetings,
 
 Sebastian Leske

 Yes, but what you wrote is not the correct solution for 2.0.  There is a 
 new ForceLanguagePriority directive that makes things easier.  That 
 certainly needs to be better documented, but I wasn't up to that when I 
 fixed your bug.
 
 Thanks again.
 
 Joshua.
