When I click on the filename, MSIE4.01 open the Window for download, but it seems not receiving the size, or ... to open the download.

I experienced the same problem downloading the code of apache from apache.org 
I had to use the ftp section to get the code

That's odd because we've got a lot of MSIE users who have no
trouble using the site... are you sure you don't have a proxy
or something in between you and the apache server?

 I found a solution to this problem at the end of last week:
 
 I suppress the compressing of Z and gz in the conf file, because the 
 problem only happens with MSIE (not Netscape) with file of extension of 
 .Z and .gz
 Now, it's working without this option for my web site, but not yours.
 
 I hope this could help you.

State-Changed-Why:
I've just heard this elsewhere.  Apparently microsoft in their
hugely infinite wisdom has used the .gz file extension for
something other than gzip -- they're using it for some vbasic
thing.  And because of that MSIE has problems dealing with anything
that has a .gz file extension.

I'm sorry, but I'm inclined to say:  tough luck, the .gz file
extension has been in use for 5 years now.  Microsoft needs to
wake up and fix their broken code.

But since I don't use MSIE, and heck I don't even use windows,
I can't verify this.  You can probably verify it by trying to
fetch a URL such as:

http://www.apache.org/dist/apache_1.3b5.tar

If that works, but adding the .gz on the end doesn't then it's
microsoft's problem.  Please report back what you find, thanks.

 OK, This is working....

 But why this happens to .gz *AND* .Z ?
 If I uncomment the following lines (what I did) in the srm.conf it works:
 #AddEncoding x-compress Z
 #AddEncoding x-gzip gz
 
 (mime.types file is as distributed by apache package)
 
 Could you tell me if this is a mis-interpretation from MSIE or a 
 mis-sending type from Apache Web server?
 
 If you think it's Microsoft (send me an e-mail to confirm), I will register 
 this bug, but keep a track of this fro the community.
 
 Thanks,

yeah well dean is unlikely to answer this as he thinks
it's a browser bug, and it's unlikely to be a server bug,
and dean doesn't use windows so there's no way he could
reproduce it to even debug it.

Definitely an MSIE bug.
