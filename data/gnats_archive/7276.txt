>Description:
I encountered the problem that my client doesn't get
all data that is sent to him by a server from the proxy.

At the end of my message I include a slightly edited logfile
generated by a tcp/ip sniffer:

As we can see, the POST request is successfully delivered
from the client to the proxy and from there to the server.

The proxy machine gets a positive answer back from the
server and even acknowledges it (at 01:01:51.7).

But the proxy doesn't deliver this to the client machine.
Instead it closes the connection to the client after 5 minutes
(at 01:06:53.2).

In Apache's access log file I see something like this:

POST http://194.174.193.20:9001/webforms 200 0

which says - as far as I know - "no data received from the
remote side".

The same problem exists with Apache 1.3.17.
