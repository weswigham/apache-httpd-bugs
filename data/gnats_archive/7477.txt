MacOS X 
>Description:
I am running Apache on a MacOS X server, the webpages work fine through a Mac browser and I can FTP from a Mac into the server to upload things.  However through a PC, I can't do either of these things.  The web page doesn't show up, nor can I connect through FTP.  The PC can ping the server with no problem.  

Please help.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
