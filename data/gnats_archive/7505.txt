Windows 2000 server, Oracle 8i enterprise, Oracle 9ias (includes Apache)
>Description:
When we copy a new jar file to the proper folder in the Oracle 9ias, and then try to access the webpage that references the jar files, we get an error message that says "java.security.accesscontrolexception.access denied (java.net.socketpermission domain Or machine name resolve). Someone told us that apache is caching the name of the machine that compiled the code and is trying to look there for the jar files. Can you help????

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr  3 11:46:06 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
If you are using oracle's products, you really have to talk to them for support.  Also, this is a bugs database not a support forum.

I'm afraid there isn't anything we can do to help.

 If the apache listener is caching server names somewhere, it would be
 nice to know how to disable or clear it. This is an apache web server,
 even though it was supplied by Oracle.
