>Description:
I'm developing a module, which generates its output on the fly, so, under
HTTP/1.1, Apache sends the entity-body with Transfer-Encoding: chunked.  The
first chunk-size is sometimes followed by a space, which is a violation of the
RFC.
>How-To-Repeat:
Mmm, I'm afraid I can't give you the code to the module.  If the problems's
nonobvious, I might be able to come up with a small test case.  I'm not sure,
though, since I don't know why it doesn't always happen.  I was hoping it would
be something obvious, like somebody didn't quite read the spec right and stuck
in a padding space.

State-Changed-Why:

It is possible that the "implied *LWS" rule at the end of
section 2.1 of draft 06 of the HTTP/1.1 document applies
in this case.  Investigating..
