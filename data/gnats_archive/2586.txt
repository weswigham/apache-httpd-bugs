>Environment:
Linux 2.0.13 (Redhat v5.0)
apache 1.2.4 and 1.3

>Description:
Although links to .mid or .wav files on Apache servers work, you cannot <embed> 
midi,wav or any other inline plugin when viewing from Communicator 4.05 even after 
you put the "AddType audio/x-wav .wav" or "AddType audio/x-mid .mid, .midi" into
the srm.conf. 

The same html page with embeds will work if served from other non-apache servers..

This cannot be a netscape bug as previously stated in your bugs database because 
I can load pages (w/embeds) directly from the harddisk using the File/Open page
in NS4.05 and it will work fine.  Going through the server (on the same machine)
is what causes it to fail. (I have the server and NS4.05 on the same machine)
>How-To-Repeat:
see http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/docs/testmidi.html (for a server that works)

BTW - Yes, I am using the xswallow helper plugin to allow embeds to work.  Click
"return" on the previous page to read about this plugin and why it is necessary
for Netscape on Linux. (basically it allows inline X and non-X apps to act as
inline plugins for Netscape)

Copy this html page into your own configured test server running Apache 1.3 and it
will fail. 
>Fix:
Well, I suppose I could never use embed but that would limit the functionality
of any decent page that needs backgrounding of plugins.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache doesn't know or care or need to know or care anything
about embed and it is almost impossible for this to be an
Apache bug without it impacting other things.

The fact that navigator can load them directly from disk
is irrelevant and has nothing to do with the issue; it is
almost certainly a misconfiguration of Apache.

Please check the docs for the syntax of AddType; commas are not treated
as extension seperators.

Please give the URL of a page on your server that doesn't work
for you; it is almost certain that your MIME types aren't
configured correctly so the proper MIME type isn't being returned.
