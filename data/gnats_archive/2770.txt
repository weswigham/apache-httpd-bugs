>Description:
I'm running Apache as proxy on a firewall blocking connections between unknown ports. FTP transfer to eg. ftp.microsoft.com will establish a PASV connection between two unknown ports if firewalling is disabled, but fail otherwise. I commented out the PASV section in proxy_ftp.c (line 770 "try to setup PASV first" to line 846 "try the regular way") with some success (ftp.netscape.com would work, the data connection was proxy:unknown to ftp.nescape.com:21 as expected). With ftp.microsoft.com, a connection between proxy:21 and ftp.microsoft.com:21 was established, but the browser will simply time out. No error_log entry.
>How-To-Repeat:
access (any) ftp-server when only connections from/to well-known ports (20, 21) are allowed.
>Fix:
Configuration option: use well-known ports only; try regular mode first, then PASV

 The problem has in fact two parts:
 - PASV connection is tried first, but the proxy won't allow unknown ports on
 both sides. As a workaround, I commented out the PASV code in proxy_ftp.c
 (#define TRY_PASV_FIRST 0)
 - no PORT command is issued. I added the following code to 1.3.3:

   /* try to set up PASV data connection first */
       dsock = ap_psocket(p, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
       if (dsock == -1) {

   	}
   	listen(dsock, 2);	/* only need a short queue */
