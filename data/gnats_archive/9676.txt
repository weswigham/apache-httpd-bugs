>Description:
Apache 2 does at least one read() system call for every byte that it reads from a CGI program.  Ouch!  It seems that the stream is unbuffered and apr_file_gets() calls apr_file_read() once per byte; including timeouts, it can be more than one read() per byte!
>How-To-Repeat:
Add some diagnostics to srclib/apr/file_io/unix/readwrite.c or do a system call trace when running a simple CGI program (e.g., printenv).
>Fix:
Perhaps there's some confusion between nonblocking and unbuffered.  Although the CGI pipe may have to be nonblocking, is there any reason that apr_file_read() shouldn't read ahead and buffer as much as it can get (up to some arbitrary limit), even when it's only being asked for 1 byte at a time?
