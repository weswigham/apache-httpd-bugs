>Description:
Maybe not a true but but more of an implementation suggestion. The caching
protocol seems to check the cache size only on the specified interval. If you
have a large cache and many users, this cache can grow very rapidly before
apache even checks its size. Conversely, if you check the size too often and
you have a very large cache (100MB+) then it takes too long to check the
size. This combination makes it difficult to have a large cache for a proxy
for a large corporation.	
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Perhaps having the cache keep a running total of size and expire more often
without the need to completely search the file system. Seems like CERN did
something like this

State-Changed-Why:
It's important to remember that the Apache cache expires
*down* to the specified size. Careful tuning of the proxy
directives has yielded good results on sites with caches
up to 500 Mb so far. That said, one of our goals for the
releases after 1.2 (probably 2.0) is to redo the cache
mechanism in a more efficient and intuitive manner.

Currently working with user on tuning the cache.
He may end up going to squid.

No further reply from user. If necessary, I can work
offline with him on proxy tuning.
