Sorry, I don't have time to get into more detail on this right now, but I wanted to quickly bring this up so if anyone has time to look into this it might help the next people who come along.

The documentation for the jserv install makes it appear that one can go to http://hostname/servlets/Hello to test the install, without fist configuring all of the properties files. The zone properties file, which has the essential location configuration of the servlets directory isn't very clear. It isn't clear that one needs to copy the Hello example file into this directory to get the example program to work. Additionally, I don't see any reason not to start people off with /usr/local/apache/logs/logfilename as the default, since we already know apache has permission to write there, and we can suspect there isn't already a jserv log that's going to appear there. Having NONE/logs as the default only confuses matters. So that I could get to see my log files before I knew what was going on, I actually created a NONE directory!

The documentation in the INSTALL is so clear right up until the end. If someone were to just take a little longer to streamline this last bit, lots of time would be saved for us "end users" out here.

Further comment: the documentation that appears after doing a configure, make and make install of jserv says to go back to apache and do a "make and a make install" of apache actually should say that one needs to go back and do a "configure --with.jserv.module" and then do the makes and make installs. Because of the information the user has given at this point, you know where the user is in their progress, and what they need to do or not do.
