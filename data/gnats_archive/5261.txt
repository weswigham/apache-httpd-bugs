>Environment:
reproducible on Solaris 2.7 and SGI 6.5, OS independant (problem in the
the JServ java servlet engine).

>Description:


JServ1.1b3, java JServ rejects connections that do not originate from
localhost, whatever the value of the security.allowedAddresses property.

This is serious/critical: It prevents from using JServ1.1b3 
with JServ engines on different hosts than the web server.

>How-To-Repeat:
Configure JServ so that 
security.allowedAddresses=127.0.0.1,x.y.z.X (x.y.z.X is the
IP of the same machine, network interface).

Then, with telnet, try the connection:

telnet localhost 8007
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
ò]çKÛH[¢W
Connection closed by foreign host.




telnet x.y.z.X 8007
Trying x.y.z.X...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

On the Contrary, changing nothing to the configuration but
replacing the ApacheJServ1.1b3 jar by the 1.0 version gives:
 telnet localhost 8007
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
ÛH]
Í
Connection closed by foreign host.
telnet x.y.z.X 8007
Trying x.y.z.X...
Connected to gprotein.physbio.mssm.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
Q¶>ÛH]âí
Connection closed by foreign host.

>Fix:
I will reinstall JServ1.0. I did not look into the code differences
between 1.0 and 1.1b3.
