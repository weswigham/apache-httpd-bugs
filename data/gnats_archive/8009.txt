HOWEVER, we aren't getting a core. I tried setting CoreDumpDirectory to /tmp, no luck.
I created "httpd.core" in SERVERROOT with 777 permissions, no dump.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Jul 11 09:38:12 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Your OS is probably not allowing a process that has setuid()
to dump core for security reasons.  You either need to setup apache so it is started by the user it runs as, or change your OS so it allows such core dumps, if possible.
