>Description:
I made an upgrade from 1.2.6 to 1.3.4 and
followed the FAQ E.11 instructions to modify
my config using NameVirtualHost and <VirtualHost IP>.

All of the vituals and main hosts map to the first virtual.

The bug report #463 suggest to change the type of my_addr
to a 32-bit type in http_config.c.
I only found my_addr in src/main/http_vhost.c and
src/main/util.c, and i successively
passed my_addr from unsigned long my_addr to
unsigned my_addr and to unsigned int my_addr.

I tried this unsuccessfully whith 1.3.4 and 1.3.1.

Thanks for any help.

>How-To-Repeat:
Actually under 1.2.6 :
http://www-ulp.u-strasbg.fr/ is the main
the virtuals are
http://www-pole.u-strasbg.fr/
http://www-docalsa.u-strasbg.fr/
http://www-sfdp.u-strasbg.fr/
http://www-eadph.u-strasbg.fr/

Actually under 1.3.4 :
http://currif.u-strasbg.fr:90/ should be the main
http://www-currif.u-strasbg.fr:90/ is the first virtual
to which maps http://currif.u-strasbg.fr:90/
