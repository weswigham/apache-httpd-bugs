>Description:
medc79# patch < mod_servlet_c.patch
Hmm...  Looks like a context diff to me...
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|*** mod_servlet.c.orig Fri Jun  6 01:56:13 1997
|--- mod_servlet.c      Wed Jun 11 23:51:52 1997
--------------------------
Patching file mod_servlet.c using Plan A...
(Fascinating--this is really a new-style context diff but without
the telltale extra asterisks on the *** line that usually indicate
the new style...)
Hunk #1 failed at 62.
Hunk #2 failed at 88.
Hunk #3 failed at 500.
Hunk #4 failed at 548.
Hunk #5 failed at 562.
Hunk #6 failed at 611.
Hunk #7 failed at 628.
Hunk #8 failed at 647.
Hunk #9 failed at 699.
9 out of 9 hunks failed--saving rejects to mod_servlet.c.rej
Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.
done

Erm... I'm not sure what you expect us to do about it.
I'm not sure exactly what mod_servlet_c.patch you are talking
about or where you got it from, but it is on the Apache web site.
It may be that the patch is for an older version of
mod_servlet.  You need to talk to whoever made the patch.

In any case, I would recommend considering other more efficient
options instead of mod_servelet.  See http://java.apache.org/
for details.
