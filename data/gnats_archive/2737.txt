>Description:
There are wrong charecters in http_protocol.c - lines 1247 - 1278
                          and buff.c            line  1092

Example: buff.c~ is original, buff.c is correct

apache_1.3.1/src/main# diff buff.c buff.c~
1092c1092
<       return write_with_errors(fb, buf, nbyte);
---
>       return write_wh_erro(fb, b, nbyt;

Gzipped tar was downloaded from www.apache.org, 1.3b7 from sunsite.mff.cuni.cz.
Lines in files from 1.3b7 are good and can be copied to files from 1.3.1 and
compilation is ok.
>How-To-Repeat:
Trying to compile. I really followed intructions in INSTALL.
>Fix:
Copy good lines from files distributed in 1.3b7

I have no idea why you filed this in the os-windows
category...

In any case, the tarball is fine on the server.  Your download
must have been corrupted somewhere along the way.

 You are right. I just tried to download it from www.apache.org and
 sunsite.mff.cuni.cz, gunziped and untared them. Both *.c files were ok.
