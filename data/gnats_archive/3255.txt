>Environment:
Windows NT4 SP3 US, Apache 1.3.3 precompiled binary from www.apache.org
>Description:
When 'apache -k shutdown' is issued in the first few seconds after apache
is started the event required for the new functionality does not yet exist
(see below).

================================================================================
C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache>start apache

C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache>apache -k shutdown
[Tue Oct 20 21:39:23 1998] [emerg] (2)The system cannot find the file specified:
 OpenEvent on ap457_shutdown event
================================================================================

This is a problem if this command is used by other applications to stop apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start apache, then issue in the first few seconds after start an
'apache -k shutdown' command.
>Fix:
Create the event(s) at once when apache.exe is started even if you are not
yet ready to process them.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: kparz@raleigh.ibm.com
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 27 04:38:47 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Actually, the event semaphore wasn't created too late, it
was destroyed too early!  Apache was closing the event,
then waiting for the children to die.  The CloseHandle was
moved after the loop where we wait for the children
to die.
This fix has been committed to CVS.

Thanks for using Apache!
