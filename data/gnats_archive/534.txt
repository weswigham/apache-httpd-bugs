State-Changed-Why:
Yes, mod_proxy does convert it.  Some browsers convert it
too.  This behavior is entirely legal.  The server
at mars1.rz.uni-regensburg.de (claims to be a
Novell-HTTP-Server/2.51R1) is horribly broken by not
understanding % encoded URLs.  Whoever is responsible
for that server should whine loudly to the vendor
because it is really horribly broken.  Version 3.1
may (or may not...) fix the problem.

The behavior has nothing to do with the '.'.

State-Changed-Why:

A small correction.  Modifying the URL is illegal for an
HTTP/1.1 proxy and is one of the known bugs that will have
to be fixed before mod_proxy can use HTTP/1.1 (it is currently
only making HTTP/1.0 requests/responses).

The Novell server is just being stupid, not broken.
