>Environment:
SunOS triumph 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
When the partition that the access_log is writing to fills up,
httpds spawn up to MaxClients and stop responding to requests.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start apache; fill the log partition; continue to bombard the
server with traffic.  Works with Keepalive on or off.
>Fix:
Get a big disk for your log partition?  :)  Seriously, I'd rather
lose logs than deny traffic, so it would be great if the log module
could faile gracefully and allow the server to continue to serve
requests

State-Changed-Why:
Apache does not do anything that should cause it to
stop in the manner you suggest when the disk is full.

Please see PR#1376 for some possible things that may cause
it and some things to try to see where it is happening.

If it can ever be reproduced and tracked to something in Apache,

 You're correct; I can't reproduce it now -- when I could reproduce
 it, the access_log was 970mb and the disk was full.  I filled the
 disk again with some other garbage files, but the server did not hang
 even though the new access log couldn't be written to.  Perhaps it's
 a problem with some combination of very large files, Solaris & apache.
 
 If I have a chance to reproduce I'll let you know.  Thanks for the
 pointer.  Case closed.
 
 Eric
