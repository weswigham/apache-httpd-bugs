>Environment:
linux 1.2.13 through 2.0.33 i386
not compiler or lib related
>Description:
server running linux 1.2.13 apache 1.2.4
AuthUserFile docs say:
Filename is the path to the user file. If it is not absolute 
it is treated as relative to the ServerRoot.

So in ".htaccess" containing AuthFileName <relative path to>
If ServerRoot is specified as:
ServerRoot  /usr/local/etc/httpd
then only directories specified as ./httpd/foo1/foo2/foo3
may be used to specify the location of the UserAccessFile

Specifying ./foo1/UserAccessFile does not work when the file is in
/usr/local/etc/httpd/foo1
it must be specified as ./httpd/foo1/UserFile

This would seem to violate the statement from the documentation

in addition:

if UserAccessFile is placed in all directories from
/usr/local/etc  down thru 
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/foo1/foo2/....etc

specifying AuthUserFile UserAccessFile 
or AuthUserFile ./UserAccessFile
or AuthUserFile ./foo1/UserAccessFile "never works"
>How-To-Repeat:
See above and another example, different server running i386 linux 2.0.33

.htaccess in user directory /home/foouser/public_html/foo1
placing the UserAccessFile in /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf
AuthUserFile ./httpd/conf/UserAccessFile "works"
AuthUserFile ./conf/UserAccessFile "does not work"
--------------------
placeing the file in the ServerRoot (/usr/local/etc/httpd)
AuthUserFile ./httpd/UserAccessFile "works"
AuthUserFile UserAccessFile "does not work"
>Fix:
Sorry, I am not a C programmer
I keep thinking I've missed something here but I've tested and it repeats
on different machines, different versions of apache and Linux
