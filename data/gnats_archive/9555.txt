>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Tried both Windows 2000 Professional SP2 and Windows XP
>Description:
I have taken my scripts and database that runs on my Linux machine and copy it to where I have Apache installed (not the database it was successfully imported into MySQL 3.23.47). When I try to login on the startpage I get an error from apache.exe. Problem is that I can't see any information on this problem. This works perfect on my RH 7.2 machine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Need to have your ip so that I can open up my firewall in that case. When I got it i can open up for you. Othervise the link is http://jacs.prolandia.com:8080/pdm/index.html user is anders with password anders.
