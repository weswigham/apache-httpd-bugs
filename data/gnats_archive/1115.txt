Thanks for help.

State-Changed-Why:
Using Perl scripts with Apache under Windows is not quite the same as other
Windows web servers. First, you need to make sure that Apache will execute
the scripts, either by putting them into a ScriptAlias directory, or giving
them a file extension you've associated with the cgi-script handler using
AddHandler.

You also need to add the following Unix-style line to the top of your Perl
scripts:

#!c:\perl\bin\perl.exe

(or whatever the path to your Perl binary is)

If this is set up correctly, Apache should correctly set up and execute
your Perl scripts.

Apache 1.3a1 does not work with the PerlIS.dll ISAPI module; 1.3b1 should
work better, and should be available shortly.
