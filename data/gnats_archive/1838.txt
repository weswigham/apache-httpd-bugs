>Environment:
OS: Linux 2.0.30
Platform: Pentium II 300 MHz, 128 MB RAM, 150 MB swap space, 2 GB HDD
Compiler: gcc version 2.8.0
>Description:
we enabled caching on our web proxy using the following settings:

CacheRoot /usr/local/www/cache
CacheSize 50000
CacheGcInterval 24
CacheMaxExpire 200
CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
CacheDirLevels 20
CacheDefaultExpire 200
NoCache .dtas.net

when a proxy request is made, the proxy process stays in state "W" (indicated
by /status), and the load grows up to 60 and above. the machine is vitually
dead, and is aggressively accessing the hard disk.

when the caching is disabled, the load never exceeds 0.2!
>How-To-Repeat:
unfortunately, this server is in our corporate intranet, so it is not visible from
the internet. but i am happy to send any required information, like the
configuration files or the compiled binary.
>Fix:
disabling caching works well for us as a temporary fix

State-Changed-Why:

You defined CacheDirLevels to be 20 (the default is 3)...
Well, the default value for CacheDirLength is 1
and Apache tries to build his cache directory on the
first request after caching is enabled.
When you read the proxy documenation you will notice
that using 20 for CacheDirLevels and 1 for CacheDirLength
will give you the increadible number of 2^120
subdirectories.
On 99.99% of all Apache proxies out there it is not
needed to tune CacheDirLevels or CacheDirLength and
it shouldn't be done unless you know what you are doing.

The result of CacheDirLevels * CacheDirLength must be
less or equal than 20 otherwise Apache will issue an
error message.
