>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1/Sun OS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-27 sun4m, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
Log config token %m is in the docs, and there's even a report for 1.3
where someone discusses using it, and shows code (presumably from an
earlier 1.3) that has it.  But mod_log_config.c distributed with 1.3.9
(downloaded Dec  3 15:47) definitely does NOT have it in there.
>How-To-Repeat:
View mod_log_config.c.
>Fix:
Here's my patch.  It's all of 9 lines of code (of course, I'm
pasting it into the window, so any tabs are now spaces):
