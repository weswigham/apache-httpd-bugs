I installed the Apache Server 1.3.3 from the Red Hat Linux 5.2.
>Description:
I installed the Apache Server 1.3.3 from the Red Hat Linux 5.2 for a period of time.
It works fine. I enable its basic security feature, all the user must login with his username and password.
It works in Netscape 3.0 ~ 4.5, IE 3.0 ~ 4.0 (Client Browser version number).
But recently I found that the IE5.0 will not pop up the authentication box for querying the user's username and password.
Instead, it directly display the "Authentication Required ....." message in the browser.
I don't know whether it's a bug or my configuration error. Because it works in the past time on current browser.
It only can't support the IE5.0. So I send this mail to you. Also, I need the answer, too. Thanks.
By the way, if I just use the URL (ex. 192.168.0.99), this problem will appear,
 but if I use the full path (ex. 192.168.0.99/index.html), it will appear the authentication pop up box.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, because its a local LAN, I only public to our local user.
 It contains an illegal IP address in the internet. So you don't have the change to access my server.
But I think it's easy to reproduce in all Apache Servers.
>Fix:
Add some lines in httpd.conf or srm.conf file.
