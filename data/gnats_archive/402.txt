SunOS atom 5.4 Generic_101945-41 sun4m sparc
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.4/2.6.3/specs
gcc version 2.6.3
>Description:
After editing src/Configuration (no chanegs) and running ./Configure
apache wouldn't compile. It stopped with:

gcc -c -Iregex  -O2 -DSOLARIS2   http_main.c
http_main.c:159: parse error before `jmpbuffer'
http_main.c:159: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
http_main.c:160: parse error before `restart_buffer'
http_main.c:160: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `http_main.o'

>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know why this problem occurs in the first place. I fixed
it the simple way, but it makes no sense. See "way to fix".
>Fix:
What I did:
I included the definition
typedef int sigjmp_buf[_SIGJBLEN];
  (which I took from /usr/include/setjmp.h) into http_main.c
at line 157.
It makes no sense since setjmp.h IS ALREADY included into http_main.c
(see line 88) but it worked. I'd be happy to hear from you if you
know why this happened.%0

State-Changed-Why:
This could easily be a headerfile mismatch between gcc's
header files and the system header files.  You should try
upgrading gcc and/or using the sun compiler (if you have it).
Or try running fixincludes again (part of the gcc installation
procedure).

Take a look in /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.4/2.6.3
for gcc's headers and see if they match up with what you're
seeing in /usr/include.
