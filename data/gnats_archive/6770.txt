 Hello!
 
 I have noticed that apache1.3.14 as built from the port collection on a 
 FreeBSD 3.5.1-RELEASE box  has the following [mis]behavior:
 
 When a .pdf file is requested, first just a small part of it is transferred
 The log file shows two records 
 (both with a code of "206" and the amount of transferred bytes
 smaller then the full size):
 remote.host - - [31/Oct/2000:11:40:24 -0500] "GET /~user/cv.pdf HTTP/1.0" 206 12445
 remote.host- - [31/Oct/2000:11:40:28 -0500] "GET /~user/cv.pdf HTTP/1.0" 206 1121
 
 Netscape communicator (with an Acrobat plugin)
 (4.75, an other 4.7x versions on winNT, MacOS-9,
 and Irix) is used in all tests.
 At times, on NT and on Mac the Netscape client was hanging completely.
 
 When it is loading the file, first it is showing : xx% of FF kB,
 where FF is the full file size, then it disappears, and
 xx% of NN kB flashes,
 where NN kB is the size that is smaller than the full file size,
 and corresponds to the files logged in the access.log as mentioned above.
 
 On the second request the file is usually served just alright.
 I found that the same problems were reported to APACHE project
 with the same problem while using MSIE.
 (http://search.apache.org/) Reports #: 6711, 6715 6761, 6766)
 
 After downgrading to 1.3.12 I found that there are no more problems
 with this.
 The Netscape shows similar indicator numbers as before,
 and the log shows partial transfers (which I think correspond
 to a partial pages, because the second set of message appeared after I
 scrolled the pages in the document.

Could you please supply details on exactly what headers

of Apache differs between the two version.  You may
need to use a network sniffer to take this off the wire.
Thanks!

I'm closing this report because it is a duplicate of #6711.
I have been unable to reproduce the problem, so if you can
add to PR#6711 an example URL that exhibits it, and a URL
to the packet traces that Joshua Slive asked for that would
be great. Thanks.

 I have been able to reproduce it now, but I have so far been unable to
 work out what causes it. The slow requests look fast from the web
 server end so I guess we are tickling a bug in the Acrobat plugin.

 That's quite possible.
 I think, however I think I just found a bit, or to be more exact a byte 
 that might be responsible for the misbehavior.
 
 Note, that the previous version (.12) of the server handles it just fine.
 I do not know what is the exact mechanism
  how the Acrobat plugin  requests partial pages of the document .
 May be somebody, who knows the details of the pdf format and
 Acrobat plugin's API can find out what have changed in the server
 in this part. I suspect that there might be some error in the byte
 count of the information served during the second stage of the
 Acrobat plugin's request to the server (basically the request for the 
 first page).
 
 I just compared the logs from the .14 server and .12 server, and I see
 that when the server is sending its response to the request for the 1st page
 (2nd stage of the request), there is a consistent 1 byte difference
 (for the same document) between the two versions of the server.
 
 Let me clarify what I call different stages:
 communication between the client and the server:
 (based on the web-server logs)
 1. Request from the client - 
 remote.host - - [02/Nov/2000:14:40:09 -0500] "GET /~user/cv.pdf HTTP/1.0" 200 0
 
 2. 2nd stage: This is a response from .12 server.  .14 sends 12444 bytes.
 
 remote.host - - [02/Nov/2000:14:40:10 -0500] "GET /~user/cv.pdf HTTP/1.0" 206 12445
 remote.host - - [02/Nov/2000:14:40:14 -0500] "GET /~user/cv.pdf HTTP/1.0" 206 1121
 remote.host - - [02/Nov/2000:14:40:15 -0500] "GET /~user/cv.pdf HTTP/1.0" 206 235
 
 This was consistent for all logged attempts to retreive this file (
 under different names to avoid any type of caching on both sides,
 because even with .14 server it works fine upon "reload" - unless
 the client is hung in the first place)
 
 Only on one occasion I saw that .14 server sent completely different (13xxx bytes)
 number of bytes. I am not certain what happened that time, but I think
 the client hung (on WinNT)
 
 
 I hope this helps, and somebody can compare the part of the server source
 responsible for this difference.
 
 
 Best,
 
 Igor
