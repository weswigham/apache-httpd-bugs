SunOS 5.8 Generic_108528-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60

>Description:

Solaris doesn't have (struct tm *)->tm_gmtoff, so the server logs
were written in GMT regardess of the system timezone.
(The well-known Solaris headache)

The Solaris-kludge did exist and worked in 2.0.16 of
srclib/apr/time/unix/time.c:apr_explode_localtime(), but the code
was moved from apr_explode_localtime() to set_xt_gmtoff_from_tm() 
around version 1.38.

So the attached patch will use tm_to_exp() (which calls 
set_xt_gmtoff_from_tm()) in apr_explode_localtime(), which fixed the problem.

Public APR fuction API is not changed.

>How-To-Repeat:

* Compile on a Solaris2 machine.
* Invoke the httpd on a non-GMT timezone environment.
* Access the server and see the log; 
  the time is logged in GMT.

>Fix:

##dist7
#
#****** srclib/apr/time/unix/time.c Solaris-timezone.patch
#
# Fixes that on Solaris, access_log is always logged in GMT regardess of
# timezone setting. (a well-known Solaris thingie)
#
# The Solaris-kludge was moved from apr_explode_localtime() to 
# set_xt_gmtoff_from_tm() in v 1.38, so use tm_to_exp() 
# (which calls set_xt_gmtoff_from_tm()) in apr_explode_localtime().
