Internet Expl. works fine but Netscape simply displays the script. I have tried everything possible and it all points to apache.

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly not caused by a bug in Apache.
Since you don't give any information about where this page
is, or exactly what is on it, we can't help you.  This is
probably a very basic javascript issue; Apache doesn't do
anything special with javascript, it is up to the client
to deal with it.  I suggest you ask on a client oriented newsgroup.

 This is the script:
 <HTML>
 <HEAD>
 <script language=3D"javascript">
 location.replace("http://mweb.fdy.moc.com/start/ ");</SCRIPT>
 
 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
 
 <P>&nbsp;</P>
 
 </BODY>
 </HTML>
 this script works fine for Internet Explorer, and If I move this script to =
 an IIS server, it will work for netscape too. Unfortunately I have to keep =
 it on apache
 
 I appreciate any help you can give.=20
 
 Thank You,=20
