Any
>Description:
I want to be able to at least define a script which I can write myself to handle
the BROWSE method which the AolPress 2.0 browser uses.

Defining:
Script BROWSE .....
results in error message 'Unknown method type for Script' and the server will not start.

If BROWSE was allowed by the server, I could implement what it does in a perl script,
and it would make the use of AolPress so much better, as I could then browse the
server - ie see all the objects on the server as if I was actually logged in to
it and doing an ls of the server root.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Modify http_protocol.c to accept BROWSE ?  Not sure if that is enough.

State-Changed-By: lars
State-Changed-When: Sun May  9 12:06:17 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:

The BROWSE method is a proprietary extension of the
HTTP protocol (and not part of the WebDAV specifications).
It is unlikely that a standard distribution of Apache
will support this method in the future.

 I appreciate that, but I'm only asking that I don't have to hack the
 source to ALLOW this method.  Wouldn't it be possible for the Apache
 group to make the simple change to permit user-defined methods instead
 of giving the error 'METHOD NOT ALLOWED' ?
 
 Thanks!
