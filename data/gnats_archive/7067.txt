>Description:
I've built Apache 1.3.9 before many times with the following flags. 
   ./configure     --enable-shared=max    --enable-module=most 

However it fails under Redhat 7

Delete this, but let me know please, if it's not
Apache's problem.

Does it work if you use 1.3.14?

 Please try the latest release, or if possible the latest version from
 CVS. Doesn't 1.3.9 predate RedHat 7?

 Yes, but 1.3.9 is our production environment. 
 
 It actually looks for <db.h> under /usr/include, while Redhat 7 has it
 moved under /usr/include/db1/.
 
 I did get the compile to finish by putting -I/usr/include/db1 as an extra include
 in src/Configuration.tmpl. 
 
 I also applied the Redhat update RPM
 http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHBA-2000-132.html 
 but that didn't do the trick by itself. 
 
 Thank you for your support. I haven't heard back from Redhat at all. 
 
 Regards,
 Sonam

 Yes it does predate, and 1.3.14 build perfectly well on RH7. 
 However our production servers (in 2 countries) are 1.3.9 
 
 Enclosed email I'd sent marc on fixing this.

 from /usr/include/db1 
 
 I also applied the Redhat update RPM

 (don't know how useful that was)
