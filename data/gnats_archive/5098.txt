>Environment:
Linux 2.2.12 (IBM JDK 1.1.8)
>Description:

In JServConnection.java all CGI variables are put into the env_vars
hashtable, ex:

env_vars.put("PATH_INFO", in.readString(""));

And since in.readString() never return null, getPathInfo() will never
return null.
>How-To-Repeat:

Status page for Cocoon will break.
>Fix:

Only add em to the hashtable, if they are set.
