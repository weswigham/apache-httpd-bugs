Message dump from error.log after turning debug on in mod_webapps

[Tue Feb 26 22:41:06 2002] [warn] module mod_webapp.c is already added, skipping

Syntax error on line 984 of /etc/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid virtual host for deployment
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start: httpd could not be started


httpd.conf file has the following lines in it afer all other LoadModules.
LoadModule webapp_module libexec/mod_webapp.so
AddModule mod_webapp.c


and at the very end of the httpd.conf file.

WebAppConnection conn warp localhost:8008
WebAppDeploy examples conn /examples/
#WebAppInfo /webapp-info

As far as i can see from the code it is never initialising the host variable in mod_webapp, but as i don't know the code enough I would not like to modify it, but do need to get apache 1.3.23 and tomcat 4.0.1 working together on this linux machine.
>How-To-Repeat:
I downloaded the source for apache 1.3.23, tomcat 4.0.1 and mod_webapps 1.0.1-tc401.
compiled and installed apache with mod_so installed as per apache docs.
compiled and installed tomcat as per tomcat docs.
compiled and installed mod_webapps as per tomcat/mod_webapps docs.

I cannot seem to get around this.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Sun Mar  3 11:30:26 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
Since this is almost certainly a Tomcat problem,
I suggest you take it up with the Tomcat developers
(or even better, the tomcat-users mailing list)
under:
http://jakarta.apache.org/

Thanks for using Apache.
