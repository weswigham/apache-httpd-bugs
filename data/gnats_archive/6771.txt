>Description:
I came across the same problem as 6705, which is that when you install JServ 1.1.2 on a Win32 system with Apache 1.3.14, the server won't start. It works fine with Apache 1.3.12. This is because of the following line that is added to the httpd.conf file:

Include "C:\Program Files\Apache JServ 1.1.2\conf\jserv.conf"

and my interpretation is that it is caused by the following code in src/os/win32/os.h:


__inline int ap_os_is_path_absolute(const char *file)
{
  /* For now, just do the same check that http_request.c and mod_alias.c
   * do. 
   */
  return file && (file[0] == '/' || (file[1] == ':' && file[2] == '/'));
}

in 1.3.12, the check for file[2] == '/' wasn't there.
>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
two options:
1. change the ap_os_is_path_absolute() function to:
  return file && (file[0] == '/' || (file[1] == ':' && (file[2] == '/' || file[2] == '\')));
In fact, even better would be something like isDirectorySeparator(file[2]).
2. fix the JServ installation program to use / instead of \
