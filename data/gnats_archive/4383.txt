>Description:
I tried to set up apache for virtual servers when I noticed
 a problem with the hardcoded documentroot in suexec.c
I want to have each virtual server with its own user (and group id) and
cgi-bin directory. With to ordinary setup this leads to an "command not 
in docroot" error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try a setup as above
>Fix:
There are two possibilities which both lead to reduced security:
1. Set the DOCROOT to the least common path (which may be /, i.e. effectivly disables this check)
2. (What I did) Compare the commandpath to the DOCUMENT_ROOT enviroment
   variable as given by apache. (May be forged easily and effectivly disables this check.)

State-Changed-Why:

This is not a bug, but a known facet of suexec's operation.
You have already identified the solutions.  You can use
different users and groups on a per-vhost basis, but the
docroot issue remains.
