>Description:
mod_mime_magic uses open() without alarm protection.  It should use popen().

Look for aplog_error() lines followed by NOTREACHED -- there's at least one
in magic_process() which is wrong.  It is definately reached, aplog_error
doesn't abort anything.

What's a "BOINK" error?  A bit more informative would be good.

It should use the spawn functionality rather than fork()/exec() ... because
it has potential resource leaks as it is right now.

In 1.3b3:

Bug Fixes:

- gzip -cdq requires at least 4k of a partial gzipped file, we
were sending it only 1k, and it wouldn't produce any output.  But raising
HOWMANY to 4k has implications on the performance of the (lame) ascmagic()
code.  So ascmagic() cheats and only looks at 1k (the previous HOWMANY
setting)

- use spawn_child() interface to avoid a resource leak (zombie
child); I don't think even worked on WIN32 before, but it might now... I
special case and use spawnvp() on WIN32.

- use pfopen()/popenf() to avoid resource leaks

Cleanups:

- no need to test return from palloc since it never returns NULL

- ensure all log messages include the module name

- Some cases were assuming that aplog_error was a never returning
    function.  Deal gracefully by propagating an error code back
    up the call chain.

- remove some useless code in fsmagic() -- we don't use lstat(), we
    use stat() so the only possibility where we'll get S_IFLNK is
    if it's a broken symlink.

- for various errors just DECLINE rather than cause the phase to abort
    early (a lesson we're learning from all the M_PUT changes we've
    had recently)
