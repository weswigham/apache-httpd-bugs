Windows 2000 server
>Description:
We have an apache server with mod_ssl.

The SSL connection works fine within out network(intranet).

But from outside(internet), users reach the apache server through NAT. They are able to see the http page but are not able to see https page. 

The apache server's ip address is not visible to outside users since the NAT does the network address translation. The external users use an external ip address which is redirected to apache ip address by NAT.

The following Virtual Host directive is used in the apache httpd.conf

SSLMutex sem
SSLRandomSeed startup builtin
SSLSessionCache none

<VirtualHost apache.server.ip.address:443>
SSLEngine On
SSLCertificateFile conf/ssl/apache-server.cert
SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/ssl/apache-server.key
</VirtualHost>

Any help would be highly appreciated

State-Changed-Why:

Since this is a mod_ssl problem, and we don't distribute
SSL with Apache 1.3, we can't help you.  I suggest you
try the mod_ssl users mailing list.

Thanks for using Apache!
