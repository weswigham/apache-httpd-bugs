>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 6.2 with all official updates from ftp.redhat.com (RPM packages) up to date, official release of Apache 1.3.20 compiled with "./configure --prefix=/apache --enable-module=all --enable-shared=max".
>Description:
What do I want:
To redirect all requests coming to my server with URI's starting with /something to http://www.somewhere.com/somethingelse. I do want the rest of the URI, following /something, to be appended at the end of the new URL (following somethingelse).

Scenario 1:
Put "Redirect /something http://www.somewhere.com/somethingelse" between <Directory "/usr/local/apache/docs"> and </Directory>. /usr/local/apache/docs is the DocumentRoot.

Scenario 2:
Put "Redirect /something http://www.somewhere.com/somethingelse" as the last line in httpd.conf.

Scenario 2 works perfectly. The problem, and the bug which I am reporting, is that scenario 1 does not work correctly for URI's which contain question mark. It cuts off the question mark and all following characters. Example: /something/script?param=value is redirected to http://www.somewhere.com/somethingelse/script and ?param=value is lost!

document this misbehaviour for 1.3.20 and fix it (if possible) for 1.3.21
