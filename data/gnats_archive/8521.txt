>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2K Server, SP2, 128MB, PIII 450Mhz
>Description:
I removed apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src.msi (which was running fine as a service), then tried to install apache_1.3.22-win32-no_src.msi.

During the install, I got an error message saying it could not detect TCP/IP networking installed on the computer.  It did not install Apache as a service, only as a standalone, console-started application.  After I manually started Apache, it ran OK with my existing httpd.conf.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to install apache_1.3.22-win32-no_src.msi on Windows 2K Server SP2.
>Fix:
Install TCP/IP detection code failing?

 Where did you download the .msi from (dev.apache.org or www.apache.org?)
 What file did you download?  Please check the current release version
 at http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/ and report back,
 thanks!

 Ted, this is not a problem for the files in /dist/httpd/binaries/win32. The
 MSI files in /dist/httpd are incorrectly built. See PRr#8543. My problem was
 with apache_1.3.22-win32-src.msi. However apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.msi  from
 /dist/httpd/binaries/win32 gives no problems.
