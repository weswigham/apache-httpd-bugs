>Environment:
I have observed this bug in two environments:
1. BSD/OS sb946.web2010.com 4.2 BSDI BSD/OS 4.2 i386 unknown
   Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) PHP/4.0.4 FrontPage/4.0.4.3
2. win32 Apache 1.3.19

It is _not_ present under:
BSD/OS w153.web2010.com 4.0.1 BSDI BSD/OS 4.0 i386 unknown
Apache/1.3.11 (Unix) FrontPage/4.0.4.3 PHP/3.0.14
>Description:
The HTML shown below is from an "index.shtml" page that may be passed a query string to select the page to display in the "mainFrame" window.
It works correctly under Apache 1.3.11, but with Apache 1.3.14 (and .19), the '<' and '>' of the FRAME command are replaced with "&lt;" and "&gt;", respectively.
This causes the HTML FRAME command to be interpreted as text, rather than a FRAME command, and the window remains blank.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Thu May 17 09:41:36 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

See the new "encoding" option to the "echo" element
in the mod_include docs.

It was necessary to change the default behaviour to
prevent some nasty security problems.  See the
details on the "cross-site scripting" security problem.

Thanks for using Apache.
