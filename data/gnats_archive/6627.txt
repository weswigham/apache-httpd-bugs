State-Changed-Why:
It looks like you have a problem with your server that is
preventing apache child processes from exiting, and this is
preventing you from starting the server again. Perhaps your
NFS server isn't responding. 

Anyway, this isn't a bug in Apache, it's a problem with your
setup, so I'm closing this PR.
