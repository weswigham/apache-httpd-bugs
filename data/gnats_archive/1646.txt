>Description:
First, this is NOT a bug in Apache, but a peculiarity in Sun's compiler driver
that makes it appear as if the sources cannot compile cleanly.
If during "make" the user's PATH includes /usr/ucb, then the compiler puts
/usr/ucbinclude ahead of /usr/include on the -I path and links with dynamic
libraries from /usr/ucblib. The result are a few compile problems that can
be fixed, or so it seems (I can give details, if you wish). The resulting
binary will not run correctly, however; most notable are mangled fancy
directory listings, probably caused by /usr/ucbinclude/sys/dir.h vs.
/usr/include/sys/dirent.h (the first two characters of every file name are
missing, and other formatting problems).

The resulting binary will have /usr/ucblib/libucb.so.? linked in.
If compiled correctly, no /usr/ucb/lib stuff should be there.
>How-To-Repeat:
prepend /usr/ucb to your PATH, then "make"
>Fix:
Mention this problem in the INSTALL docs. Admins using C 4.2 should make
sure that /usr/ucb is not on their path, but /opt/SUNWspro/bin is, so
"cc" can be found. After compile, do a "ldd httpd" and make sure that no
/usr/ucblib stuff is there.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the note; I'm not sure a good place to add it
that doesn't give it undue notice, so leaving it in the 
bug database so that people can find it on a search sounds
like the best idea to me.  Thanks again.
