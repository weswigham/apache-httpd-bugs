os AIX 4.3.2, GCC
>Description:
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.4
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for IBM AIX 4.3 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
collect2: /usr/ccs/lib/libc.a: not an import library
make: *** [dummy] Error 1
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!

State-Changed-Why:
This sounds like a gcc or gcc configuration or other configuration problem.

If you are still having this problem, please ensure that simple C programs (e.g., classic "Hello, world!") build properly with that compiler on that system and open a new PR.

Thanks!
