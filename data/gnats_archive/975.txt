IRIX 5.3, IRIX 6.2, gcc-2.7.2
>Description:
The documentation does not make it clear that <VirtualHost> sections configured
with ports other than the one specified by the main server's Port directive
_must_ be accompanied by a matching Listen directive.  For example, the following
does not work:

----
Port 80
...
<VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:8000>
...
</VirtualHost>
----

However this will:

----
Port 80
...
Listen 192.168.0.1:8000
<VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:8000>
...
</VirtualHost>
----
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Configure ip:port based VirtualHosts to automatically Listen on a particular 
port if it is given in the <VirtualHost> directive and is not being listened
on by default .. maybe.  I've not looked at how Apache parses the configuration
file from a technical point of view, so I don't know if it's feasible or not,
but the form _does_ ask for a suggestion. :-)

You could also just document it better and call it a 'feature'. :)

 It's not possible for apache to figure out if you want to listen on all ip
 addresses port 8080, or just a specific set of addresses port 8080... and
 those are the two options when you're opening up sockets.  So it makes no
 attempt.  This is what Listen is for ... and I suppose the docs could be
 improved.

State-Changed-Why:
The use of Port vs. Listen should be a little more clear with
the current 1.3 docs (not on the site yet).
