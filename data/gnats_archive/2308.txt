>Description:
We're using DMUserFile Authentication to protect our HTML pages. We need the REMOTE_USER 
variable in a CGI script, but we're failing to get it. We've read that the script must
be protected also, so we tried putting our perl script in a directory under our previous
protected directory (like /web/htdocs/protected/cgi-bin), and put the directive 
"ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/htdocs/protected/cgi-bin/" in the srm.conf file. This way the 
the script is read as an html page.
We also put our script under the cgi-bin directory (/web/cgi-bin/auth) and copy the 
.htaccess file there. But this way the protection is simply ignored. The cgi is executed 
and doesn't return the REMOTE_USER variable.

State-Changed-Why:
Please go through the docs again.

Obviously, if you want to get a REMOTE_USER variable then
your script has to be protected.

If you add another ScriptAlias from /cgi-bin/ to the
presumably existing one, then obviously both can't work.
Also note that you have to access the script as /cgi-bin/
instead of /protected/cgi-bin for that to work.

If you want htaccess files to be processed in your cgi-bin
directory, then you have to change the "AllowOverride none"
that is probably listed in your config file for that directory.
