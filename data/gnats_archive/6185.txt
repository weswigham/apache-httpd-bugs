>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
HP-UX 11.0 with latest patches
aCC 3.13/ANSI-C 11.01.01
>Description:
no core dump. htpasswd outputs
    ./htpasswd: unable to create temporary file
    fopen: No such file or directory

When invoked with NULL argument, the hpux implementation returns NULL mostly.
A non-NULL argument should be supplied instead.
>How-To-Repeat:
by executing
    htpasswd -c /tmp/filename user
on a HP-UX 11.0
>Fix:
add a new line:
    char tmpfilename[32];
in addition to the line: 
    static char *tempfilename;

change the line
    tempfilename = tmpnam(NULL);
into
    tempfilename = tmpnam(tmpfilename);
