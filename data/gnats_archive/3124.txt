>Description:
After upgrading from 1.3b3 to 1.3.2 the directive AuthName for use with
password restricted access ceased to work.

I noticed there is now a demand for quotes when using multiple word
AuthName. However, I use a single word, and whether quoted or not
the corresponding field appears as "unknown" in the password dialog
box.

This is the case for several directories with different .htaccess
files and require directives, that all used to work.

The authorization process itself seems to work properly, however.

State-Changed-Why:
You have an ErrorDocument 401 directive, correct?

Does removing that stop this problem?  If so, what is the
ErrorDocument directive pointing to?

For some reason, there are two authentication headers being
sent, one empty.

Do you have any extra modules compiled in?

 > You have an ErrorDocument 401 directive, correct?
 
 Yes.
 
 > Does removing that stop this problem?
 
 Yes! Strange, I always believed that the importance of the 401
 document started _after_ an error had occurred, not before....
 
 > If so, what is the
 > ErrorDocument directive pointing to?
 
 It points to a CGI-script whose purpose is to count the number of
 unsuccessful attempts to access the URLs requiring authorization.

 Yes, it appears the 401 script sent one of them. I don't remember
 the reason for that. It has been this way for many years, starting
 in the "old" days running NCSA httpd. ;-) Maybe it was required
 (or I believed it was required) at some stage. Until now it has
 not caused problems.
 
 Curious as I am, I tried to track down what the difference between
 1.3b3 and 1.3.2 were in handling this situation. It appears that
 while 1.3b3 puts the empty authentication header _after_ the correct
 one, 1.3.2 puts it _before_, thus causing problems.... This is
 illustrated in the dialogues included below with two different
 computers, one running 1.3b3, the other 1.3.2.
 
 Thanks for your time.
 
 
 Cheers,
