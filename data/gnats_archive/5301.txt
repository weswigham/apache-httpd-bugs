>Environment:
Linux Mandrake 6.1, kernel 2.2.13-7mdk, running on a PII/350 w/ 384M RAM. pgcc 1.1.3-3mdk.
>Description:
I'm running a site with many visitors at the same time, normally there are about 80 to 120 clients at the same time, and the visitors often come in and stay for a short time, then leave. The active connections remain in 80 to 120, but there are lots of SYN, CLOSE, FIN_WAIT1 ports left. Apache starts working fine, but after some time (not a regular value), apache will crash the whole Linux box with the following error messages logged:

kernel: Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 3afe02d0
kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 09781000, %cr3 =09781000

>How-To-Repeat:
I'm not sure how to replay this problem, the following maybe helpful:

Create a site, and try to access it with many simultaneous requests, then finish these requests quickly, then start a new turn of simultaneous requests, and so on, after some time, normally 1/2 to 2 hours, apache may crashes the system.
>Fix:
I have no idea on this.

State-Changed-When: Sat Nov 13 08:10:14 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
There is really nothing Apache can do to cause this on a
properly functioning OS.  You really have to raise the issue
in some appropriate Linux forum, since it looks to be a
kernel problem.
