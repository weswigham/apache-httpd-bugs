>Description:
When a URL of the form "http://server.two.com/~*" is given in the
UserDir directive, it doesn't properly translate a URL such as
http://server.one.com/~joeuser/ to http://server.two.com/~joeuser.

The problem occurs because the '*' is the last character in the
userdir value.  When the module code looks for the '*' and points
userdir to the next character, it's at the string terminator, but
it's only checking for a '/'.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
This appears to fix the problem in both 1.1.1 and 1.2b1.  (This diff is
for 1.2b1.  The change is one line later in 1.1.1.)

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 24 21:51:07 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The desired effect can be achieved by adding a '/' to the
end of the UserDir statement in nearly every case.  I have
suggested the patch be applied anyway.
