 Hey Gang,
 
 	You have got to check this out! In an effort to better assist you in 
 providing for the spiritual welfare and warfare of your family members and 
 friends, we have rolled back our audio tape prices from $7.00 per tape to 
 $5.00 per tape. But that's not all.... On top of this huge roll back, we also 
 have added a 10% discount on all items through Christmas. 
 
 	And if that wasn't enough good news for this e-mail, we have just 
 released a brand new tape titled "Sword of Forgiveness". This tape 
 recorded live is a must for everyone. Doug and Eric deliver one of the most 
 moving and effective presentations on the beauty of God and the image of 
 God within each and every one of us. Yet this tape is done with clarity, 
 excitement, energy and intensity. You owe it to yourself, your family 
 members, friends and yes, even your teens to get this tape. This tape is 
 designed to help  better understand the basic elements of the Catholic Faith 
 in a down to earth, electrifying and exciting way.
 
    	Act NOW and purchase some of our best Catholic T-Shirts, Music

 carries with it eternal value....
