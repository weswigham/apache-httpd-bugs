>Description:

We just put up a new virtual site that is using multiple framesets. When this page is opened with Netscape 3.x it will crash Netscape. Originally I thought this was a bug in Netscape, however putting the site on a 1.2.x server it runs without a flaw. No errors are shown to apache.
>How-To-Repeat:

Open http://www.commitmktg.com/work with Netscape v3.x
>Fix:
No clue

State-Changed-Why:
I doubt this is an apache bug.  It's probably either an OS
bug, or a browser bug.  There's two things I can think of
that you should try:

- disable KeepAlive
- add -DNO_WRITEV when compiling apache

Tell me if either of those do the job please... then we can
try to figure out more details of what the bug actually is.
