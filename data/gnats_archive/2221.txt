>Description:
At some point using the documentation I installed on my server, I used
the search field and ended up on the apache.org server and in the middle
of 1.3 docs.  Making the search work locally would be cool, but an intermediate
trick which would be really helpful would be to use the referer field to
figure out that the search originated from an apache installation and
refer back to that server with the results. Also, be sensitive to the 
installed version in the search.

If you like, I'd be happy to take this on if you want to give me access to
the search tool you are using....

State-Changed-Why:
Interesting idea.

For linking this to a local search: CGI scripts would have
to be enabled by default, and right now they aren't. There
could be links to both a local and remote search, though,
but this gets a bit ugly. Maybe

The other idea of using the referer URL seems feasible.
The referer URL can sometimes be blocked by a proxy,
though.

I'm marking this as suspended for future consideration.
If you're still interested in doing this work, you can get
the scripts used on the Apache site either through CVS or
the CVS web gateway. Pointers to both are at
http://dev.apache.org/. I can probably send you the script
as well if you'd like.

 I think perhaps my suggestion wasn't clear.  My point was that many
 local apache installations won't have the search capability SO perform
 the search as it is now done, but generate the result list with
 references to the local apache system's installed docs rather than the
 docs at the search server. 
 
 This does require local install of docs under a standard virtual
 path.  A hidden search form variable could be configured during
 installation to note the local doc root and by its existance enable
 the remote/local configuration.
 
 The advantage of this approach is a serious reduction of load on the
 apache document server, the network, and the end user wanting to 
 read documentation.
 
 At this moment in time, my workload precludes any volunteer activity but
 I'll keep this in mind when I get some space.
