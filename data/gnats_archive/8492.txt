>Description:
My Linux machine is behind a firewall.  The firewall forwards any port 80 or port 443 requests to an internal IP where the Linux server sits.  The virtual host entries require the physical IP of the Linux network interface, not the logical DNS IP obtained from a domain name lookup.

The DNS name/IP used to access the Linux system from the internet is actually connecting to and through an external firewall.  Virtual host needs the physical IP as ifconfig would display, not the logical or domain IP as nslookup will display.

The documentation wasn't clear on this point, but some experimenting found a workable configuration.

Here is a snippet of my working httpd.conf file for this configuration:

# Actual IP is 24.167.11.206:80 is forwarded to internal
# IP 192.168.123.1:80.  Virtual host needs the ifconfig IP, not the DNS IP.
NameVirtualHost 192.168.123.1:80

<VirtualHost 192.168.123.1>          
    ServerAdmin webmaster@arno.com
    DocumentRoot /home/www 
    ServerAlias arno.com *.arno.com
    ServerName www.arno.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.123.1>          
    ServerAdmin kenneth@grimley.org
    ServerName www.grimley.org
    DocumentRoot /home/usr/kenneth/www
    ServerAlias grimley.org *.grimley.org
</VirtualHost>


BTW, thanks for a great product and great documentation!  Craig Arno
>How-To-Repeat:
Buy a commercial internet router (SMC, Netgear, Asante, Linksys, ...), place the Linux machine behind it on a private IP.  Then route web requests through the firewall to the Linux machine.

State-Changed-Why:

Hmmm.  That case is specifically addressed at
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#namevirtualhost

Do you have a specific suggestion on how to improve the
docs?

Thanks.
