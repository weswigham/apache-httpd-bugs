>Description:
The problem is very similar in nature to what is described in the FAQ about  the server not working correctly when a trailing "/" is not found.  If I use a trailing "/" everything is ok.  But, when I remove it everything stops working.  The ServerName is set correctly to hostname but I have a feeling the code does not account for when the port is different than 80 the server in this situation must return http://hostname:port/~username/ and I suspect it is forgetting about the port number. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be able to by starting httpd with a port number different than 80.
>Fix:
Add code to check if the port number is different than 80 and if it is include it in what is sent back to the client

 Is this a virtualhost?  If so have you set the Port directive in it?  I
 can't reproduce this problem.  I test 1.2 with a non-standard port server
 all the time.

 I'm afraid I can't reproduce this problem.  I get the redirect correctly
 with the port.  You'll have to construct a minimal config file which
 reproduces the problem.  For example, here is the config file I used to
 test this, and this file properly generates redirects with the :port.

 Nothing related to this should have changed between 1.2.5 and 1.2.6.  I'm
 beginning to suspect HPUX general lameness.  If so you're going to have to
 try a few things to isolate the problem, because we generally don't have
 access to HPUX. 
 
 First off, can you give 1.2.6 a try?  It hasn't been announced yet.  You
 can get it at <ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/dist/apache_1.2.6.tar.gz>. 
 
 If you have optimizations enabled on your compiler please try disabling
 them. 
 
 Dean

 What exactly is Apache returning?
 
 do something like:
 
 $ telnet hostname 80

 Bellow is what I get. Which seems incorrect.  With out the port number
 the URL will fail.
