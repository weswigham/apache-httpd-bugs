This is problem Bcause the zone properties file and the servlet application is same for both the zones only difference is that they are in different zones.I am really getting a great trouble one zone is working perfect but other zone works fine in the starting but after few request it doesnt shows the result as expected the images are missing and the its just goes white.I dont know what to do Please Help me ASAP.The site is an E-greetings site and it has two zones one e-cards and the other is cartoons e-cards is working fine but cartoons is having problems.The properties file is same and servlets are also same just the queries are differnt for them.Please Help me!
>How-To-Repeat:
I have one url www.e-cards.energy.pl/e-cards/Index for E-cards zone and the other url is www.e-cards.energy.pl/cartoons/Ecard the e-cards zone is perfect but the cartoons is not working and its too slower then the e-cards.
