fopen: Aucun fichier ou répertoire de ce type  (in english : no such file or directory)
httpd: could not open error log file /var/log/ftp/logs/tests-error_log.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type "CustomLog /var/non-existing_directory/log/access.log" and restart apache !
>Fix:
to control if the directory exists in "apachectl configtest", (I think it's too heavy to implement it at each start of apache)

State-Changed-Why:

Unfortunately, the configtest can only do very
basic syntax checking (directive exists, right
number of arguments).  It is impossible for it
to check the validity of all the arguments for
every directive.

Thanks for using Apache!
