Compiling under IRIX 6.5, compiler 7.2.1

No compilation errors

When running the binary I get
29014:httpd: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in httpd: __libc_attr
29014:httpd: rld: Fatal Error: this executable has unresolvable symbols

I've been compiling previous versions of Apache for the last 3 years.
