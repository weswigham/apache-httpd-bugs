>Organization:
>Environment:
WINNT 4.0, Patchlevel
>Description:
When using Netscape(I don't think it is browser dependant) connecting to a SSL site fails. 
The problem is that select reports that the remote socket has data when it doesn't. 
read returns 0 bytes, aborting the loop/connection.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Fix I/O handling similar to routines in buff.c for WIN32.

State-Changed-When: Tue May 19 21:39:07 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
In 1.3b6 we implemented a fix for a bug which was 
causing core dumps for those trying to use CONNECT - 
could you try 1.3b6 and let us know if you still are
seeing this problem?

State-Changed-From-To: analyzed-closed

State-Changed-When: Wed Sep  6 07:55:24 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

This is likely a side effect of the newly corrected
mod_proxy send/recv code.  This issue should disappear
in release 1.3.13.

Thank you for your report and interest in the Apache httpd
project!
