>Environment:
Solaris 2.5 and 2.5.1
Problem occurs using both gcc and original Sun C.
>Description:
Since upgrading from 1.1.1 to 1.2.* (including betas and now 1.2.4) there has been
an obscure problem on three different Suns we have running Solaris 2.5 and 2.5.1.
Symptoms are that some transfers, especially to distant sites, terminate with
in-line graphics or other page elements incompletely transferred.
Sometimes, but not always, the error log contains messages of type "Broken pipe"
that seem correlated with this behaviour. I have not found anything in the
documentation on what this message implies.
The problem is _not_ present when we downgrade to 1.1.1, and _not_ on a Linux
2.0.27 system with Apache 1.2.*. Also, on Linux the "Broken pipe" messages
are absent.
>How-To-Repeat:
An example page that exhibits the problem is http://cheetah.uio.no/csg/spa-ssas.htm
It is only reproducable (it would appear) from distant clients with long download
times.

No. I haven't dug into the source code. Experiments with the KeepAliveTimeout

State-Changed-Why:

Since you are using Solaris please try to tune the
rexmit_interval of your TCP driver with the following
commands:

  ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_min 3000
  ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_initial 3000

Does it fix the problem?

 In addition, be sure you have applied the latest patch cluster from Sun.

 Not entirely, I'm afraid, even though there would appear to be
 some improvement in how frequently the problem occurs.
 
 However, this measure increased _download_speed_ as seen from
 remote sites dramatically, (three times or better) which is always
 a good thing anyway. :-)
 
 The increase in speed is there both with Apache 1.1.1 and in 1.2.4.
 The "scalping" of parts of the transfer is still seen only when
 using the latter.

 cheetah.uio.no is currently at 103640-12. No obvious difference.
 
 Your efforts so far are greatly appreciated....

Would you please verify if you see a lot of
"send body lost connection..." messages in your
error logfile?
In other words, can you confirm that the broken
images you mentioned are accompanied by a message
in your error log?

 There are such messages associated with many, if not all,
 cases of this behavior. It seems to be two "flavors" of the
 phenomenon:
 
 send body lost connection to: xxxxxxxx: Broken pipe
 
 and:
 
 send body lost connection to client xxxxxxxxx
 
 Additionally, there may or may not be messages like:
 
 read request line timed out for xxxxxxxxx
 
 apparently correlated to the problem.

 It is difficult to match the time stamps on the messages
 _exactly_ to what happens at the other end. But there appear
 to be messages like this during every session in which the
 remote client sees broken images.

 If you use SAFE_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT and a single socket then there's no
 accept() serialization so you wouldn't trigger a pthread mutex problem.
 
 I wonder if 1.3 fixes PR#1119.  1.3 again has different network behaviour
 over 1.2... and 1.2 certainly has different behaviour over 1.1. 
 
 I wonder if PR#1119 is related to the bug I've fixed in 1.3 that causes
 the last packet of a transfer to be delayed waiting for the hostname
 lookup to complete.  This bug, which I'd been considering a performance
 problem only, exists in 1.2 because of the changes to improve pipelined
 HTTP/1.1 connections.  It doesn't exist in 1.1 because 1.1 bflush()s all
 over the place. 
 
 I've cc'd the PR#1119 submitter... Jon could you try disabling
 HostnameLookups (or try 1.3b3) and see if the problem goes away?  If so
 I'll try to backport the fix from 1.3 to 1.2.

 No change.

 Yes! Even _with_ HostnameLookups! We have run our auxiliary server
 (cheetah.uio.no) with 1.3b3 for three weeks now. During that time
 several tests have been carried out by the distant user who alerted
 me of the of the problem, and who kindly has assisted in trying to
 debug what seems only to appear at the other end of "long lines".
 We have waited this long in replying to be as certain as possible
 of the conclusion that the problem is gone.
 
 We will now see what happens when I take our main server (lynx.uio.no)
 from 1.1.1 (which I had to downgrade it to due to this problem) to
 1.3b3....
 
 To me it would seem that HostnameLookups itself was not a correct
 theory, but that something else of importance has been changed
 (maybe inadvertently in this context?) from 1.2.* to 1.3b3.

State-Changed-Why:

Submitter responded that the problem does not occur with
1.3b3 (probably due to the bflush() changes from 1.2 to 1.3).

Thanks for you patience in working this out and thanks
for using Apache.
(By the way, if you upgrade your main server you may
 want to wait for 1.3b4 which will be released next week.)
