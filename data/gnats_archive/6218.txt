>Description:
'If you start to use virtual hosts you should stop to use the "main server" as an independent server and rather use it as a place for configuration directives that are common for all your virtual hosts.' wording is awkward. Better would be:

'If you start to use virtual hosts you should stop using the "main server" as an independent server and rather use it as a place for configuration directives that are common for all your virtual hosts.
