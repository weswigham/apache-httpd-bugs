>Description:
In this proxy-heavy age all kinds of pages can be cached when they shouldn't.  mod-expire is very nice, but sometimes it isn't that a page is expired, just that it is unique - i.e. generated from longtime cookie based data.  Someone elses page shouldn't be served up, it can be embarrassing.

I'm asking for "ExpiresByType" but for headers;
so that
HeaderForType application/shtmlthingy-etc Pragma: NoCache
HeaderForType application/shtmlthingy-etc Vary: All the time you dobbin
can be set
>How-To-Repeat:
You have to have a few hundred customers who sit behind one of those over-imaginive implicit-secret-intercept-you-port-80-syn-sent-things proxies.
>Fix:
Add HeaderForType ?
