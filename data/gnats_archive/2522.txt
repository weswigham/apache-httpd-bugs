refer PR 2217 (and others)
There are several problems where user's logs files have filled up for various
reasons, it would be a good thing if this could be avoided.  

(I know, there are various workarounds that can be implemented when a problem, 
usually a config problem, is indentified).  But it would avoid a number of 
servers needlessly failing.  (FWIW I am regularly suffering such symptoms in 
my test environment, but I believe it is a problem with a my config, so I'll 
do more testing before posting my problem about the following message which 
is only stoppable through a reinit.cmd)
[Sun Jun 28 00:03:59 1998] select: (listen): Socket operation on non-socket
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
When an item is written to an error log, the last and 2nd last written entry should be checked.
If this error is the same, a 'special' entry should be written, saying last msg repeated n times.
This line could then be updated everytime the message is immediately repeated.
Such an entry would stop logs from over-flowing with the same message looped.

State-Changed-Why:
Upgrade to 1.2.6, this is one of the things that was dealt with.
From src/CHANGES:

  *) Increase the robustness of the child_main loop.  When unexpected
     select() or accept() errors occur we exit() the child.  This deals
     with many reported problems where apache would fill the error_log
     with messages.  [Dean Gaudet] PR#1747, 1107, 588, 1787, 987, 588


But there's no comparisons to reduce log messages -- given that
any number of children can be logging, there's not a heck of a lot
we can do.  If you want that, use piped logs and filter there.
