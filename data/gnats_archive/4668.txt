Using the following parameters

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/jserv --srcdir=. --with-apache-install=/opt/Apache1.3.6/  --with-jdk-home=/opt/jdk1.2/ --with-jsdk=/opt/jdk1.2/lib/jsdk.jar --enable-apache-conf

 Apache JServ's configure script is looking for the SOURCE (not BINARY)
 installation with the --with-apache-install. If the SOURCE installation is
 really in that directory in /opt, then you should confirm that the
 /src/modules/jserv directory exists, if not, I suggest that you re-install
 Apache because something with your installation is messed up.
 
 This is not a bug with the configuration script, it is a bug with your
 installation. ;-(
