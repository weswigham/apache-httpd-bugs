>Environment:
Windows 2000 (but it's a Java problem. So this is not important)
>Description:
The ServletContext interface is implemented by the JservContext class, but the two method getAttribute and SetAttribute (and the derived methods like deleteAttribute) aren't implemented.

This seem to be not important, but I use it to make a ConnectionPool accessible by many servlets simultanously. This works with Java web server. So, I think this shall be a must for you if this can works.
>How-To-Repeat:
By installing Microsoft IIS :) By this way, you can have all problem that you want.
>Fix:
One solution is to let me fix the bug and add me to your members list. I'm working on it. If the problem is presently fixed for the next version, please notice me and if you can : send me the JservContext.java file....
