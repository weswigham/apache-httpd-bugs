>Description:
In the apache documentation htdocs/manual/windows.html#run
It mentions using http://localhost/ to access the a locally running apache
server.  Unfortunately, if you have a dial-up access account and are not online
then that does not work.  You need to enter http://127.0.0.1 to get it to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
start up the computer and without going online start apache and netscape, type
in localhost and hit reload.  It won't work.
P.S. It DOES work if you were online and didn't close netscape lately.  
Closing and restarting Netscape will show the problem again (so we don't get
confused :-)
>Fix:
Underneath the section to type "http://localhost/" add another line saying
"or failing that http://127.0.0.1" or something along those lines.
Then a good knowledge of IP addressing will not be necessary in order
to test out apache.
