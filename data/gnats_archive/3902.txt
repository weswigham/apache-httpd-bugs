>Environment:
Windows 95, Apache 1.3.4, JServ 1.0b2 release "ApacheJServ1.0b2-Apche1.3.4.exe".
>Description:
Apache 1.3.4 JServ 1.0b2 release, ApacheJServ1.0b2-Apche1.3.4.exe, states that it is for version 1.3.3 when it it installing ("To install Apache JServ 1.0b2ap1.3.3 on this system the following requirements must be met..." and "Have fun with Apache JServ 1.0b2ap1.3.3".).  After installation, when Apache is run ("integrated" mode), it says that "JServ 1.0b1 running", rather than 1.0b2.  The documentation states "Note:Because of issues with the way that DLL's work, the DLL version is specific for Apache 1.3.3 and 1.3.4. Please make sure to download and install the appropriate .exe installer for your version of Apache.", so it seems that any version discrepancies may be important.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download the JServ 1.0b2 file for Windows and install it. Notice the references to Apache 1.3.3.  Then run Apache 1.3.4.  Notice the reference to 1.0b1.
>Fix:
Bundle the correct version of the code with the distribution, or fix incorrect version information displayed during installation or server start-up.

State-Changed-Why:
This does not appear to be a bug in Apache per se, but possibly in either the documentation or implementation of Jserv.
