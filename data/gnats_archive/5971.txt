>Environment:
We installed APACHE web-server on REDHAT LINUX using gcc.
>Description:
158 processes: 157 sleeping, 1 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:  3.6% user,  4.0% system,  0.0% nice, 92.2% idle
Mem:  1036364K av, 1030768K used,   5596K free, 193896K shrd, 156260K buff
Swap: 2096440K av,   2284K used, 2094156K free

As you see, the used memory closed to the full memory.
Actually, we just rebooted the LINUX system a day ago.
I am not sure the cause of that, but I am afraid that APACHE have the problem of memory leak. anyway, if you know about this problem , Could you send me the mail about solving this memory-shaply-growing-up.
If I upgrade the latest APACHE, Would I solve this problem?

State-Changed-Why:

Linux tends to use free/unused memory for disk buffering.

Unless the memory usage of the httpd processes
itself increases significantly there is nothing
to worry about.
