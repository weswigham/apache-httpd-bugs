>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, gcc 2.7.2.3, gdbm 1.7.3
>Description:
This is the identical problem to PR#2027.  I have verified it exists in 1.3b6 and 1.3.0.

As an aside.  If you use -L /usr/ucblib and -ldbm to include the "standard" dbm packages on Solaris you get a sef fault.  If you use -lgdbm you get the error message desribed in PR#2027 in error_log.

dbmmanage has no complaints and works properly.

I presume it is how the name is being passed to mod_auth_dbm.  The code in mod_auth_dbm seems correct, but I didn't see where a seperate dbm_open was being done for the group file if it was not the same file as the user file.

Has any progress been made on this problem?
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a directory protected by auth_dbm.  Try to access.  MSIE will give an "invalid response" error and Netscape will give an "empty content" error.  A check of the error_log will show the ture problem as being "file xxx not found".
>Fix:
I have no idea what is doing this.  I tried a different approach to the logic, but with the same results.  I suspect that the filename being passed into the module is wrong.
