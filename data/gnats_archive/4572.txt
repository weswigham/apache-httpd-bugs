>Description:
jserv_mmap.c lines 104 and 112 need additional parentheses:

104:    if (nb = write (fd, &h, sizeof(h)) !=  sizeof(h)) {
	    /* error */
            jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_EMERG,cfg,"jserv_mmap:error writing ");
        }
	for (i=0;i<NB_MAX_JSERVS;i++) {
	    js[i].state = DOWN;
	    js[i].name[0] = '\0';
	}
112:    if (nb = write (fd, js, sizeof(js)) !=  sizeof(js)) {
            ....

Notice that the != takes precedence over the = in these
would-be assignments.  Correct is to say
if ((nb = write (fd, js, sizeof (js))) != sizeof(js)) { ...
