>Description:
I figure this is a change request, not a bug, no matter what other people say.
In order to keep things happy that like to see HTTP/1.0 when they make an
HTTP/1.0 request, change http_protocol.c to return r->protocol instead of
SERVER_PROTOCOL, and define SERVER_PROTOCOL to be HTTP/1.0 as a default (for
all those legacy modules that don't know Jack about HTTP/1.1).  This
allows all the HTTP/1.1 functionality to work, but doesn't break anything that
currently is out there.  Apache would no longer "advertise" its HTTP/1.1
availability, but hey, welcome to life, if you wannit, you gotta ask . . .
>How-To-Repeat:
Find an AOL user who is peeved at Apache 1.2 users, or an Apache 1.2 user that is
peeved at AOL users.  Run Astra or another robotic site mapper.  Sit on the
other side of a proxy that demands HTTP/1.0.
>Fix:
If this context diff is legible, use it.  If not, try the above by hand.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 24 18:00:23 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
A feature to allow you to selectively do this was added in
revision 1.15 of mod_access.c and 1.89 http_protocol.c, 
which will be available in 1.2b5 when it comes out.

Doing it for all clients was debated at length, however it
does break certain things so we decided against it.
