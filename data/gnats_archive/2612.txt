>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 with recommended patches current to July 1998
SunOS darkwing 5.6 Generic_105181-06 sun4d sparc
>Description:
We discovered during our most recent reboot that Apache 1.3.0 did not start
at boot because a process existed that was not the master HTTPD process but
which had the same PID as in the existing httpd.pid file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Boot without auto-starting Apache.  Somehow create a process with the same PID
as the Apache HTTPD that was running before the reboot.  Run "apachectl start".
>Fix:
The patch appended below modifies the 'grep' in the apachectl script so that it
matches "$PID.*httpd" instead of just "$PID"; this prevents apachectl from
falsely recognizing a different process as the master httpd.  (Line numbers
differ from the distributed apachectl because of further local customizations
to our installed apachectl script.)
