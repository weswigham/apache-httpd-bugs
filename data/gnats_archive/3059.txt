SunOS natasha 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I switched what used to be the main server to a named-based
virtual host under Apache 1.3.1.  Apache doesn't execute SSIs that 
get output from CGI code.  (Regular SSIs within .shtml files work fine)

Note: I have done extensive testing on this.....I am fairly sure it is a bug.

Here is the vhost config:
<VirtualHost vhost.mathworks.com>
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\""
ServerName vhost.mathworks.com
ServerAdmin dave@mathworks.com
DocumentRoot /docroot
TransferLog /somewherethatexists/accesslog
ErrorLog /somewherethatexists/errorlog
<Directory /docroot>
AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit Options
Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks Includes Indexes
AddHandler cgi-script cgi
AddHandler cgi-script pl
AddHandler cgi-script pm
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

There are no more specific <Directory> definitions anywhere.

This works find under 1.3.1 *so long as it's not a name-based virtual host.*

This appears in the rendered HTML source (so it didn't execute):
<!--#include virtual="/sitenav_frame.shtml"-->
>How-To-Repeat:
Only available inside firewall....sorry!
>Fix:
Not yet.....haven't had time to go through the source and see what changed.
But from the Changelog it seems that mod_include has seen recent work.

 Also, I forgot to mention that there is no error message logged in the
 error log when one of these pages gets loaded.

State-Changed-Why:
The output from CGIs has _NEVER_ been parsed for SSIs, so
I suggest you check a bit more closely what you think you
were doing with 1.3.1...

 I described this problem quite poorly, in retrospect.  I apologize.
 Of course you're right about SSIs not being handled when in the CGI
 handler.  That's not what I'm really having a problem with.  
 
 Please keep the ticket open or tell me to open a new one, with a better
 description, if that is more appropriate.
 
 Thanks,

 Just tell us what is actually happening...
 
 You said that SSIs in .shtml files work fine, so what doesn't work?
