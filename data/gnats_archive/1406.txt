>Description:
The problem is that the QUERY_STRING environment variable is NOT being set
correctly for non-parsed header scripts.  Apparently, the QUERY_STRING is
considered to be a filename, and is expanded according to UNIX rules,
including wildcards.

Here's a simple non-parsed-header script (call if nph-test-cgi):

--------------------------------- cut here ------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

echo HTTP/1.0 200 OK
echo Content-type: text/plain
echo Server: $SERVER_SOFTWARE
echo

echo CGI/1.0 test script report:
echo

echo argc is $#. argv is "$*".
echo

echo QUERY_STRING = $QUERY_STRING
--------------------------------- cut here ------------------------------------

Assume your web server's domain name is "web.server.com".
Go to the following URL:  http://web.server.com/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?*

The output from the CGI will not be quite what you would expect.
You would expect that QUERY_STRING environment variable would equal "*",
but instead it contains a listing of ALL of the files in the "cgi-bin"
directory.  It also allows relative paths, so that the URL

http://web.server.com/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?../*

will give you a listing of all of the files/directories in the "cgi-bin"
directory's parent directory.

By the way, the above script behaves properly if the script is NOT a
non-parsed-header script.  That is, the QUERY_STRING environment variable
is equal to "*".
>How-To-Repeat:
See full description.
>Fix:
Attempt to set the QUERY_STRING environment variable in the same way (perhaps
using the same code), whether the script is a non-parsed-header script or not

State-Changed-Why:
Your script is what is doing the expansion.  The script
you give behaves exactly the same way both when done as a
nph- script and a non-nph script; both ways it displays
the list of files.

This is a bug in your script.  You either need to disable
filename globbing (set -f) or put double quotes around your
string.

I suspect that if you look again you will find it does
happen for non-nph scripts if they are written exactly
the same.
