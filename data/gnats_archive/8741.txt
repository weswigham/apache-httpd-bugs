OSF1 www.mpch-mainz.mpg.de V5.1 732 alpha
>Description:
After running our apache-server for several days (4 to 5) 
(Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) ApacheJServ/1.1 mod_fastcgi/2.2.6 PHP/3.0.11 mof_ssl/2.6.2 OpenSSL/0.9.5)
the server is no longer accessable sending the error-message (error_log):

System:Too many open files (errorno: 24)
[client "xxx"] (24)Too many open files: file permissions deny server access: "yyy"

where "xxx" is the client trying to access the server (any who wants to get access at this time)
and "yyy" is the file on the server he wants to access (for any file on the server)

After restarting the public web-server the error disappears and is repeated running 4 to 5 days without problems.

State-Changed-Why:

You are likely leaking file descriptors someplace.  It is
highly unlikely that this is happening in the core apache
server, since we would have seen many other reports.
Therefore there isn't much that we can do.

Two suggestions:

1. Upgrade to the latest version.  1.3.12 is rather old.

2. Try setting MaxRequestsPerChild to some finite number
(no 0) to see if that helps.

Thanks for using Apache!
