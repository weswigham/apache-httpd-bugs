AIX, dunno
>Description:
Many browsers supply a "Referer: xxx" header line, quoting the URL
from which the current GET request comes from. This is very useful
when making statistics, usage, hits count etc. Please ... :)
>How-To-Repeat:
The log line format is in the docs, Referer is missing.
>Fix:
An option may be needed to preserve log file format compatibility

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Apr  8 11:23:21 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Apache has several ways to log the referrer info
in current versions, including mod_log_referrer and
setting up your own custom log format in mod_log_config.
We can't add features to old versions only new ones.
