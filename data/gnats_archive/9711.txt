>Description:
Between Apache 1.3.22 and 1.3.23 the conf/httpd.conf-dist file has had
the (commented out) AddType directives for PHP removed. This is
most unhelpful to new users since they now have to know what to type, rather than simply uncomment the appropriate line. Many of the other changes to httpd.conf-dist look 'gratuitous'.

diff from the 1.3.22 -> 1.3.23 starts:
768,778d767
<     # For example, the PHP 3.x module (not part of the Apache distribution - see
<     # http://www.php.net) will typically use:
<     #
<     #AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3
<     #AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps
<     #
<     # And for PHP 4.x, use:
<     #
<     #AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
<     #AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
< 
[SNIP]

>How-To-Repeat:

Diff the httpd.conf-dist files between 1.3.22 and 1.3.23
>Fix:

Re-instate the PHP4 lines (commented out) in the default configuration file:
     # For PHP 4.x, use:
     #
     #AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
     #AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
