Native cc, ld.
GNU Make version 3.74, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
Vanilla installation with "-fullwarn" added to CC options.
>Description:
There are missing function prototypes in a number of modules.

Most are innocuous though at least one is potentially problematic on
some platforms (default int function in "%s" context; get_time() in http_log.c).

I'd suggest you add all missing prototypes; it gives me and I suspect most
other users the `warm fuzzies' to compile with full warnings and see none;
it tells me that you've checked and made sure there are no potentially
memory corrupting default casts like the above.

Also, a minor nit: the problem report form name and email address boxes are
too small; you may want to widen them.

Don't bother replying to this report unless you feel the need;
I know you're busy. Congratulations on a superb piece of software.

>How-To-Repeat:
Do a vanilla make with full warnings (-Wall or -fullwarn) switched on.
>Fix:
Add prototypes in include files for:

block_alarms(), unblock_alarms(), cleanup_scoreboard(),
count_idle_servers(), accept_mutex_on(), accept_mutex_off(),
one_process) detach (), close_unused_listeners (), set_group_privs (),
set_signals (), wait_or_timeout (), find_free_child_num (),
count_idle_servers (), find_free_child_num (), show_directives(), 
reclaim_child_processes(), init_alloc(), update_scoreboard_global (),
show_modules(), setup_prelinked_modules(), init_suexec(),
set_group_privs(), clear_module_list (), cleanup_for_exec(),
get_time()

Also, unprototyped anonymous functions calls in http_config.c like:

   (*cmd->func) (parms, mconfig, w)

could be fixed with casts.

 Yeah I included fixes for most of this in a patch to try to clean up 64-bit
 support.  But we're still arguing how best to deal with that... (I admit
 I got lazy at the prospect of fixing all the function pointer casts.)
 
 Thanks

Already part of a proposed 64-bit cleanup patch for the 1.3
