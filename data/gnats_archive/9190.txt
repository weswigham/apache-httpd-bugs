>Description:
While mod_proxy accepts IPv6 connections, it seems not able to connect *to* an IPv6 server.
So:

client ---(ipv6)---> proxy ----(ipv6)----> server
         (works)           (doesn't work)
>How-To-Repeat:
proxy address: http://www.ipv6.polito.it:8080/
(I've opened it to requests coming from domain apache.org)
You can access the proxy in both IPv6 and IPv4
>Fix:
It seems to me that the mod_proxy always use AF_INET, hardcoded into the code.

State-Changed-Why:
A fix was just committed to CVS to allow HTTP proxy connections via IPv6.  It is available now via CVS access
and will be in the next release.

Problems with ftp and proxy CONNECT have not yet been resolved.

Does the fix for HTTP resolve your problem?

FYI...  CONNECT should work with IPv6 now.
