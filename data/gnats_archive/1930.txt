>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP3, VC++ V5.0, Pentium 90, 128MB
>Description:
Using the LoadModule directive, you cannot get the ReWrite module to load.
Apache returns an error stating that the module cannot be found in file
XXX/ApacheModuleReWrite.DLL
>How-To-Repeat:
Easily.  Just try to load the module.
>Fix:
The module declaration in the source file mod_rewrite.c needs to change
from:
    module rewrite_module = {
to:
    module MODULE_VAR_EXPORT rewrite_module = {
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is missing.
           
I changed my copy and rebuilt the DLL and it loads and works fine
