>Description:
Go to http://hyperreal.com/ through Netscape: great, looks gorgeous

telnet to hyperreal.com port 80, and issue a 

  GET / HTTP/1.0

with no other headers, and I get the home page for one of the Host:-header
based home pages, www.grooveneedle.com, which happens to be the last
Host:-header-based vhost section in my httpd.conf.  If I use a Host: header
everything works as it should.
