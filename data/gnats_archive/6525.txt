>Description:
I tried following your HowTo but I always get the same error warn message:

Starting service httpd[Tue Sep 12 18:15:31 2000] [warn] VirtualHost 62.2.69.170:80 overlaps with VirtualHost 62.2.69.170:80, the first has precedence, perhaps you need a NameVirtualHost directive
[Tue Sep 12 18:15:31 2000] [warn] NameVirtualHost 62.2.67.170:80 has no VirtualHosts

It seems that I have a problem configuring httpd.conf file
ServerName www.bugpower.ch
my file:

NameVirtualHost 62.2.67.170

<VirtualHost 62.2.69.170>
        ServerName "www.bugpower.ch"
        DocumentRoot /usr/local/httpd/htdocs2
        ServerAdmin root@localhost
        TransferLog     /var/log/httpd/access_log
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 62.2.69.170>
        ServerName "imap.bugpower.ch"
        DocumentRoot /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/horde
        ServerAdmin phil@bugpower.ch
        TransferLog     /var/log/httpd/access_log
</VirtualHost>

www and imap are cNames in the DNS

State-Changed-Why:
Please examine your config files more carefully and read through
the docs again.  Your NameVirtualHost directive uses a different
IP address than your VirtualHost directive!
