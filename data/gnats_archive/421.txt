>Description:
  When using 'Anonymous_LogEmail' the log message is append to the
  error log multiple times with a single client authentication.

  Test configuration:
    Authname test
    AuthType Basic
    Anonymous anonymous
    Anonymous_Logemail on
    anonymous_verifyemail on
    anonymous_nouserid off
    anonymous_authoritative on

  mod_log_config's 'ErrorLog' was used if this makes a difference.
