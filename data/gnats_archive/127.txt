HP-UX 10.10,

Compiler: Payed for HP-Compiler
>Description:
After running a while I find a core dump in the directory from which I started
the apache-processes. The very strange thing is, that the one of the processes
dumps while it is idle.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The problem seems a compiler problem. If I compile without optimization and with
the Flag for including information for the symbolic debugger I don't have the core
dump.
I am out for this week, next week I will make other experiments and send a more 
detailed description.

State-Changed-Why:
Do you have any further information on this problem?

We have had reports of similar things with HPUX's compiler;
we can't do much about it if it is a compiler 
problem.
