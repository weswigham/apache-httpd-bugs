State-Changed-When: Wed Jul 26 16:55:53 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
It looks like we are not including the header file that
defines h_errno on your machine.  I have been unable to
duplicate this problem on the only HPUX machine I have access
to.

Basically, on my machine, h_errno is defined in netdb.h.  This
header file is included by sockets.c, through networkio.h.

There are two possible causes for this error.

1)  netdb.h doesn't define h_errno.
2)  netdb.h isn't being included on your system.

Please look at netdb.h to determine if it exists, and if it
defines h_errno.  If both of those things are true, then
please look at src/lib/apr/include/apr_private.h and search
for HAVE_NETDB_H.  If this is 1, then we are including the
file and I am at a loss for what is happening.  If it is 0,
then Autoconf can't find the file, and we need to figure out
why.

If netdb.h does not define h_errno.h, please let us know what
header file does define it.

Thank you for the bug report

 ARRRRR!  Sometimes I hate that every Unix platform is this different.  On
 my HP/UX machine, I don't need to have _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED defined to
 get h_errno, but I do need it defined to get a clean build without
 warnings.  Let me look into some stuff, and I'll try to post a patch later
 today to fix this.
