State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: jerenkrantz
State-Changed-When: Tue Feb 26 23:42:07 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
This is due to the fact that your OS (in this case
Linux) is case-sensitive.

Apache is doing the right thing.  Your .JPG files should
be .jpg or you need to copy all of the directives that
say .jpg to say .JPG as well.

Regardless, this is a configuration issue and will be
closed.

Thanks,
Justin Erenkrantz
