>Description:
Once I installed SP2 for MS-Windows 2000, on reinstalling Apache, I found that Apache no longer appears in the Windows services list.  I can still start Apache in a console.  

On systems that Apache is already installed, and after installing SP2 for MS-Windows 2000, Apache is still in the Windows services list and fucntions correctly as a service.  Then, as stated above, it disappears as a MS-Windows service if Apache is reinstalled.

This behaviour is repeatable with Apache version 1.3.19.
