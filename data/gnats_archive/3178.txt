>Environment:
Win NT 4.0 Intel, SP3
MS Visual C++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
WinNT crashed before I could get a backtrace (!), but the function at fault was ap_proxy_cache_error.

It crashed because c->fp was a null pointer, ie c != NULL but c->fp == NULL.

This seems very similar to the case in PR2950. 

cache_req *ap_proxy_cache_error(cache_req *c)
{
    ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, c->req,
		 "proxy: error writing to cache file %s", c->tempfile);
/* CRASH ON NEXT LINE, c->fp == NULL */
    ap_pclosef(c->req->pool, c->fp->fd);
    c->fp = NULL;
    unlink(c->tempfile);
    return NULL;
}
>How-To-Repeat:
*Very* intermittent - only happens about every 50Mb of data that goes through the proxy
>Fix:
cache_req *ap_proxy_cache_error(cache_req *c)
{
    if (c != NULL) {
        ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, c->req,
		     "proxy: error writing to cache file %s", c->tempfile);
        if (c->fp != NULL) {
            ap_pclosef(c->req->pool, c->fp->fd);
            c->fp = NULL;
        }
        unlink(c->tempfile);
    }
    return NULL;
}
