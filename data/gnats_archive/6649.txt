>Description:
While the documentation for 'include file=' explicitly states that relative paths
containing .. are not allowed, the section on 'include virtual=' says that they
are, but fails to say that the ceiling on climbing up the tree is the DocumentRoot,
rather than the ServerRoot, which it appears, by inspection, to actually be.

This makes shared SSI fragment directories impossible to implement.

The alternative, of course, makes it possible for ISP customers sharing one 
server to include each other's stuff, which isn't good either.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Not really; see above.  For servers where all the virtual servers are under
the same span of administrative control, a config file directive could be
created to allow include virtual to go further up the tree, but this would
be a security violation on shared commercial servers.

State-Changed-Why:

Yes, the SSI documentation is pretty vague on
how all the different #include and #exec stuff
fit together.  It could use some work.

Your particular problem could probably be solved 
with an Alias directive.  If you use Alias to
point to your common SSI include directory and map
it into your current URL space for each server,
then #include virtual should be able to access it.
