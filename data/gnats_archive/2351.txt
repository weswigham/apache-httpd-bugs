>Environment:
Windows 95 (i'm using the binaries)
>Description:
We are using CGIs written in C under Windows 95. Our screen is composed of
four frames and each frame is drawned with a different CGI program (so the programs are called very quickly). The problem we have is that we sometimes receive an error message comming from the server telling :

"Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /3.1.0betaendmr-entrypoint/script/index.exe on this server"

After a refresh on the frame, all come back to normal.

State-Changed-Why:
A great deal of work went into CGI support for Win32 after
1.3b6.  1.3b7 is known to be drastically broken, so please
try again with 1.3.0 (which should be released for Win32 in
a matter of days).
