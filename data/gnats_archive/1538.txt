>Release:        1.2.1
>Environment:
Don't know, this is observed behavir on a remote server www.looksmart.com.
>Description:
When using chunked transfer-encoding, the server is sending back one more byte
in its first chunk than it reports in the chunk-size header. This appears to
happen for other chunks as well, but not consistently. E.g., if the header
says "f3e" there are actually 0xf3f data bytes before the CR/LF appears.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.looksmart.com/

This can be verified using, e.g.:
telnet www.looksmart.com 80 > output
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.looksmart.com

Then examine the output file by hand. (I use vi to strip the headers, then
hex dump the remainder of the file to get to the proper byte offset.)
>Fix:
I haven't built this server, just reporting what I've observed from other
running servers. I searched for "chunked" in the bug database and didn't find
anything similar, thus this report. I also read the Changes file, and found no
explicit mention. My apologies if this is already fixed in 1.2.4.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid I can't see where this is happening.  Are
you sure you are removing the last CR and LF properly?
Remember, if it ends in the middle of the line the
last CR and LF need to be removed.  Some editors,
such as vi, do not allow you to do that.

If you are certain that isn't happening, perhaps send
an example?

 The problem could be that you are using telnet.  Try something like nc
 (netcat). 
 
 Your file has:
 
 00000530: 30 20 62 6f 72 64 65 72 3d 30 20 69 73 6d 61 70 | 0 border=0 ismap |
 00000540: 20 20 75 73 65 6d 61 70 3d 23 70 65 72 73 3e 3c |   usemap=#pers>< |
 
 (two spaces before usemap) while any copy I download only has
 1.  Perhaps your telnet is messing things up?

 Sorry for the false alarm. Retrieving the URL from outside our network shows
 no problem. Damn proxy server...

The most wonderful thing about proxies is
proxies are a wonderful thing
their insides are made of spaghetti
their outsides are made for droids
they're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
full of fun, fun, fun
But the most wonderful thing about proxies is--
All of them suck a lot.
Allllllllllllllllllll of them suck a lot.
