>Description:
This initially appears to be a timing problem with IE3. But having fiddled around with things like the timeout and the Send Buffer size until I'm blue in the face. I'm kind of out of ideas as to what to try next. This could alternatively be an issue with the browser itself.
This seems to be only an issue when within a frameset page where loading a new page in one of the frames sometimes does not get the complete page but cuts off part of it when the retrieved source is viewed. This usually results in a blank frame however refreshing that particular frame will retrieve it properly.
Unfortunately I can't give you an example of this because of the firewall. (This is an intranet server).
What I want to know is. Is this an issue with the FIN_WAIT signal, an issue with Packet size and Timeouts, an issue with the Browser or something else entirely?
>How-To-Repeat:
Because this is an intranet server within a firewall I can't give you a URL for the offending pages (More than one) where this is happening.
I can suggest using the environment quoted above and trying to load a non cached frames page and then changing the contents of one of the frames

State-Changed-Why:
There's really not much we can do except give you another
hint -- try using tcpdump.  You want to dump the packets to see
that the server is sending everything to the client.  good luck.
If you find a repeatable case, then maybe we can look at it more...

 It seems to indeed be a problem with incomplete packets. In particular
 something called TCP slow start. This is where when an initial connection is
 made between client and server the number of packets sent at once is slowly
 built up. This is where I ran into problems with my little Solaris server on
 the very large BBC WAN (Probably the largest single Network in the world
 with up to 50,000 devices connected to it). The default network set up for a
 Solaris 2.6 box is for a small LAN of about 10 units. Basically I had to do
 a little "ndd" tweaking of the device drivers in particular "ndd -set
 /dev/tcp tcp_slow_start_initial 2" to increase the number of initial packets
 sent out as there is an packet ACK problem in windows 95/IE 3.01 with HTTP
 1.0 protocols.
 It seems to have cured most of the problem.
