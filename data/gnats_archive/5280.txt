Although the problem is probably not dependent on any of these
>Description:
if I 

  ``place the Apache core code (all the stuff which usually forms the httpd
  binary) into a DSO libhttpd.so, an executable program libhttpd.ep
  and a bootstrapping executable program httpd''

with

  $ ./configure --prefix=</path/to/install> --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE ...

, I get an executable, with the path to libhttpd.ep being hardcoded to
</path/to/install>/lib/.  

This is highly undesirable, because it makes it impossible to build
relocatable [e.g.] binary RPM packages for such an apache.  

>How-To-Repeat:
$ ./configure --prefix=</path/to/install> --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE ...
$ make
$ make install root=</tmp/apache.install_root>
$ mv /tmp/apache.install_root /tmp/apache.work_root
$ /tmp/apache.work_root/usr/sbin/httpd -f <your_config_file>
>Fix:
The problem might be solved, if we used the same strategies to find 
libhttpd.ep as are used to find any lib*.so /*searching through
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ...*/. 

A related question is: "if ``libhttpd.ep'' contains anything, which is 
obviously reused outside apache itself, why then isn't it a DSO like any 
other on my system?"
