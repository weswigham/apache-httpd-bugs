>Environment:
NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5.  Visual C++ 5.0 compiler for mod_ssl.
>Description:
Our Win32 Apache server will just hang on all requests after running with 
mod_ssl for a while (less than 30 minutes).  Everything seems to run fine 
for the first few SSL requests and then it just stops.  It runs fine without 
mod_ssl installed, though.  Has anyone got SSL working with Win32 Apache?
We were using a real secure certificate from Verisign, by the way.  I would 
ask the mod_ssl people, but I think it's a problem with Win32 Apache.  We 
used the instructions for configuring mod_ssl for Windows.
