Linux ftp.4u.nl 2.0.30 #1 Tue Apr 22 10:49:45 EDT 1997 i586 unknown
RedHat Linux 4.2 running on a AMD 6x86-233 with 64MB memory, 2.1 GB HDD.
No patches, no kernel updates, Apache has run successfully before.
All at install-time available compilers installed (cc, gcc, etc)
>Description:
I installed Apache 1.3.2, changed the DocumentRoot to /www and did
/usr/local/apache/apachectl restart. When I look at my page (http://ftp.4u.nl)
it returns with this Forbidden-page:
-
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.

Apache/1.3.2 Server at ftp.4u.nl Port 80)
-
The "/usr/local/apache/apachectl fullstats"-command returns the same text.

I deleted Apache, re-installed it with no modifications to the .conf-files, same result
I modified the .conf-files to fit my locales (servername, admin email, documentroot etc), same result
I compiled Apache with the -DBIG_SECURITY_HOLE (or something) flag, ran apache as root, same result

What am I doing wrong?
