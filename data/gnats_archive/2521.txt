>Description:
I cant find the file to download the win32 binary distrubution of Apache. Can anyone give me a full address to the file. Has the Win32 distrubution been temporally been taken of line ? or am I just looking and not seeing ?

According to the documentation a need nothing else other than my Windows machine to install a binary version of Apache. This would seem to rule out the possibility of the file I am after being in another directory that at first glance does not have a name that is directly connected to Windows.

http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries/
Look no win32 directory.
>Fix:
Make a win32 directory
