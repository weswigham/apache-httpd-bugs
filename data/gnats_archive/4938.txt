>Description:
I guess this is an enhancement request.  The background for the InstallShield
install screen shows text, tiled, but there's no characteristic feather image
tiled with the text.  Considering that you don't have a lot of choice about
the somewhat politically incorrect name Apache, you might as well keep on
using the feather; it's all over your web site, anyway.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add the feather;-)
