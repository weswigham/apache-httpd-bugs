>Description:
Given the directory structure

/dir/index.html
/part/index.html
/part.html

With a default configuration, the uri's
/dir/, /dir, /part/, /part, and /part.html are handled correctly.

With MultiViews on, I think that the Right Thing is for /part to
be equivalent to /part.html, not /part/ (/dir is still equivalent to
/dir/, because there isn't a dir.*)

[ mod_speling may be induced to do this in this specific case, but add an
*.html.en and a *.html.de for each *.html there, and the point remains ]
Is my idea of the Right Thing, the Wrong Thing?

>How-To-Repeat:
Create the directories dir and part, and the files dir/index.html,
part/index.html and part.html
Set DirectoryIndex to index.html (or index) and turn MultiViews on.
Then issue the requests

GET /dir
GET /dir/
GET /part.html
GET /part/
GET /part

I think the last redirection shouldn't be the same as the first one.

>Fix:
What I suggest is to change the MultiViews documentation from:

A MultiViews search is enabled by the MultiViews Option. If the server
receives a request for /some/dir/foo and /some/dir/foo does not exist,
then the server reads the directory looking for all files named foo.*,
and effectively fakes up a type map which names all those files, assigning
them the same media types and content-encodings it would have if the
client had asked for one of them by name. It then chooses the best match
to the client's requirements, and returns that document.

directory, it redirects to /some/dir/foo/.

and to change the code in mod_negotiation.c accordingly:

diff -C3 mod_negotiation-old.c mod_negotiation.c
