HP 9000 / 811 running hpux 10.10
>Description:
I am trying to run the binary of apache 1.2.0 for hpux 10.20 on
a system running hpux 10.10. 

I found a file httpd-hppa1.1-hp-hpux (299985) in the src directory and changed its
name to httpd.

On starting  ./httpd -f /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
the following message is returned :

/usr/lib/dld.sl: Invalid version for shared library:/usr/lib/libc.1
/usr/lib /dld.sl: Exec format error
Abort (core dump)

How can I overcome this problem ? 
I would n't have thought there would be much difference between hp 10.10 & hpux
10.20 ?
p.s I do not have the ansi C compiler for hpux and dbx so cannot provide a stack trace of
the core.

Cheers

State-Changed-Why:
This is really not an Apache problem.  You're taking
an application built on and for one version of the
operating system, and trying to get it to run on an
earlier version.  There's not much we can do about
that.

What you *can* do is: get a friend to build the server
on the version of the OS you have; or find someone with
lots of HP-UX experience who can help you work around
the library mismatch issue; or you can get gcc 2.7.2,
install it on your system, and build the server yourself
for your environment.

Of the three, I would recommend the last.

Thanks for [trying to use] Apache!
