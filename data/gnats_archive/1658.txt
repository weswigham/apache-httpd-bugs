>Description:
Apache 1.3b3 on NT Server 4.0.  Using the binaries I installed Apache to
C:\Apache. I tried to start without any luck.  The configuration files are
OK, or at least appeared alright.  I went into DOS to see any messages on
startup, changed dir to C:\Apache and typed 'apache -s'.  What I got was:
'unable to gethostname: no errors'

What is wrong?

Do you get any other errors?  Anything in the error_log?

Did you try setting a ServerName directive in your config
file to the appropriate hostname?

 What would the appropriate 'hostname' be?  The computer name?
 Thanks in advance?

 Sorry to bother you guys but this works.  I reinstalled Apache
 & it works.  We used loaclhost as the hostname.  It didn't work
 before but does now.  I don't know.  Maybe the install didn't go
 well the first time.  Thanks again.

Submitter reinstalled and it worked... who knows, NT can
be very odd.
