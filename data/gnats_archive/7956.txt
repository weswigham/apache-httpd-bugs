RedHat 7.x
>Description:
After compiling and installing, after starting apache with ./apachectl start,
apache can't start. When I look at the log, I get the following error :

[Fri Jun 29 03:03:58 2001] 
[error] (22)Invalid argument: shmctl() could not set segment #5462028

I am lost !
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't exactly know if this is specific to Linux, to my config....
>Fix:
I have no idea. I have found a LOT of people with this error, I tried to find the
solution but I didn't find anything on the subject. I tried Google, Usenet...
NOTHING !
Thanks for your help.
