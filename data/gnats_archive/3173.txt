<snip>

/usr/home/deicide/bluesnews/admin/.htaccess: Invalid command 'Auth_MYSQLdatabase', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration



Disregard the error itself - pay attention to that full path of .htaccess is shown.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an intentional 500 Error by creating a .htaccess file with random garbage in it.
>Fix:
Probably no file information should be show at all.
