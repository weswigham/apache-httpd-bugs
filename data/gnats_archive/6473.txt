>Description:
I found the function in main/buff.c .
ap_bopenf() has parameter (apr_pool_t *a, const char *name, int flg, int mode).
But it doesn't use 'mode' when open file.
here is code...

rv = apr_open(&file, name, flg, 0, a);

so, whenever the file is created, the file has invalid mode such as '0000'.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can note function in apache/src/main/buff.c
>Fix:
--- before modify ---
rv = apr_open(&file, name, flg, 0, a);
--- after modify ---
rv = apr_open(&file, name, flg, mode, a);

State-Changed-When: Sun Sep 10 14:11:51 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
This problem has been solved by removing the bopenf function
from Apache.  This function had begun to cause problems since
removing IOLs from Apache 2.0.

Thank you for the bug report.
