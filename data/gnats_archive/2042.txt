>Description:
In the FAQ:
Note that in version 1.3, all CGI scripts will be unbuffered so the only difference between nph scripts and normal scripts is that nph scripts require the full HTTP headers to be sent. 

But when i try this
index.shtml:
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
<!--#exec cmd="cgi-bin/test.cgi" -->
</pre>
</body>
</html>

text.cgi:
#!/bin/sh
date
sleep 2
date
sleep 2
date
sleep 2
date
sleep 2     

The result is send to the browser when the whole script is ready
I thought every output is send  unbuffered ?

Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
That probably has something to do with the fact that #exec cmd
isn't a CGI.  Use #include virtual, or #exec cgi for example.
