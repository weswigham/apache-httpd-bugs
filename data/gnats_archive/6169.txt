Linux galileo.codehost.com 2.2.14-5.0smp #1 SMP Tue Mar 7 21:01:40 EST 2000 i686 unknown
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
libc-2.1.3
>Description:
When i go to a URL that has a .htaccess in it, it used to popup the login window when i was running 1.3.9. I successfully compiled and installed 1.3.12 over 1.3.9 and now the popup window does not popup. so I cannot authenticat.
here is a copy of the .htaccess:
##############
AuthType Basic
AuthName "CodeHost.com's Members Area!"
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/conf/passwd
require valid-user
##############
Like i stated, this worked in 1.3.9.... I know I am over looking something, and
it's probably simple.
the access and error logs dont spit out anything unsual
