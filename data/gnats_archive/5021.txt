>Description:
we missed the possibility to maintain the apache with the apachectl,
i.e for 'restart' if we use different configfiles.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I modified the apachectl-script so it  recognizes if 'HTTPD_CONF' is set in the environment. In this case, the httpd is invoced with the '-f' option. Now it works even with 'configtest' and 'restart'.

Here's the diff, I still hope, this will be helpfull for some othe users,

best regards
