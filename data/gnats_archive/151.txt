>Description:
Unable to get apache to return anything other than "an error occured"
when attempting to #if/#elif based on the DOCUMENT_URI.  I've tried
1, 2, and 3 backslashes in front of a /, but no dice.
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm doing test work at http://www.antir.sca.org/~krenn/ssi/.  Note
that I've redefined .html to be server-parsed as well - we're using
SSI's everywhere for backgrounds, etc.

State-Changed-Why:
have you tried something in the form of:
    <!--#if expr="\"$DOCUMENT_URI\" = \"/dir\""-->

It gets annoyed if there are any unquoted '/'s in the 
expression.  If that does not help, please send a sample
document that you are having problems with.
