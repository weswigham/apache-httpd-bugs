>Description:
I have been fumbling around trying to work out why our apache server 
stopped working - I tracked it down to this:

In jserv.properties, the server starts fine if:
#security.challengeSize=5
is included, but refuses to start if this commented out line is removed. (it logs
a startup error for all protocols in the mod_jserv log)
Peculiar!
