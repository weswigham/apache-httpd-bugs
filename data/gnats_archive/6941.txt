>Description:
after unpacking apache_1_3_14_win32_r2.exe, and installing with command:

apache -i -n apache

start with command:

apache -k start

so far no problem.... but when using any of the following:

apache -k restart
apache -k shutdown
apache -k stop

the following message is obtained:

Cannot read apache PID file c:/apache/logs/httpd.pid

on looking for this file, it does not exist.

I tried copying this file from another machine, and was consequently greeted with the following (after the restart command):

[emerg] (2) the system cannot find the file specified:
OpenEvent on ap704_restart event

why is this file not being installed?  what can i do about it???
