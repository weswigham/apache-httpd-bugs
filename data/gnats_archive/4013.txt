>Release:        1.3.4
>Environment:
PII 233 ,Win95 OSR, Apache 1.3.4 for Win32
>Description:
while I add a alias such as 
  Alias /download/ "d:/backup/download/"
 while the directory includes sub-directory a,b,c and a  sub-directory
named in Chinese Character.
     while I click the dir name (Chinese Character) in dir list, the apache server  returns error 403 forbidden....;when I click sub-dir "a", or "b", the server returns the result very successfully.
     I have tested that if using the apache 1.3.4 for unix-like system,this error will not occur. can you tell me why?
>How-To-Repeat:
sorry, you can not access my computer for I am in a intranet.
>Fix:
   maybe there is something wrong while handling  2-byte characters 
such as Chinese and other  language not English.
