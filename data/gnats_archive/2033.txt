If you set a variable in the "parent" document any following included documents
cannot see this variable.  This is the reverse situation of the problem 
reported in PR 1928.

<http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1928>
>How-To-Repeat:
Parent document
<!--#set var="Title" value="Apache RTFM!" -->
<!--#include file="rtfm_header.html" -->
.
.
.
-------------rtfm_header.html-------------------
<html>
<head>
<title>
<!--#echo var="Title"-->
</title>
.
.
.
>Fix:
Sorry I don't have any suggestions, as I have not started to work with the
src code tree yet

 This should be fixed in 1.3b5.  But I see nobody has bothered to create a
 windows executable yet.

 It was a mistake on my part to report this bug.  About 24 hours
 later, I realised what was wrong.  The "subsequent" files were
 .html and not parsed. 
 <I'm a fool>
 Once I realised this was the problem
 and changed the <!--#include files to .shtml so they were
 parsed, the "problem" went away.
 
 Sorry for any inconvience caused
