Compiled on:

SunOS build1.ofc1.va.gemnets.com 5.6 Generic_105181-22 sun4u sparc SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine

Bug discovered on:

SunOS cust-web1.dc1.va.bbops.net 5.8 Generic_108528-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60

gcc version 2.95.2
>Description:
Config excerpt:

<VirtualHost 66.18.15.110:8001>

LoadModule jk_module /dist/pkg/jakarta-tomcat/3.2/lib/mod_jk.so
JkWorkersFile /local/service/jakarta-tomcat/3.2/tomcat/conf/workers.properties
JkLogFile /local/service/jakarta-tomcat/3.2/tomcat/logs/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel error

[...]

Running httpd -t on this config file results in a segmentation fault. I don't
have gdb available tonight, but the core file is saved, and I can provide full
backtraces if requested.

This configuration is indeed most likely completely bogus, but I would much
rather see Apache throw an error in this condition than segfault mysteriously. :)

Full configuration file available as well, if necessary.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I reported this problem to Manoj via *cough* IRC, and he implemented a fix in
his local copy, but requested that I submit this bug report for formal
documentation of the problem.

Thanks for the report.
