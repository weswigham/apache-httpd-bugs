>Description:
3 Suggestion

1. Please add an option to automatically save a logfile all X minutes to disk.
2. Please add an option to save the logfile with month and date. e.g. access03-2000.log. Would help a lot of people, I think.
3. Please add an option to make it impossible for the surfer to see any directory structure. Using the option IndexIgnore *.* at the moment.

Just add.

State-Changed-Why:

Please do not put multiple different change requests into
one request.

According to points 1 and 2, there are a few third party
tools for this job. It is very unlikely that we will
ever add such a feature to Apache itself.
