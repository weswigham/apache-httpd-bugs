>Description:
when the directive RLimitNPROC is used inside of a virtual host
configuration, like 
RLimitNPROC #5 #10
Apache 1.2b7 core dumps and refuses to start.

RLimitCPU RLimitMEM do seem to have such ill effect.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well, if it core dumps, no one can see the URL :(
>Fix:
I haven't figured out yet.  Will try

State-Changed-Why:
The RLimitNPROC directive takes one or two arguments.
Each is either a number OR a keyword.  In neither syntax
should you include the octothorpe ('#') character.  Try
changing your line from
  RLimitNPROC #5 #10
to
  RLimitNPROC 5 10
and see if the server processes it correctly.  Please
let us know the results.
