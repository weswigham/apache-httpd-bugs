FreeBSD -current cvsup'd 06/16/98
gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
When I tried to start httpd, I would get the following error:
[Wed Jun 17 05:06:14 1998] [emerg] (2)No such file or directory: Parent cannot o
pen lock file:

Then the program terminated.

I traced the problem to a boundary condition when creating the string for the name of the lock file "/var/run/httpd.lock.18254".  Instead of creating the name, a 0 byte string was returned.  This was a result of the ap_vformatter going past the end of the current vbuff.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure.  I modified my httpd.conf file to have a "recoverable" bug.  I gave a VirtualHost 2 copies of the same address.  This causes a log message which allocates a block in the pool then everything is fine.
>Fix:
Check the return value form the expand_lock_fname to verify a valid string has been returned.  Retry if it failed.

 _PLEASE_ do not report bugs in old betas.  Please take a few minutes and
 upgrade to the latest version (especially when it is a non-beta, ie.
 1.3.0) and see if the problem is still there.  Many bugs are fixed, so not
 checking just adds extra PRs.
 
 I think this was fixed in 1.3.0, but you should try it.

 I'm sorry, I thought this was the newest beta, I have not had it for very
 long.  I will try to be more careful next time 8).
