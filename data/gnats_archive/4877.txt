>Description:

# define an alias
servlet.alias1.code=com.mycompany.servlet.ServletClass1

# define init. args
servlet.alias1.initArgs=param1=abc

=> problem: if the servlet is loaded using its fully-qualified class name
            (com.mycompany.servlet.ServletClass1), it fails to get the 
            init. arguments.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The servlet engine should keep an mapping table for aliases and the
corresponding fully-qualified class names.

I'll forward this to the developers mailing list to check wether
this is a real bug, or it's somehow defined in the specs...
