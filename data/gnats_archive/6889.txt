This bug seems to be the same than number #6792.

When using a script called "foo.php3" for uploading a file on a web server,
if this script calls itself for parsing the uploaded file, httpd has SEGV.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x4024ecbd in XS_Apache__URI_password () from /etc/httpd.other/modules/libperl.so
(gdb) where
#0  0x4024ecbd in XS_Apache__URI_password () from /etc/httpd.other/modules/libperl.so
#1  0x402a2008 in Perl_pp_dbmopen () from /etc/httpd.other/modules/libperl.so

#3  0x4025170e in XS_Apache__File_new () from /etc/httpd.other/modules/libperl.so
[...]

When using it from a .html page "test_segv.html" to a .php3 script "test_segv.php3" (same name, but different extensions), 
a SEGV occurs :

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0 in ?? ()
(gdb) where
#0  0x0 in ?? ()
#1  0x40225d20 in ?? () from /etc/httpd.other/modules/libperl.so

#6  0x402747e4 in study_chunk () from /etc/httpd.other/modules/libperl.so



When calling it with a CGI, and without setting php3 on, a broken pipe appears :
rogram received signal SIGPIPE, Broken pipe.
0x40146af4 in __libc_write () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) where
#0  0x40146af4 in __libc_write () from /lib/libc.so.6

#4  0x8051d53 in ap_bspawn_child ()
#5  0x805278b in ap_bfilbuf ()
>How-To-Repeat:
Use this script, put it in a file called "test_segv.php3" :
<HTML>
<BODY>
 <FORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="test_segv.php3" METHOD=POST>
  <INPUT NAME="order_file" TYPE="file"> 
  <INPUT NAME="DOWNLOAD" TYPE="submit" VALUE="Télécharger les ordres">
 </FORM>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Try to launch it, when you call it for the upload, httpd SEGV.
I've tried it with a .php3 and a .cgi. Using .cgi has a differenc behaviour,
httpd has broken pipe.
>Fix:
Don't use a re-entrant script, use two differents scripts

State-Changed-Why:

I am confused by your problem.  You say that the
problem is with PHP, yet the segfault seems to
be in mod_perl.  In addition, many millions of
people use CGI scripts that call themselves, so
I am fairly certain that this is not the problem.

Can you recreate this problem with a CGI
on a server that includes
only standard Apache modules (no PHP or mod_perl)?
If you can, can you describe exactly what happens
in more detail?
Thanks.
