Linux 6.0
>Description:
I am attepting to access the public_html directory in the user directory /home
My access.conf file currently has
<Directory />
AllowOverride None
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Options None
</Directory>

<Directory /home/*/public_html>
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

This should allow me to access my web site http://IP.Address/~user
But I am getting a 403 Forbidden web page with the error message 
"Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /~jeremy on this server. "

My UserDir is set to public_html.

I got my information on how to configure the access.conf from the Linux System 
Administration Handbook, Komarinski, Collett, page 207 and from the UserDir
documentation file that came with Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://192.168.1.12
>Fix:
I believe that it is a problem with the permission, but that is it.
