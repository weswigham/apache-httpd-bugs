>Description:

I'm reading some apache mailing lists from a read-only mail-to-news
gateway, and it is showing up a persistent problem with qmail in the
bugdb list. The mail-to-news software tries to post a message with
headers like this:

-  Subject: blah blah blah
-  Sender: apache-bugdb-owner@apache.org
-  X-Send-Pr-Version: 3.2
-  To: apbugs@hyperreal.org
-  From: someone
-  X-Original-Date: 28 Oct 1998 08:41:28 -0000
-  X-Original-Message-Id: <19981028084128.2756.qmail@hyperreal.org>
-  Return-path: <apache-bugdb-owner-list-a_apache.bugdb=chiark.greenend.org.uk@apache.org>
-  X-Received: from taz.hyperreal.org (hyperreal.org) [209.133.83.16]
-          by chiark.greenend.org.uk with smtp (Exim 2.02 #1)
-          id 0zYRIy-0007fG-00 (Debian); Wed, 28 Oct 1998 08:50:12 +0000
-  X-Received: (qmail 5328 invoked by uid 6000); 28 Oct 1998 08:50:11 -0000
-  X-Received: (qmail 5098 invoked by uid 2001); 28 Oct 1998 08:50:00 -0000
-  X-Received:(qmail 2757 invoked by uid 2012); 28 Oct 1998 08:41:28 -0000

-  Precedence: bulk
-  Message-ID: <m2n.0zYRIz-000C0h@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

and the news server complains about the last X-Received: line not
having a space after the colon.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure it isn't just your mail to news software messing
up?  Can you show the headers of an unmunged message that
show a "Recieved:(" header?  I don't see such headers.
