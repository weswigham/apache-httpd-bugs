Indy and O2
Version 7.1 of the SGI compilers
>Description:
In the previous versions of Apache (1.3.0) one received a line apparently
to stderr that httpd was runing with suexec, this message (a very comforting
one) no longer seems to exist even though I believe suexec is running....
there are entries in the logs/cgi.log file each time a cgi is run. The 
online documentation for suexec seems out of date.

The question: what's the correct way to now determine that suexec is being used.

State-Changed-Why:
(This has already been reported and the answer is in the
bugdb.)

The previous stderr message was interfering with inetd
mode operation, and so a modified version of the message is
now emitted to the ErrorLog file instead.

 I realise from both the CHANGES file in the src tree and the previous
 report in bugdb that the message should go to the error log file....
 indeed the error log was the first place I looked for the information.
 
 To reiterate
 - I'm assuming suexec is working because
   1. I've been using it in the past and just updated from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1
   2. correct looking messages are being written to cgi.log
      eg:
        [1998-08-02 19:45:10]: uid: (sweetie/sweetie) gid: (user/user) cmd:
 listadd.cgi
        [1998-08-02 19:45:42]: uid: (maverick/maverick) gid: (user/user)
 cmd: logit.cgi
 - There was nothing written to the error log except the normal startup
   message, eg:
      [Sun Aug  2 19:43:06 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.1 (Unix)
      configured -- resuming normal operations

Comment-Added:
Yeah, you're right. There was a bug. The suEXEC
message has to be of "notice" level because this
level is treated differently for startup messages.
Fixed for Apache 1.3.2
