Windows NT Server 4.0 - SP3
>Description:
Cookies no passed while execing a Perl script (follows):
-------------< start script >-------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
$output = 
qq~Set-Cookie: test=Ohmygod; expires=Fri, 31-Dec-1999 00:00:00 GMT; path=/ domain=warp.psi.br

Content-type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">
<HTML><BODY>
$ENV{'HTTP_COOKIE'}
</BODY></HTML>
~;
print $output;
---------------< end script >---------------

The output gathered from Apache (telnet://localhost:80) was the following:
---------------< start output >---------------
Content-type: text/html
 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">
<HTML><BODY>
 
</BODY></HTML>
---------------< end output >---------------

From the simplicity of what is described above, I guess you can pretty much tell that the Set-Cookie header is getting gobbled up somewhere along the way.
>How-To-Repeat:
yes, just run the script above mentioned on your own NT box.
>Fix:
nope... I'm just the guy using Apache! :o)

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
