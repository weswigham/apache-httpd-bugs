>Environment:
Apache 1.3.9 (and 1.3.6, and possibly earlier) any operating system
>Description:
The Perl script shipped as src/support/dbmmanage appears to run
successfully even when it fails to open the DBM file on which
it's invoked (e.g. because the file isn't readable, or because
the file doesn't exist and the relevant directory doesn't exist
or isn't writable).

The problem is that line 94 of the script shipped as
src/support/dbmmanage says:

  tie %DB, "AnyDBM_File", $file, $flags, $mode || die "Can't tie $file: $!";

Because of the relative precedence of "||", this is equivalent to

  tie %DB, "AnyDBM_File", $file, $flags, ($mode || die "Can't tie $file: $!");

so the "die()" is not invoked even if the "tie()" fails.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try running

    dbmmanage <dir>/<file> add foo bar

where "<dir>" is a nonexistent directory and "<file>"
is any file name. dbmmanage outputs:

    User foo added with password encrypted to bar

but doesn't actually change anything.

Or try running dbmmanage on a non-writable DBM file.
>Fix:
Change line 94 of "dbmmanage" to:

  tie (%DB, "AnyDBM_File", $file, $flags, $mode) || die "Can't tie $file: $!";

or

  tie %DB, "AnyDBM_File", $file, $flags, $mode
    or die "Can't tie $file: $!";

 Thanks for catching this subtle bug.
 It's now fixed for Apache 1.3.10.
