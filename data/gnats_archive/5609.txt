Debian Linux 
Linux version 2.2.12 (gcc version 2.95.2 19991109 (Debian GNU/Linux)) #3 SMP
Debian Standard Dist of Apache 1.3.9
>Description:
A VirtualHost directive, similar to that shown below, had a typo (note "ackinworld" 3rd line from bottom.)  Apache ran for from five to fifteen before dying without any error messages.
Attempts to restart Apache were unsuccessful, but left no error message.  Commenting out the offending entry solved the problem, which recurred in similar fashion when the entry was uncommented (I.E. five to fifteen minutes of operation before a mysterious shutdown.  At the time we had not noticed the typo)

a configtest directive returned "Syntax OK"

#<VirtualHost webfarm:80>
#        ServerAdmin admin@troma.com
#        DocumentRoot /home/joinpage/public_html/fractalcow/
#        Servername join.fractalcow.com
#        TransferLog /home/joinpage/logs/transfer.log
#        ErrorLog /home/joinpage/logs/error.log
#        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/home/joinpage/cgi-bin/"
#       <Directory /home/joinpage/public_html/ackinworld/ >
#               DirectoryIndex signup.htm
#       </Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
#<VirtualHost webfarm:80>
#        ServerAdmin admin@troma.com
#        DocumentRoot /home/joinpage/public_html/fractalcow/
#        Servername join.fractalcow.com
#        TransferLog /home/joinpage/logs/transfer.log
#        ErrorLog /home/joinpage/logs/error.log
#        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/home/joinpage/cgi-bin/"
#       <Directory /home/joinpage/public_html/ackinworld/ >
#               DirectoryIndex signup.htm
#       </Directory>
