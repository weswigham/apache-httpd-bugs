>Environment:
Windows NT - precompiled binaries
>Description:
I believe that many people using Windows NT would have much easier time (and would fall in love with Apache sooner) if the installation, documentation and sample configuration would show how to avoid the most common problems.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Almost everyone on Windows NT will run into these problems:

1) The directive setting 'ScriptInterpreterSource registry' is almost always needed, yet this directive is neither mentioned in default httpd.conf, nor in the 'htdocs\manual\windows.html' page.

It takes quite some time for the newcomer to Apache to discover what is wrong with CGI programs not using sheebang.

2) I understand that there are reasons for CGI scripts not to inherit automatically all environmental vars from the server.  However, the variables that are inherited by default almost never enough.

Ideally, there should be a note in the windows.html document and in the default httpf.conf how to pass on other vars.

For example, things like CLASSPATH, TEMP, TMP will be needed by almost everyone.

State-Changed-Why:

Agreed.  The ScriptInterpreterSource notes are added to the
httpd.conf file.

As for env vars... those issues (amoung others) should be
documented, so I'm tagging the report to come back to it
when the mod_cgi/win32 docs are created.
