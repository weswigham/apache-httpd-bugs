>Description:

*) <Directory ~ PATH> was silently ignored.
*) <Directory ~> should cause syntax error, but it didn't.
*) <Directory >  should cause syntax error, but it didn't.

<DirectoryMatch PATH> still works.

I don't quite make out the reason, but <Directory ~> was nullified
in server/core.c 1.47->1.48 bigpatch.

server/core.c:dirsection() checks for existence after "~" as

	cmd->path = ap_getword_conf(cmd->pool, &arg);
	if (!cmd->path) 
		return "<Directory ~ > block must specify a path"

but ap_getword_conf() NEVER returns NULL, so the predicate is always true,
failing to detect missing PATH.

If there was a PATH, it should compile it by
	r = ap_pregcomp(cmd->pool, cmd->path ....)
but mysteriously this line got missing after version 1.48.

We may have to check every locations comparing ap_getword_conf() return
to NULL to get rid of similar bugs lying around.

>How-To-Repeat:

1) Syntax check (by "httpd -t") with configuration
	<Directory >

2) Syntax check (by "httpd -t") with configuration
	<Directory ~>

3) Swap any <DirectoryMatch ...> with <Directory ~ ...>
   and see if it's still in use.
