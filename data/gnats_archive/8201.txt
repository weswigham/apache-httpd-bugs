 Thanks for the pointer.
 
 I see from that PR, and from the documented algorithm for language
 selection that the real problem is LanguagePriority is not really
 properly documented anywhere (everywhere it is documented is either
 misleading, incorrect, or incomplete), and the limitations of the
 current implementation are not even mentioned in the current release
 notes.
 
 I suspect the correct work-around for almost everyone is to simply never
 use LanguagePriority, but if you do to always be very very careful to
 create its list of languages from exactly the list of current
 "AddLanguage" settings.
 
 This seems especially important since the documented claim that it has
 no effect for correct HTTP/1.1 requests is clearly false.
