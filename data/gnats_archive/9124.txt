>Description:
The --prefix and --enable-layout options to configure are not being
properly used.

Neither --enable-layout nor the older --with-layout seem to have any effect
the paths, though configure happily accepts either.

The --prefix *is* used for "make install", but the paths compiled into
httpd still point to the default /usr/local/apache2 prefix.
>How-To-Repeat:
configure --enable-layout=OpenBSD; make install

or

configure --prefix=/var/tmp/foo; make install; /var/tmp/foo/bin/httpd
