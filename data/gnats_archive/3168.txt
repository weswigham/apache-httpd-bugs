>Release:        1.3.1
>Environment:
Operating System: NT (Server Release, Service Pack 3)
Compiler: MS-VC 5.0
CGI-Program in ANSI-C iwth MS-VC 5.0
>Description:
CGI scripts with errors (scripts that do not end) started from the server 
cannot be stopped. Even after the Apache NT service is stopped and restarted
those processes remain visible in the taks manager and cannot be stopped.
If you try you get the error access denied, although you are administrator.
This behavious is independent of whether the Apache is running or not. 

This leads to a shortage of memory, once you cannot guarantee that all CGI
scripts never hang.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a simple CGI script in Ansi-C with Microsoft VC V5.0 that produces an 
endless loop and try to remove this from the task list on the NT server.
>Fix:
Do a timeout or provide a utility to remove them or better yet, when the
Apache is stopped it simply closes down all CGI-Processes

State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: stoddard
State-Changed-When: Tue May 25 08:16:49 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Need to update Apache on Win32 to use named pipes, which 
will allow us to do non-blocking (async) I/O to CGI 
scripts. This will allow us to kill errant CGI scripts if they don't respond in a reasonable amount of time.
