>Environment:
Win95.  Apache 1.3b3 binary distribution
>Description:
On Win95 perl for win 32 with the latest perl version 5.003_07 Build 315.  When
running a script from the command line, it runs fine.  When running thru the
Windows95 ported Apache 1.3b3, the new lines in the script \n do not give new
line feeds.  I have tried \r\n  and \n\n and it still will not give any line
feeds when displayed on the browser.
>How-To-Repeat:
Hello World! Hello World! Hello World! Hello World! 
That is the results of the following script when run thru Apache 1.3b3:
#!c:\perl\bin\perl.exe
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello World!\n";
print "Hello World!\n\n";
print "Hello World!\n\n\n";
print "Hello World!\r\n";

As you see, there are NO line feeds given returned in the browser.  When run
from a shell, it runs correctly.

State-Changed-Why:
The problem is that you've labeled the output as HTML,
and the browser is gobbling the newlines.  As it should.
Change your "text/html" to "text/plain" and you'll see the
behaviour you expect.

Thank you for taking the time to report this, and for using
Apache!
