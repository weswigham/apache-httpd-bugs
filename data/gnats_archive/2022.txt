Linux 2.0.30
Hybrid Apache 1.2.6, I use suEXEC and rotatelogs from the 1.3 tree
>Description:
If suEXEC's log file is only writable by root, the error message from execv()
fails (permission denied) causing errors to go to Apache's error log.
>How-To-Repeat:
touch /var/log/cgi.log
chmod 0600 /var/log/cgi.log
cp /tmp/apache/cgi-bin/printenv ~mine/www/printenv.cgi
chmod 0 ~mine/www/printenv.cgi
lynx http://localhost/~mine/printenv.cgi
>Fix:
Preferred: recapture root privilege before logging the error
Acceptable: die with a better message in Apache's error log
OK, I guess: silently die and let the site maintainer puzzle it out
