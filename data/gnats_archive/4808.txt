>Description:
This may seem dumb, but I just spent over an hour trying to remember how to add
an user to server.  I had not added on to this particualr server in over a year.

I wsa trying to use dbmmange, and the issue was that mod_auth expected me to
use htpasswd.

No where was that mentioned, a bolt of lightning hit me and I remembered it.
