>Description:
I have redirect all request for our Counter.cgi to a new server
using following directive in srm.conf

Redirect /cgi-bin http://counter.ksc.co.th/cgi-bin

Old server is mail.ksc.co.th. It seem that apache does not redirect
request properly as I point my browser to

http://mail.ksc.net.th/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=cybstar.dat|dd=C

and get odd result. I've check access_log on counter.ksc.co.th and get
following log for this query.

proxy.ksc.net.th - - [01/Apr/1997:13:10:56 -0700] "GET /cgi-bin/Count.cgi HTTP/1.0" 200 476
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I think it should be

proxy.ksc.net.th - - [01/Apr/1997:13:10:56 -0700] "GET /cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=cybstar.dat|dd=C HTTP/1.0" 200 476

Is this a bug in apache mod_alias module?
