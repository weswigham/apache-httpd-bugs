>Description:
When using apache 1.3b2 on Windows Nt there is a problem in the proxy modul as 
well as in the access control modul looking for the htaccess file.

The bug #1315 can be surroundet by doing a fix in directory main module util.c.
there the filename / Path includes ":" . this is forbidden in NT. therefore we added a loop, changing all ":" accept the first one from the drive letter to "_".
in the conf file we also changed then ".htaccess" to "htaccess"
nevertheless the same problem occurs when apache generated the cachfilenames/ Pathnames. here also ":" are used eg. "proxy:http:" . As i can't find aout where the variable are used on other places , i wasn't able to fix that problem.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I found that the tricky part is that in the proxy-modules (and related) the url and the constant "proxy:" is used with different meanings - also the variabl "scheme". I think the problem can be surrounded if the author of the modules - only he knows the dependencies - could add a little function which converts the komplete url to an OS specific full qualified filename (for Nt with driveletter ...)

This has been resolved another way in the current

as filenames.
