State-Changed-Why:
Hmm, if you can supply a patch which makes the decision at
compile time... then maybe we'll remove it.  But when you
say "rollup #foo" I get really worried about turning it
off as default.  It's only been about 3 years since SGI
has known of the problem, nice of them to finally decide
to fix it.  I think we can wait another year for some more
folks to start running the fixed code before we change the
default.
