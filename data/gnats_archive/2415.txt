>Description:
here is a part of my httd.conf:
NameVirtualHost 157.159.41.109
<VirtualHost 157.159.41.109>
ServerName angus.minet.net
DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs/
Alias /php              /mnt/export4/php/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 157.159.41.109>
DocumentRoot /mnt/export3/dindinx/starwars/
ServerName sw.minet.net
</VirtualHost>

When i go to http://sw.minet.net/server-info?mod_alias.c
I have this :
Current Configuration: 
httpd.conf 
    Alias /php /mnt/export4/php/

but this alias is for angus.minet.net and not for sw.minet.net

So, it's a very very minor bug, i just wanted to let you know...

State-Changed-Why:
This is more of a design flaw than a bug; it's not as
simple as that because some things are inherited by
vhosts from the default server config, and some things
aren't.  I thought we had a report of it already, but
I can't find it now - so I'm marking this as suspended so
it can be investigated in the next coding cycle.  Thanks
for the report!

 Actually everything is fine if people would just stop using the "main
 server"... the mistake is in not requiring people to use _default_ hosts.
