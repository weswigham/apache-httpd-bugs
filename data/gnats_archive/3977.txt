uname -a: SunOS lsesun14 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.6/2.8.1/specs
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
I tried to build Apache with some extra modules, not included by default.
A call to 'ar' failed, because the Global Offset Table used by
Position Independent Code was full. See the explanation of the compiler
switches -fpic and -fPIC in the gcc documentation, e.g. at
http://castor.epfl.ch/asis/GNU.LANG/gcc-2.8.1/gcc_2.html#SEC19 .
  
>How-To-Repeat:
config.status:

./configure \
"--with-layout=GNU" \
"--prefix=/users/wwwtemp/Tools/apache" \
"--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE" \
"--enable-module=so" \
"--enable-module=proxy" \
"--enable-module=rewrite" \
"$@"

>Fix:
I modified the configure script to have the compiler switch -fPIC
instead of -fPIC. Either -fPIC should be the default for
the sparc-solaris architecture (and possibly others), or there should
be a configure option to replace -fpic by -fPIC.

 We've now switched to -fPIC for Solaris2 and SunOS4 for Apache 1.3.5.
 Thanks for your feedback.
