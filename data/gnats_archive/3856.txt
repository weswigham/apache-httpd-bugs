SunOS temp2 5.6 Generic_105181-10 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:

I'm not really sure if this is a bug but I haven't seen it described in any FAQ or newsgroup.

I have upgraded a Sun-Ultra1 from Solaris 1.5.1/Apache 1.2.6 to Solaris 2.6/Apache 1.3.3. The webserver has approxamately 1100 Virtu
alHosts which worked just fine before the upgrade. (the machine has 512 MB memory and 400 MB swap)

The problem, after the upgrade, is that each httpd-daemon grows to the size of 32 MB (!)
Whith Apache 1.2.6 they got the size of 5,2 MB which was ok.

The only difference I can see is the VirtualHost-format:

* Apache 1.2.6:

<VirtualHost www.some-domain.se>
ServerAdmin webmaster@www.some-domain.se
DocumentRoot /home/user7/domain/public_html
ServerName www.some-domain.se
LogFormat "@www.some-domain.se %h %{\"%Y%m%d%w%H%M%S\"}t %s %b %T \"%{Referer}i\">\"%r\""
</VirtualHost>

* Apache 1.3.3:

NameVirtualHost 123.456.78.910

<VirtualHost 123.456.78.910>  
ServerAdmin webmaster@www.some-domain.se
DocumentRoot /home/user7/domain/public_html
ServerName www.some-domain.se
LogFormat "@www.some-domain.se %h %{\"%Y%m%d%w%H%M%S\"}t %s %b %T \"%{Referer}i\">\"%r\""
</VirtualHost>

If I use the same VirtualHost-format as I did whith 1.2.6 I get this in my errorlog for each VirtualHost-entry:

httpd: [Mon Feb  8 10:15:03 1999] [warn] VirtualHost www.selda.se:80 overlaps with VirtualHost www.renvall.se:80, the first has precedence, perhaps you need a NameVirtualHost directive

... and the httpd:s grows to 32 Megz.

They still grow to 32 Megz if I use NameVirtualHost ...

As I said, I don't know if this is a bug but I think You should know about it.

Regards
