>Description:
In my srm.conf I have the following line:

DocumentRoot /disk2/apache/htdocs
Alias /tt/ /disk2/tt/

In my access.conf I have the following lines:

<Directory />
Options None
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

<Directory /disk2/apache/htdocs>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>

<Location ~ "^/tt">
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
</Location>

The problem is this:  In my directory /disk2/tt I have two files, one of which is a symbolic link to the other.
When I try to access the file, I get this error:

Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /tt/test2.html on this server

And my error log shows this:

[Wed Jul  1 16:39:47 1998] [error] Symbolic link not allowed: /disk2/tt/test2.html

The things that are odd:
1.  The symbolic links work fine in my document root, which uses the same "Options" line as the /tt directory
2.  The indexing works fine in my /tt directory, so half of my "Options" command works.

If I comment out "AllowOverride None" in my / config, it all works fine, but then my server is completely opened, and I would have to then restrict every directory.

State-Changed-Why:

It is not possible to use "Options FollowSymLinks" or
"Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch" inside a <Location>
section... you have to use a <Directory> section
(or you can put in a .htaccess file). 

Hmm... I think this isn't mentioned in the documentation.
I'll take a look at it.
