Windows 95 (4.00.950a)
>Description:
The files specified by the HeaderName and ReadmeName directives are not being added to the directory listings. The files specified do exist, and I've even tried reverting back to the default httpd.conf file. I didn't have this problem in 1.3.6, and I'm not sure if this is a problem that exists only on the Windows release.

State-Changed-When: Tue Sep  7 17:29:15 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Check the arguments to the IndexIgnore config directive. 
By default, it is set to ignore README* and HEADER* which
will match the files in /icons/. Furthermore, Win32 is case
preserving/aware but case insensitive. I.e., Header.html is 
the same as HeAdEr.HtMl. 

I suspect the code was not working correctly for Win32 
Apache pre-1.3.9, although I haven't checked.
 1.3.9

 If I understood the manual correctly, IndexIgnore only determines which
 filenames will not be displayed in the directory index.  I'm talking about
 the HeaderName and ReadmeName directives that append the contents of the
 header and readme files to the directory index.  They aren't working on
 Win32.  They worked for Win32 in 1.3.6, but they stopped working once I
 upgraded to 1.3.9.

Comment-Added:
I think I know what the problem is... Apache 1.3.9 requires
that the arguments to ReadmeName and HeaderName contain an 
extension recognized by the server, e.g., Readme.html.
Furthermore, the real file's name must exactly match the
file name specified in the config directive. This is a
change from pre 1.3.9 behaviour where the server would intuit the .html extension.  You may be able to enable multiviews in the directory to recover the previous 
behaviour.

 Thanks a lot.  It works now.  :)
 
 However, I think that a few things should be changed.
 
 1) the manual still uses for the example...
 
 HeaderName HEADER
 
 2) the default httpd.conf file still uses...
 
 HeaderName HEADER
 ReadmeName README
 
 And as I've just seen, it no longer works this way.

 Which did you change, multiviews or adding the extension?

 I renamed my header/readme files so that they had an extension and then
 changed the HeaderName/ReadmeName so that they used an extension.  I didn't
 try the MultiViews thing.
 
 I read your response to PR 4991, and I noticed that you said, "you ... have
 to specify the full name".  However, when my config had ReadmeName still
 pointing to README, the readme file in Apache's icons directory was not
 being added, even though the filename was exactly README.  However, once I
 added an extension to the readme file and changed my config to match, it
 worked.  So I take it that, now, not only do I have to specify the full
 name, but the file itself must also have an extension?

 Allthough I have followed the discussion in this problem report, I
 apparently have understood it all. I did read about the Multiview in the
 release message (Aug 31, 1999), but didn't realise the consequence of it.
 
 However, I do prefere the pre 1.3.9 way of handling README and HEADER
 files, so I would prefer Ken's way of doing it (i.e using MultiViews).
 
 I did include
 
 <Directory ...>
 
    Options ...  +MultiViews
 
 </Directory>
 
 -but this doesn't seems to work, when I am using virtul hosts. So
 apparently including Multiviews in the Options directive isn't enough.
 
 When I uses Kai's method, i.e. explicit defining the name of a file, e.g.
 
    HeaderName HEADER.html
  
 every thing, works just fine in Win32 as in the pre 1.3.9 days (allthough 
 all my README.txt files doesn't work).
 
 Help in this would be very much appreciated.

 Okay, I verified what Jens said.  MultiViews does NOT recover the old
 ReadmeName/HeaderName behavior.  The only way, as far as I can see, to
 specify header and footer files is to specify the actual filename and
 extension.  This is true whether I'm using virtual hosts or not.  I must
 agree w/ Jens on that it could be a pain now because either all your
 header/readme files use the same extension, or you have to make different
 settings for each directory.

Apache 1.3.18-dev - HEAD of cvs tree on 2/15/01:

Scenario: rename index.html.* in htdocs/manual/

Default httpd.conf file contains:

    IndexOptions FancyIndexing
    ReadmeName README
    HeaderName HEADER
    IndexIgnore .??* *~ *# HEADER* README* RCS CVS *,v *,t

Simple existing header.html file - is served.
Renamed to HEADER.html - is _NOT_ served (!?!)

I'm continuing to review
