>Description:
For a request containing no "Host:" header field, the server responds:

client sent HTTP/1.1 request without hostname (see RFC2068 section 9, and 14.23)

this should read RFC2616, as RFC2616 obsoletes RFC2068, and Apache 1.3 
claims to be RFC2616 compliant.
>How-To-Repeat:
$ telnet www.apache.org 80
GET / HTTP/1.1

>Fix:
change the string.
