>Environment:
Ultrix 4.4 on a DEC 5240 (MIPS) - C compiler irrelevant - fails in sed in shell script.
>Description:
I'm just reporting a recurrence of a problem which appears to have been exactly described by PR 3690 (still open) at Apache 1.3.4 - sorry if this is not an appropriate thing for me to do, but this is a later Apache release so I figured it may be relevant to do this.  

Here's what happens to me :-
  # sh5 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
  Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.6
   + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
  Creating Makefile
  Creating Configuration.apaci in src
  Creating Makefile in src
   + configured for ULTRIX platform
   + setting C compiler to cc
   + setting C pre-processor to cc -E
   + checking for system header files
  command garbled: s/\([^\]\)"/\1/g
  sh: htconf.5795.5: cannot open
   + adding selected modules
   + doing sanity check on compiler and options
  Creating Makefile in src/support
  Creating Makefile in src/main
  Creating Makefile in src/ap
  Creating Makefile in src/regex
  Creating Makefile in src/os/unix
  Creating Makefile in src/modules/standard
 
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run "sh5 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache" on Ultrix 4.4 with Apache 1.3.6.
>Fix:
In PR 3690 <gallo@pvt.sk> said :-

"(filter sed has a small "problem" with regular expressions).
Therefore it is necessary to slightly modify script ./src/Configure

this error message is displayed:

  command garbled: s/\([^\]\)"/\1/g
  sh: htconf.11251.5: cannot open

and file ./src/include/ap_config_auto.h will not be generated

Fix:

Replace 
  tmpstr=`echo $CFLAGS $TEXTRA_CFLAGS |\
          sed -e 's;[     ]-;!-;g' -e 's/\\\"/\"/g' -e 's/\([^\\]\)"/\1/g'`

by
  tmpstr=`echo $CFLAGS $TEXTRA_CFLAGS |\
          sed -e 's;[     ]-;!-;g' -e 's/\\\"/\"/g' -e 's/\([^\\\]\)"/\1/g'`

(e.g., one more backslash should be added in the third expression for sed)"

and this certainly seems to have worked for me.
