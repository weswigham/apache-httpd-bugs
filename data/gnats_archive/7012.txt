State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Tue Feb  6 15:02:39 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Mod_include has been completely re-written for 2.0, and is 
no longer a handler, but it is a filter instead.  Because of
this, the configuration you are using will not work.  The new
configuration sytax is:

<Files ~ "\.html$">
    AddOutputFilter INCLUDES
</Files>

Thank you for using Apache.
