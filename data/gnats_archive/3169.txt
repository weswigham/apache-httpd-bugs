Previously reported as PR 2727, now (incorrectly?) marked "closed".

It would be useful if the run-time directive "Include" could be used within
the "directory" context as well as the "server config" context. This would
allow a security policy to be defined in one place for several directories.

In PR 2727, it was reported that:
  This restriction has been lifted in a recently applied
  patch, and the change should be available in the next
  release after 1.3.1.  Thanks for the report, and for using
  Apache!

Unfortunately, the change didn't make it into 1.3.2, and there doesn't appear
to be a patch either.

 Why do you say it doesn't work in 1.3.2?
 
 Exactly what are you trying and what error do you get?

 I am trying to include some common authorisation information in several
 <Directory> sections. For example:
 
         <Directory /htdocs>
         Options         Indexes IncludesNOEXEC SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
         AllowOverride   None
         AuthName        Authorisation
         AuthType        Basic
         Include         /web/include/groupfile.conf
         </Directory>
 
 where /web/include/groupfile.conf contains the single line:
         AuthGroupFile   /web/setup/groups
 
 This produces the error message:
 "Syntax error on line 1 of /web/include/groupfile.conf: AuthGroupFile
 not allowed here"
 
 If I copy the contents of /web/include/groupfile.conf into the
 <Directory> section, and comment out the Include directive, it works
 fine.

 Well, that says it _IS_ allowing and processing the include, just not
 allowing what is in it.
 
 What if you set "AllowOverride all" for the /web/include directory?

 I didn't have anything set for the /web/include directory, since it's
 part of my setup structure and not part of my document tree. But I tried
 creating a <Directory> entry for it as well, with "AllowOverride all",
 and got the same error.
 
 I then repeated the process with the Include line as:
         Include         groupfile.conf
 and groupfile.conf in the same directory as httpd.conf (I normally run
 with the 3 files combined into one: I've tried splitting them, and the
 error message doesn't change). Unexpectedly, Apache went looking for it
 in ServerRoot rather than with the rest of the config files in
 ServerRoot/etc. So I tried again with:
         Include         etc/groupfile.conf
 ...and I was back to the same error message.

 I had a closer look at the source over the weekend, and I think I've
 found the problem. The function include_config in http_core.c is entered
 with parms->override set correctly, but it then calls the function
 ap_process_resource_config to process the resources in the file;
 ap_process_resource_config resets parms->override to (RSRC_CONF|OR_ALL)&
 ~(OR_AUTHCFG|OR_LIMIT), which only allows directives that are valid
 outside of <Directory> elements. In effect, this means that the Include
 directive can appear inside a <Directory> element, but only so long as
 the included file only contains directives that are valid outside.

 The problem still exists in Apache 1.3.6; I suspect fixing it will
 involve an entire re-write of how files are included.
