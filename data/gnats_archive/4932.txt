Running on a dual PII/450, pretty much standard 5.2 install
>Description:
I never experienced this problem under 1.3.6, which was running for a few months before I upgraded to 1.3.9.  When using simple shell-script CGI, the server seems to occasionally lose track of of the PATH variable.  I noticed this both under shell CGI and perl CGI using backtiks to shell a `sort` or `grep` on something.

The error log shows:
/home/www/www.apartmenthunt.com/cgi/vlist2.cgi: sort: command not found
/home/www/www.apartmenthunt.com/cgi/vlist2.cgi: grep: command not found
/home/www/www.apartmenthunt.com/cgi/vlist2.cgi: sh: command not found
/home/www/www.apartmenthunt.com/cgi/vlist2.cgi: cat: command not found

As mentioned, it only happens intermittently, and can fix by fully qualifying the commands (/bin/grep, etc)
