State-Changed-Why:
This is oracle's server, no?  If it can't find the key, it could be a
permissions problem, it could be a registry problem.

Error 7030 referred to an entirely different registry key,
accessed by another module, and appeared to be an installer
error.  Because the user had never _installed_ Apache, the
registry settings were not created.  That was the expected
and correct behavior.

The recording of otherwise 'invisible' errors into the
registry is by design.  The error is generated by an
Oracle module, not by Apache itself, so I'm afraid we can't
be of further help.
