apache
>Environment:
Environment is Linux 2.3.99pre9
Server version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) Debian/GNU
Server built:   Jan 26 2001 00:10:13
>Description:
The Apache server, from its default (Debian) install, does not understand requests for a wpad.DOMAIN.COM/wpad.dat site.

Further investigation seems that MS IE 5.5 is sending the request:
GET /wpad.dat HTTP/1.1

without sending a 1.1 Host: request (and so the server correctly responds with an error).

If the request
 GET /wpad.dat HTTP/1.0
is sent, the file is returned OK.

This is actually an MS IE 5.5 problem, but it may be worth putting information in the known clients page. Unfortunately, I don't know how to downgrade the response just for a single page to go back to the browser (or at least, ignore the fact that there is no host associated with it.)
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Create a file, /wpad.dat, and make it available (I have it through a Virtual Host, which may be an important issue)
2) Create a DNS alias to the server of wpad.DOMAIN.COM, with the local suffix
3) Configure IE 5.5 to use 'Automatic proxy detection' without any other commands
4) Look at a page in IE 5.5; the error log then shows a failed attempt of GET /wpad.dat HTTP/1.1, whilst GET /wpad.dat HTTP/1.0 works
>Fix:
There should be a way of forcing the result to use HTTP/1.0 (or interpret it as such) for URLs of the form /wpad.dat, but I don't know how ...
