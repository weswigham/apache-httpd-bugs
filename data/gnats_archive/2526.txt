>Description:
This is my first time setting up a server. Downloaded compiled version 1.3.0 from Apache site.
Read Ken Coar's book Apache Server for Dummies. Set up config files using examples from book 
and from another sparc that has Apache 1.2.5 running on it. Sever starts okay, no error msgs.
Daemons up and ready. I use Netscape to try and access the server. Get "connected, waiting
for reply". Nothing happens. The reply times out according to Netscape. Also tried
"telnet localhost 1425" as suggested by K.Coar. I get response then enter "HEAD / HTTP/1.0".
No response back. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I am behind an AT&T firewall. Don't know if you can get through! 135.33.1.36:1425

State-Changed-Why:
Did you hit ENTER twice after the "HEAD / HTTP/1.0"?
Just hitting it once won't trigger any response, since
the server is waiting for a blank line before doing
anything.

If you did a "telnet localhost 1425" then I assume you
set the server up with a "Port 1425" directive, and
gave Netscape a URL that included ":1425" in the host name?

  I don't think there is a problem with your book. I would think with my lack
 of experience, that the problem is here.
 I have no peers who have any experience with this, and the person who set up
 our other Apache site was contracted and
 has since moved on.
 
 In your book you suggested setting up a userid and groups. I didn't go
 though that sequence. I am the backup administrator
 (not a lot of experience) on this machine and can use root and my id. I
 tried setting up and running Apache from both id's( reinstalling, doing
 chown, 
 chgrp). I have double and triple checked the config files. I compared them
 to the other Apache we have on a different machine. I can do uucp and rcp
 functions to this host from other hosts.
