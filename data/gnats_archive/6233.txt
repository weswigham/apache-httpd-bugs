>Environment:
uname -a: IRIX psychoman 6.5 04151556 IP22
gcc -v:
Reading specs from /usr/freeware/lib/gcc-lib/mips-sgi-irix6.2/2.95.2/specs
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)

>Description:
Httpd seems to run fine, but the logs it produces (and the REMOTE_ADDR
variable) almost always has 255.255.255.255 as the IP Address.  Now and
then, with no apparent pattern, there's a 0.0.0.0 thrown in.  Of course,
there are no hostnames available.

This machine is connected directly to the internet, and netstat -an shows
the IP addresses that are connected to the webserver just fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have no idea how to repeat this problem; I've not found anyone else with this
problem.  I can send you the logs and configure files if necisary.
>Fix:
No idea. :-/
