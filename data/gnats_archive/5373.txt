php-3.0.12
Oracle 8.0.5
>Description:
when running apache + php with Oracle support the application dies on startup.
./httpd -X  runs nd dies giving the message 'nxm upcall: can't grow stack, pid 5789, proc httpd'
If I comment out the php module the process starts ok. If I then uncomment the php modules and SIGHUP the process the module loads and runs OK.
If I then SIGHUP it again to change config it dies and wont start.

This problem was already reported on the php knowledge base but the only answer was to get 1.3.9 and it syill has the same problem.
