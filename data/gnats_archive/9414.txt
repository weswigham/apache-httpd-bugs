Windows 98 OS. binary used. no patch.
>Description:
A laptop computer has been set up to connect from a LAN connection in the same LAN as the Apache web server, and to connect from other locations via ordinary dial-up (AOL) and ADSL. The laptop can access the web site from the LAN, but not from any other location we have tried. This can be a serious problem for business people who use laptops as desktop substitutes in two different offices.

The web site is http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/
>How-To-Repeat:
You can try to repeat it bu using a laptop in the same manner. However, not ALLlaptops do it: th problem seems to be with some machines, not others.
>Fix:
I think the problem may be that the server is identify the laptop, when it tries to connect from outside the LAN, as the same laptop that connects successfully via the LAN and that this is for some reason enough to deny access. I have no idea how to fix it; I think this is the reason.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Tue Jan  8 16:16:28 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

Apache cannot and does not differentiate between laptop
and desktop computers.  Most likely, you have some basic
configuration problem in your network or laptop.
Unfortuantely, we know nothing about your setup, and we
really can't help with these types of problems, since
they do not involve a bug in apache.

You could try a user support group such as:
http://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html

But if you do, you'll need to provide more details
about your setup.

Thanks for using Apache.
