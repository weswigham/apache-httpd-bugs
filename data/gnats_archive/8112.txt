Comment-Added:
As an answer to your question about xbithack, this has just
been re-enabled in Apache 2.0.  I have not looked into the
other PR in this PR.

This entire class of mod_includes issues have been resolved
in the most current cvs tree, and will be incorporated in
the next alpha release (2.0.25 or later).

Comment-Added:

One last note - autoindex/negotation/mime modules were
all recently overhauled (.24, IIRC) so the several issues
in this PR should all be resolved

Please let us know if you can reproduce from the current
tree, or the next (.26 or higher) release.
