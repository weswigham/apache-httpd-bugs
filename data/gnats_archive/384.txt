>Description:
In order to keep compact (and easy to read) files comment could be held in
the configuration lines, as follows:

Port            80                          #; Must be root if < 1024
HostnameLookups On                          #; On/Off. Log names/IP addresses
User            nouser                      #; Name or Id
Group           nogroup                     #; Name or Id
#BrowserMatch   Mozilla/2 nokeepalive

By this way comment would be:

    Any line starting by # at column 1

    Any characters after the #; sequence

The double character allows both # and ; to be part of non-comment field
in any config line
