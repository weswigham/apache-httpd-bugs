>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Linux for S/390 2.4.7 & Linux for zSeries 2.4.7
>Description:
The files:
./srclib/apr/build/config.guess
./srclib/apr/build/config.sub
./srclib/pcre/config.guess
./srclib/pcre/config.sub
./srclib/apr-util/xml/expat/conftools/config.guess
./srclib/apr-util/xml/expat/conftools/config.sub

need to be replaced by the latest level in order to support s390x-ibm-linux (64-bit Linux on S/390).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Replace config.[sub|guess] with latest levels from automake. (Mine is automake-1.4-15 but not sure if there's a local SuSE fix in there.)
