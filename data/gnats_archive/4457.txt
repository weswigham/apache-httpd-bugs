SunOS 5.7 Generic i86pc (Solaris 7/Intel)
gcc 2.8.1
Apache 1.3.6
mod_perl 1.19
>Description:
I followed the "flexible way" outlined in the mod_perl INSTALL doc for "building
mod_perl as DSO inside Apache source tree via APACI."

Running /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start causes a "Segmentation Fault - core dumped".

No such problem when I build mod_perl statically.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Nope. I know the docs say this is experimental, so I'm not griping, just reporting.

(please ignore the previous mail, I'm obviously too tired to hit the right buttons right now)

Could you please try again with mod_perl v1.20?

Please see the SUPPORT document in the mod_perl distribution for how to make a stack trace after the core dump.
