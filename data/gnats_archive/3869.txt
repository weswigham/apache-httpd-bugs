>Description:
After running the server for a while, I got much httpd processes in "reading" state. Timeout is set to 10 ! I tried telnetting to the server and it doesn't close the connection after the timeout. 
It seems, that the server doesn't close open connections after the timeout period or ignores the Timeout value set in the config file.

Workaround: restarting the server every hours

 Hi Lars,
 
 maybe you looked at the server when it was night in Germany -=20
 then there is not much traffic.
 Please try telneting to port 80 and let the telnet session be=20
 opened for a while without doing something. Server timeout is=20
 set to 10 seconds. Thus, the server should close the=20
 connection after 10 seconds, but nothing happens.=20
 
 Daniel

Do you have any non-standard modules installed... such as
