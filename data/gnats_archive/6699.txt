>Description:
I used the following configuration:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache-1.3.14 \
--enable-module=rewrite --enable-module=auth_dbm \
--with-layout=Apache

Running "make" has everything compile without error, everything looks good.  When I do a "make install"
though, I find an empty "libexec" directory.  Looking at src/modules/standard, there are a number
of .o files, and I did double-check that the modules were compiled without error.
>How-To-Repeat:
I've been able to repeat it by doing a "make distclean", running the configure call from the full description,
and doing a "make" then "make install".

State-Changed-Why:

Since you are compiling the models statically, they are
included in the Apache executable, httpd.  If you
want dynamically loadable modules, check the documentation
on the --enable-shared option to configure.
