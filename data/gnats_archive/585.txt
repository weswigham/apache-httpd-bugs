>Description:
On a Solaris 2.3 machine running Apache 1.2b7, .htaccess files in directories
to be protected are being ignored and full access is being granted to anybody.

To verify that my .htaccess file is correct, I tried it on an RS-6000/320
machine running Apache 1.2b7 and it worked fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is the .htaccess file from /usr/local/wwwroot/mrtg in question:

Options Indexes
AllowOverride None
AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName
AuthType Basic

<Limit GET>
require user xth0009
</Limit>

When this file is inserted into access.conf with the <DIRECTORY> </DIRECTORY>
tags inserted, it works fine (only if .htaccess is not in the directory listed.)
If .htaccess is in the specified directory, an error message is returned.
>Fix:
Add the contents of the .htaccess files to access.conf.  But this defeats the
purpose of having .htaccecs files

State-Changed-Why:
Have you checked your error_log file after a request 
which ignored your .htaccess? It will probably tell you 
that the AllowOverride directive is not allow here. Remove 
the AllowOverride and try it again (AllowOverride is 
valid inside <Directory> sections, but NOT in .htaccess). 
 
If your .htaccess file is being ignored, it might be 
because you have AllowOverride None in a <Directory> entry 
in access.conf for the same directory, or a parent 
directory.
