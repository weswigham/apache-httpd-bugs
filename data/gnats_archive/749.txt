>Description:
If you query the database for a category of "mod_mime", the query-pr
command issued looks like '--Category="mod[ _mime]"'; if you ask for
"mod_log-any" or "mod_auth-any", the category criterion is omitted
altogether.
>How-To-Repeat:
Query the database for "mod_auth-any" and "open".
>Fix:

State-Changed-Why:
I'm not worried about the issue of weird quoting around "_".
The inability to use "-" is more worrisome, since it fails 
to find a match.  However, it appears that the category 
search is simply a substring search rather than an exact 
match, so stripping off the "-" (and anything after it) 
after the <OPTION> tag will probably work fine.  Should be
relatively easy to do, though it won't win any beauty contests.

Comment-Added:
I've tracked the cause of this down.  It's not the
presence of either "_" or "-" that triggers it,
it's the presence of the token "any" bounded by
what Perl thinks are word boundaries.  A little
matter to fix up..
