>Environment:
NT 4.0 Workstation SR3
>Description:
This is related to bugs 1458 and 1489.  Apache 1.3b3 runs OK as an
app under NT, but as a service it works only if installed in C:/Apache
but not if installed in the more normal (to Windows) place of
C:/Program Files/Apache.

I suspect there may be a registry key which could be manually modified
to pass the -d option to Apache, but it is considered poor form for
Windows programs to require users to manually change registry keys,
or for programs to care which specific directories they are installed in.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install the Windows 1.3b3 binary distribution using the supplied
install routine, accepting C:/Program Files/Apache as the install
location. CD to that directory, run "Apache -i", then reboot.  Service
does not run. 

Next, try the same only install to C:/Apache.  Works fine.
>Fix:
Include appropriate registry mods in install routine.  Better yet, get
the location of APACHE.EXE from the OS and locate other directories
relative to the actual location of APACHE.EXE (rather than assuming
C:/Apache).  This avoids the need for registry mods.

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, at the moment Apache does not run very well as
a service unless it is installed in C:\APACHE. 

This will be tracked in PR#1489.
