>Description:
The code for HAVE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is not portable to HPUX11 because there is no /dev/zero. But on HPUX it is possible to map pages anonymous as shown below. I run a server on the hardware described in the Environment window and it looks fine.
To run the server with PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT the ap_config.h file has to be changed.

Kind regards

Comment-Added:
I think it should be arranged as the following so that
it continues to work the same on AIX.  Can you try this
out?

#if defined(HPUX11)
  your code
#else
  existing code
#endif

If your code doesn't break anything, I don't see why we
can't commit it.

Thanks!
