>Description:
ProxyPassReverse directive tries to prevent the browser from getting pointed
to the original site when original server sends a redirect header.
Some servers (Like Microsoft IIS) send a Content-Location header in similar kind of situations as redirects are used.
When requesting something like http://server.domain/directory/, IIS send a document (index.html or whatever) with a Content-Location header defined as http://server.domain/directory/index.html
Some browsers (not all) use this information when following links from page just received.
This will point the browser to the original site rather than using ProxyPass server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up an IIS server and define apache to ProxyPass the root of IIS server to /iis-server/. Create index.html to root of IIS server.
Then point lynx to the http://apacheserver/iis-server/  .
Follow some link on the index page and see your browser requesting data directly from IIS-server rather than apache-server.
>Fix:
Modify ProxyPassReverse directive to modify also Content-Location header.
Or add another directive (ProxyPassContentlocation) for this purpose.
