         HOME-EMPLOYMENT POSITIONS:

WORD PROCESSING, TYPING, COMPUTER-WORK, HOME-
ASSEMBLY, ART WORK, MAIL PROCESSING, FREELANCE
WRITING, SEWING, PLUS MUCH MORE......
***********************************************
Welcome to an alternative!!  This report will 
detail a way to earn an extra or full time income 
from HOME.  Haven't you ever wished you can spend 
more time with your family and retain the mind 
peace of REAL JOB SECURITY.  You see, the world of 
home-employment has a plethora of companies that 
have an UNLIMITED need for homeworkers (We will 
explain why shortly).  You will find a large variety 
of job descriptions to match your individual talents
or abilities.  Whether you wish to do data-entry on 
contract or perform simple home-assembly, read on...

Power Publishing was founded on a commitment to 
Excellent customer service.  We have published 
such best-sellers as " MORTGAGE BUSTER ", " THE 
HOTTEST HOME-BUSINESSES IN THE 90's " and many 
other informative books, manuals and guides.  More 
importantly, we have a solid reputation based on 
years of reliable business dealings.  

During the past 4 years our company has developed 
an extensive and unique publication revealing real 
home employers. Our guide features a vast array of 
companies with all types of home employment. This 
is NOT a book on how to freelance.

Now back to YOUR benefit from this publication.  
Let us explain further on how this works.  We 
are talking about the ability to turn your spare 
time in to MONEY.  Many big companies benefit from 
contracting work to homeworkers.  They save big 
at tax-time and do not have to worry about employee 
paperwork, deductions, etc...  This creates a niche 
for people just like you.  If you are struggling 
from paycheck to paycheck, why not engage in pleasant 
work from your home and make a good supplemental or 
full-time income?  You can work at your own pace with 
no quotas to fill.  Best of all, you do not have to 
purchase anything to start working for these companies.


Here are a few examples:

* Word Processing - up to $424.00 weekly

* Data Entry - up to $357.00 weekly

* Home Assembly - up to $600.00 weekly

* Crafts - up to $374.00 weekly

The list goes on.  No previous experience is required 
to begin.  Also, you are not OBLIGATED to work for
just one company.  In fact, you will find multiple 
companies that offer the same opportunity.  How about 
getting multiple CHECKS each week?  That is exactly 
what happens.  Working at home is far more comfortable
and rewarding.  As a result, getting more done in less
time is a natural occurrence.

Through our extensive research in to this industry, 
we bring youthe cream of the crop.  No fly-by-night
scam operations.  Included in our guide are only
solid, legitimate companies that have been around
for quite some time.  There is something for everybody
in our publication no matter where you live(US or Canada).

Our guarantee is simple.  Contact a few of the 
companies Listed in this publication within a 3 
month period.  If you have not found a home 
employment position or are not satisfied with the
kind of money you are earning, we will immediately 
issue you a refund.

                     SPECIAL UPDATE!!!

Receive the " Guide To Home Employment " via
e-mail.  That's right, no need for unnecessary snail-
mail delays.  We will send you this guide in the form
of a file over the internet. This means you will
receive it the same day we receive your order.


To join the millions of Americans already working
from home, order today!  This complete home-
employment guide is available for the nominal fee 
of $22.00.

Don't put off you and your family enjoying the 
income and the security of home-employment 
any longer........
