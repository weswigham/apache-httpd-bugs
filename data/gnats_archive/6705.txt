WinNT 4.0 SP5
Apache 1.3.14
JServ 1.1.2
>Description:
Since 1.3.14, if Apache on NT reads the configuration-Files for JServ, it doesn't recognize the backslashes as (valid) slashes in the path-names. Apache automatically writes slashes in pathes, but JServ uses (Windows-like) backslashes. This - for example - produces the following error message (if at least the import-line in httpd.conf is written with slashes):

Syntax error on line 9 of c:/Programme/ApacheGroup/ApacheJServ/conf/jserv.conf:
Cannot load c:/programme/apachegroup/apache/C:\Programme\ApacheGroup\ApacheJServ
\ApacheModuleJServ.dll into server: (126)
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install Apache 1.3.14 and JServ 1.1.2 on NT.
>Fix:
Two possibilities:

1.) Get Apache to recognize backslashes again
2.) Let JServ produce slashes in the path-names on NT

I would prefer 2.), so one would have almost the same conf-files on NT and on UNIX.
