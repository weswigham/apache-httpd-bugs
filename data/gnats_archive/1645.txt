>How-To-Repeat:
Define a CustomLog directive like this:
CustomLog logs/test_log "%h<tab>%U"

In the file test_log you'll get:
%h<space>%U
>Fix:
No. I read mod_log_config.c, and couldn't find anywhere a specific
case relating to tabs. To me it seems like the log format string is just
copied as is (mod_log_config.c, line 399).
Maybe the string is touched before being passed to mod_log_config%3

 This is not an area that should be patched.  Whitespace in the
 config file is whitespace, and gets collapsed to single spaces.
 What's broken is that "\t" (among others) doesn't work in
 CustomLog and LogFormat directives.

 Not! (of course not...) I've found at least one problem, with the
 "require" directive. 
 
 In the config file:
 
 1)	require <sp> group <ht> my-group
 2)	require <ht> group <sp> my-group
 
 1) is broken, I don't know what the code for the require directive
 understands, but obvisouly not the Right Thing. The group authentication
 doesn't work at all. No error message though.
 
 2) works fine.
 
 I'm afraid this particular problem might happen here and there over and
 over again. So my patch is wrong, and we're back to step 1: a real patch
 is needed.

This behaviour has been corrected and the fix should appear
