>Environment:
problem present on both BSD/OS 2.1 w/all available patches and BSD/OS 3.0, so 
we don't think it's a FIN_WAIT_2 problem.
>Description:

Apache apparently stops responding to HTTP requests on all configured Listen ports.
Usually, after 15 minutes or so (but sometimes more), it comes back to
life and works normally.

Nothing abnormal in the log files.	

>How-To-Repeat:
I have a cron job that checks Apache using a perl script that runs wget on the status
page.  I can provide you with detailed information gathered from the script when wget
returns with a timeout (180 seconds): netstat -an, ps -aux, the last Apache status
page that was fetched before it stopped responding, or anything else you might suggest.
Apache is also SIGHUP'ed by this script after wget returns with a timeout error,
and that's successful to get it to work again.

The web server address is http://w3.cedep.net/.  The locations server-status
and server-info are both enabled.
>Fix:
Unfortunately, no. Just in case, we will recompile with -DNO_LINGCLOSE.%0
