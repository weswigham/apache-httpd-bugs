With multiple virtual hosts sharing one IP address (named virtual hosts),
the SSL module always presents the certificate from the first NameVirtualHost
regardless of the Host: in the request from the client.  However, the data
which gets served comes from the proper VirtualHost DocumentRoot.

 Since the Host: header is part of the encrypted stream, it is not
 known to the server by the time the cert is required to establish an
 SSL connection.  For this reason it is not possible to do name-based
 virtual hosting w/ SSL.
 
 Perhaps we should make this an explicit failure condition in the
 mod_ssl code?

 From someone who lurks on the modssl-users list, I can tell you right now
 that this is _the_ most frequently asked question... doing something about
 it would be good.  Can we detect and log it at least?  Or do we do that
 already.  I thought we did for some reason.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a fact of life with SSL : name based virtual hosting doesn't work.  It's the chicken-and-the-egg problem described in the mod_ssl docs.
