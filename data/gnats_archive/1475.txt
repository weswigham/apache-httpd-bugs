>Description:
I know that it might not be problem of Apache (as far as it can be problem of IE4 of course), but i am trying to battle Microsoft to do their job and therefore i need backing and crosscheck from other side.

If anyone has possesion of IE 4.0 (release version) try to go to (for example) http://www.softnov.cz, let page load, then switch to OFFLINE mode and try to type that URL again. It should load it from cache. It does not.

Apparently ANY pages received from that particular installation of Apache (it is largest Czech ISP with hundreths of virtual webs on Apache) is somehow non cooperating with IE 4.0 - www.apache.org is (for example) cached properly

Can someone help me with finding a reason for this?

Note the Vary: header.  That means that the content may
be different if you send a different accept-charset or 
user-agent.  MSIE's cache implementation is, for whatever
reason, not figuring out that it can safely cache it.
It could be because it may not send an accept-charset
yet it gets an accept-charset back.  Read RFC-2068
for details on how Vary: works.
