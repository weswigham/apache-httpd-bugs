 hey guys.. I will make this short and sweet.. 
 in the http_main.c there is a spot in the code that
 switches the user and group id from 0 to 99 (the user
 nobody) on the shared memory segment.. this causes my
 httpd binary to bail and print out to the log the
 subject of this message. Do you have any idea why it
 is doing this? shoudln't a shared memory segment that
 is owned by root be able to change to nobody??
 
 thanks for the help (I have apache running on like 10
 differnet machines and only this one mandrake box is
 causing this problem and apache used to work on it
 just fine... do you think my libc could be
 foo-barred???? this bug is really anoying me...
 
 thanks...
