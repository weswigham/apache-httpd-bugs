>Environment:
NetBSD/i386 1.3.1
gcc 2.7.2.2+myc1
>Description:
Default configuration for NetBSD should be more optimal.
HAVE_SHMGET, USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD, HAVE_MMAP, USE_MMAP_SCOREBOARD,
and USE_MMAP_FILES should be defined and system regex could
be used instead of HSREGEX.
>How-To-Repeat:
look at src/conf.h and notice some features of NetBSD are not used
compile Apache and see HSREGEX is used 
>Fix:
There is a patch which adds appropriate entries into src/Configure
and src/include/conf.h at
	http://www.ics.muni.cz/~dolecek/NetBSD/apache13_optimize_netbsd
