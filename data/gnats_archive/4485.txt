>Environment:
I am an end user inquiring about Apache server generically.  My ISp who runs APache is IPASS.net
>Description:
Given the example of an active-X component I wrote, at 

http://www.ipass.net/~pjm/webstock.html

I can not get this to DL and run correctly from the Apache based server at IPASS.  They state that they have no policy against it, and would gladly install any patch or upgrade you might have available.

I know the Active-X HTML and CAB files are correct, because I can deploy them via my corporate web server without problem.

Implement Active-X support ?
