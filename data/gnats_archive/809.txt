Linux 2.0.29, normal gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
I'm not sure wether this is really a bug, or just a configuration problem of mine,
but everything works fine except of some chat-servers, which do not send the
dynamically generated pages used for the chat-output, when they are accessed
via our proxy.

>How-To-Repeat:
One example which does not work properly is: www.online1.de
Choose "Connecting People" and then "Chat Forum". After trying to log in
the screen changes to the usual frames (one on the top - ok, one at the bottom also ok,
and one in the middle - no output shown). The chat-output should be shown in the
middle (try without proxy and it works).

Not yet - sorry. That's why I write this email :-%2

State-Changed-Why:
The site you give as an example works by not closing the
connection to the client so it can keep adding new data.
The way the Apache proxy works, it gets the entire
document before sending it to the client.  Since it never
gets the entire document, it will never send it to the
client.  Unfortunately, I can't really think of a workaround.

This isn't a bug in Apache, but it would be nice if such
things worked.  At some point the proxy may be changed so
it sends to the client while downloading from the server.

Sorry - I forgot to send the rest of my logfile with the last report:

Hope that helps a little bit, because I've really no idea what's going wrong.
