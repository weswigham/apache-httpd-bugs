>Description:
Hi,
    I'm trying to set up my access.conf like so (the IPs @c have been
changed to protect the innocent):

<Directory />
...
Order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 10.1.1.0/8 10.1.2.0/8 10.1.4.0/8 # doesn't allow any of these
</Directory>

It turns out that 8-bit CIDR Masks don't work.  16-bit masks will, and
regular masks (10.1.1.0/255.255.255.0) masks will, but 8-bit CIDR masks won't.
I'd prefer to use the CIDR masks, but can work around this by using the 
original (10.1.1) or full (10.1.10/255.255.255.0) masks..

 I'm confused.
 
 Exactly what size of netblock are you trying to configure?
 
 A /8 is the same size as a class A, ie. 255.0.0.0.
 
 A /24 is the same size as a class C, ie. 255.255.255.0

 Hi,
 	Sorry bout that, _I_ had it backwards.  It was late, I was
 tired, I was thinking '8-bits mask' instead of '8-bits address'..
 
 Cancel it out.
 
 Thanks,
 Mathew A. Hennessy (hennessy@thoughtcrime.com)
 
 ps:	Best regards for an excellent product!
