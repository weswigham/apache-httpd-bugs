>Organization:
>Environment:
Redhat Linux 7: Kernel 2.2.16-22 i86
>Description:
N/A
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Protect a directory called /members/ using .htaccess
2. Create a file called index.html in that directory
3. Configure DirectoryIndex to serve index.html
4. Point IE5 to /members/index.html
5. Click Cancel in Login box or enter random login/passwords
6. Browser will display authentication error message
7. Click Back on the browser and the browser will display /members/index.html page without any authentication!!!


>Fix:
This doesn't happen with Netscape 4.7

If you point to members/members.html (or any other file other than index.html) everything works fine in both Netscape and IE5.
