>Description:
I am trying to deny 'POST' capability from anonymizer.com - an anonymous web proxy that is open to anyone.  I can't seem to figure out the proper combination of mod_access directives to make it work.
Here is my current .htaccess file:

AuthName BulletinBoardAnonDeny
AuthType Basic
ErrorDocument 403 http://www.richnet.net/wwwboard/anondeny.html
Satisfy all

<limit POST>
order deny,allow
deny from 209.75.196 .infonex.com .infonex.net .anonymizer.com
allow from all
</limit>
>How-To-Repeat:
try going to www.anonymizer.com - select their 'surf for free' and in the form fill-in field, enter:
http://www.richnet.net/wwwboard
try posting something (it allows it just fine)
>Fix:
I have tried changing the order, and various combination on the deny command line.  Initially I did not include the Satisfy line either

State-Changed-Why:
Remove the Auth* directives and the satisfy any.

You are telling Apache that _either_ your basic authentication
restrictions have to be satisified or the domain based
restrictions have to be satisfied by using the "satisfy any"
directive.

Yet your basic auth restrictions don't restrict it to any
user, but allow everyone access so they can be always
satisfied.
