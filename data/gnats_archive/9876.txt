>Release:        2.0.32-beta
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows NT 4 (SP5).  A previous installation of Apache 1.3.14 was already installed as a service.  Installing to D:\Program Files\Apache Group\
>Description:
On installation, just as the install script tries to start Apache, I get "The instruction at 0x6ee04052" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory could not be read."  I also get a similar traceback when attempting to stop it.

The first attempt at installation, I stopped 1.3.14, but did not uninstall it as a service.  When the setup script tried to start apache, I got the memory access error as above.  When I finally did start it, it appeared to be 1.3.14.

My second attempt, I uninstalled 1.3.14 as a service, uninstalled 2.0.32-beta and tried reinstalling 2.0.32-beta.  I got the exact same error message and no Apache HTTPD entry in the Services list.
