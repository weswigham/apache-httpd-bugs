>Description:
The following two procedures are not supposed to return a value but they do:

void jserv_setalive(jserv_config *cfg, jserv_host *cur) {
        /* we do not override admin commands (state=SHUTDOWN*) */
        return jserv_changestate(cfg, cur, "-", '+');
}

void jserv_setdead(jserv_config *cfg, jserv_host *cur) {
        /* we do not override admin commands (state=SHUTDOWN*) */
        return jserv_changestate(cfg, cur, "+", '-');
}

-----------------------------------------
 In procedure jserv_getnext_host the following cast creates a problem since
it's not an lvalue:

(int)shmhost->opaque += 1;
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A
>Fix:
Remove the "return"s and the (int) cast.
