>Description:
apache urldecodes path-info but not query strings.
the upshot is that cgi-scripts lack information about what was really
sent to the server since the urldecoder does not fail when there are
characters that should have been encoded.
You should not urlencode
>How-To-Repeat:
make a cgi that prints the environment
try typing:
http://server.com/cgi-bin/printenv/foo%20goo/doo=hoo%20goo
>Fix:
turn off url-decoding of path-info or make it a config option
1. no urldecoding of path-info
2. urldecoding only for correctly encoded path-info
3. urldecoding of all path-info (current behavior%2

State-Changed-Why:
By the only "spec" for CGI, the documentation at 
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/, PATH_INFO is to be 
URL-decoded.  There's really no reason not to do that.

Check out http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html, it says:

> The extra path information, as given by the client. In 
> other words, scripts can be accessed by their virtual
> pathname, followed by extra information at the end of 
> this path. The extra information is sent as PATH_INFO.
> This information should be decoded by the server if it 
> comes from a URL before it is passed to the CGI script.
