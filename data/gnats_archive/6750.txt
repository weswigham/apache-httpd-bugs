>Description:
with this line in the httpd.conf

# process other requests
RewriteRule     ^/(.*)$         /${lowercase:%{SERVER_NAME}}/$1

accessing any server now results in the path
<server_root>/%{server_name}/<path>

and not 

<server_root>/<value of %{SERVER_NAME}>/<path>

changing the rewrite rule to

RewriteRule    ^/(.*)$         /%{SERVER_NAME}/$1

works correctly
>How-To-Repeat:
using RewriteRule given above to access fu.bar.com you will notice that
with 1.3.14, apache will try to access

/server/root/%{server_name}/

and not

/server/root/fu.bar.com/

>Fix:
the ${} and %{} need to be recursively evaluated from the inside not from
the outside

e.g. the current code seems to to the following transformations

${lowercase:%{SERVER_NAME}} -> %{server_name} and %{server_name} can't be found
so we're done

this really should be evaluated as 

${lowercase:%{SERVER_NAME}} -> ${lowercase:FU.bar.com} -> fu.bar.com

 also there is another small bug that is not covered by
 this patch. when a key is not matched, the '\0' that was
 inserted into the string to mark the end of the current {}
 section is not removed.
 
 to fix, this code
 
                 key = strchr(inp, ':');
                 if (key == NULL) {
                     goto skip;
 		}
 
 needs to have this line inserted
 
                key = strchr(inp, ':');
                 if (key == NULL) {
 +		    *endp = '}'
                     goto skip;
                 }
