27.Why does Apache send a cookie on every response?
I would replace "Note that in 1.2" with "Note that in 1.2 and above"

in
34.How can I get my script's output without Apache buffering it? Why doesn't my server
    push work?
I would replace "Note that in version 1.3, all CGI scripts will be"
with "Note that in version 1.3, all CGI scripts are"
