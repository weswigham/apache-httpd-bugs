 Collectable Christian Music Fans  12/10/00
 
 This is M8 Distribution, the worlds #1 Limited Edition Christian Distribution Company. If you don't want to be on our email list simply reply with a remove in the subject line and we will remove you from our list. 
 
 The Live at Cornerstone 2000 Live series far exceeded anything we could have ever imagined!  Thank you all for making it such a great success.  Please note that we only have the titles listed on the web site.  Many of our titles have sold out within the  last few weeks and it is now reflected as such on our web site.
 
 I think this month brings a little something for everyone.  Batting leadoff is the 77's and Mike Roe with Jamie Rowe and Steve Scott for you Alternative Rockers.  Of course Deliverance, Lust Control and Leviticus for you Metal heads.  Feezel, Browbeats a nd Pashawkee for you who want something a bit more modern.  This month we also have a great classical piano piece just in time for Christmas by Jeffrey Little.
 
 The new flash based web site is 100% complete!  Check it out today.  We recommend that you use the flash based part of the web site as it is updated much more often and we will be closing the non-flash part sometime in early 2001.
 
 As most of you already know this Tuesday is new release day.  Below are our new releases with the prices.  More info is available on each title at the M8 web site.
