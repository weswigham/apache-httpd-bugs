>Release:        1.1.1
>Environment:
I have tried this on a number of versions of Linux's kernel.  It happens on all of the ones I tried.  2.0.12 to about 2.0.24 or so.
>Description:
If you do not define a valid server name for each and every virtual defined, 
the first virtual defined will work and all others child processes for the virtuals 
and default host will core dump.

I have not tested this for 1.2, but it is consistant for 1.1.1.
>How-To-Repeat:
Define a bunch of <VirtualHost>s using IP addesses.  Do not give them any 
server host names.  Restart the server.  No errors in the log.  Connect to any of
the IP addresses (i.e. http://101.44.43.11/ ) and watch it fail on everything
BUT the first virtual defined in the list.  It will not kill the server, just
the child processes.  
>Fix:
Test if virtuals have the server host name defined
