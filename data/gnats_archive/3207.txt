>Description:
There's no hint in Apache-Win32-Docs that you have to set the permissions
of the dirs which contain the HTML-Files to be served at least to SYSTEM=read under
Windows NT 4.0 Server SP3 in order to get apache 1.3.2 to work. Otherwise Apache
only states that it couldn't find the requested file.

Include an hint to the Win32 section of the Apache Docs here on www.apache.org
or include a tip to the docs in the package.
