State-Changed-Why:
It does not include a htpasswd executable because, as
documented, it doesn't support encrypted passwords yet.
When it does, it will.  You can't build htpasswd under
Win32 period right now.

The format is simply "username:password", one per line,
so it is easy enough to create with any text editor.  When
the passwords are encrypted, it will not be as easy and
so the htpasswd utility will be provided.
