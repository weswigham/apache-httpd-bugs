BSD/OS lc.alink.net 3.1 BSDI BSD/OS 3.1 Kernel #16: Fri Jan 22 14:42:48 PST 1999     root@lc.alink.net:/usr/src/sys/compile/ALINK  i386
>Description:
There are two problems.  First, GuessOS doesn't distinguish between BSD/OS 3
and BSD/OS 4.  It must, because the correct procedure for building DSOs under 
BSD/OS 3 is different from under BSD/OS 4.

Second, of course, src/Configure lacks knowledge of how to do DSOs under 
BSD/OS 3, although what it has for *bsdi* is correct for BSD/OS 4.

I don't know when dlopen() was introduced into BSD/OS.  It is possible that the
instructions I give for BSD/OS 3 are also correct for 2.  However, I don't have
a BSD/OS 2 machine available to me any more.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Yes, here are patches:

For GuessOS:

*** GuessOS     1999/04/01 05:36:20     1.1.1.4
--- GuessOS     1999/05/30 02:58:40

and for src/Configure (note, I do *not* supply a rule for *bsdi*):

            LDFLAGS_SHLIB="-shared"
            LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT="-rdynamic"

Note that it's important, when building for dlopen() on BSD/OS 3, that the
compiler for httpd itself be shlicc or shlicc2.  Will setting CC in the above
location have the desired effect?
