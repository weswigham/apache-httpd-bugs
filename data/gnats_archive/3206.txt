>Environment:
WinNT JRun 2.2 Apache 1.3.2
>Description:
I have installed Apache. I can see the "IT WORKED" screen. I then install JRun and configure the connector for NT. Then 
I try to execute the Apache.exe after checking that the *.conf files are updated by the JRun installation which they are.
The error says :
http: module"(null)" is not compatable with this version of Apache. Consult your vendor .... 
Managed to isolate the problem by commenting out lines and it relates to the mod_jrun.dll loaddll command in the httpd.conf.
The dll exists alongside the others that are loaded thru a standard execution of Apache that works.

State-Changed-Why:

As the error message says, this is clearly a problem with
the 3p module you're trying to add.  It must have been
built against a version of Apache prior to 1.3.2.  You
need to get a newer version of it.  Since it is a 3p
module problem and not an Apache issue per se, there is
nothing more we can do for you.  Good luck, and thanks
for using Apache!
