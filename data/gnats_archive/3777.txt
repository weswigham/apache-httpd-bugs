State-Changed-When: Tue Jan 26 18:21:36 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
It really helps here if you take five minutes and take a
little bit of effort that can save everyone a lot of time.

First, as we ask before you submit a report, what is in
the error log when you try to start it?

How are you trying to restart it?

Are you using Apache installed from source, or from some
Red Hat RPM?

   Sorry, i discover the lack of a log directory in the tree - so it's
 the reason why!
 But apache nevertheless succeeded the configtest, so i wonder and ask
 you,
 the problem is not really a bug,
 Thank for your support
