>Description:
I am attempting to run a PERL script called test.cgi. I am getting on my Netscape 3.04 window-

Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

in error_log, this comes up each time I run the script..

[Mon Jan 19 08:19:13 1998] [error] Premature end of script headers: c:/apache/cgi-bin/test1.cgi

  Here is the Script in it's entirety..
#!\Perl\bin/Perl
print <<END_of_Multiline_Text;
Content-type: text/html

<html><head><title>Hello World</title></head>
<body><font size=7 color=red>HELLO WORLD
</body></html>

END_of_Multiline_Text

   I cannot Figure out the trouble, and I have read the FAQ from APACHE and from
PERL. This all runs fine from the command line. Am I just being stupid???

Why are you mixing '/'s and '\'s in the path?

Try using all '/'s.
