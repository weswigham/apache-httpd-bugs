>Description:
Running 122 virtual domains, exec cgi stops working. Since exec cmd 
still works, I don't think this is a problem with OS configuration, 
but I may be wrong. I tried increasing /proc/sys/kernel/file-max 
and /proc/sys/vm/freepages and that didn't change the problem, but 
I commented out a few virtual domains and the problem went away. 

I need to know what resources I'm running out of. The message in the 
error log is "couldn't spawn child process". But why would #exec cmd 
work and not #exec cgi? Looks buggish from this end. 

TIA,

State-Changed-Why:
You are running out of file descriptors.  See
the FAQ and the document at http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/descriptors.html

My guess as to why exec cmd works but exec cgi doesn't
is that exec cmd probably uses less fds than exec cgi.
If you add a few more virtual domains (well, a few more
log files) then you will probably find neither working.
