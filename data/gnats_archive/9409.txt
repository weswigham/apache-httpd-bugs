 *** Christie Welsh to Play ***
 http://www.backofthenet.com
     The U.S. Women's National
 Team's clash with Mexico on Saturday, Jan. 12 at Blackbaud Stadium in
 Charleston, S.C., (7  p.m. ET on ESPN2) will be just the beginning of a
 three-week trek that will take the team across the world to China, where
 they will face Norway, Germany and China in the Four Nations Women's
 Tournament taking place in Guangzhou on January 23, 25 and 27, 2002.
 The team begins training in South Carolina today (Jan. 8), where they
 will remain until Jan. 16 before they depart for China.  The 24-player
 training camp roster was announced in December, and includes a strong
 mix of international veterans and up-and-coming stars.  The camp roster
 will be pared down to an active 18-player roster before the Mexico game
 and then again before the trip to the Far East.
 
 Christie Welsh has replaced Mia
 Hamm on the 24-player training camp roster.  Hamm, who has a lingering injury to her left leg,
 will look to get 100% healthy before taking part in U.S. Women's
 National Team events in February and March and the 2002 WUSA season.
 
 The  excitement continues at The Soccer Coliseum at Teaneck Armory in Teaneck, NJ -- but remaining winter tournaments are filling up fast.  Martin Luther King Tournament (Jan 21) is sold out at all age groups, but the Winter Break Blowout (Feb 18-20) sti ll has some openings.  Ages U8 through U19 enjoy 4 games guaranteed (18 minutes each) on our brand new grass-like indoor surface.  No boards.  No ping-pong.  Real soccer, with touch lines, throw-ins & corner kicks.
    As always, our weekend tournaments sell out, but there are still some openings if you register now.  Visit www.soccercoliseum.com or email info@soccercoliseum.com for information and/or a registration form.
 
   
 
 Come once and see why teams throughout the area make The Soccer Coliseum a "must play" each winter
 
 Just 5 minutes from the GW Bridge.
