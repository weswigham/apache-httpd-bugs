>Environment:
Win32 MS DevStudio 6.0
>Description:
substring_conf() will parse "e:\develo~1\Apache\cgi-bin\" out as e:\develo~1\Apache\cgi-bin".  
Note that the last '\' is replaced with a quote.  This results in the error
script not found or unable to stat: e:/development/apache/cgi-bin"cgictest.EXE.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put quotes around the path for ScriptAlias.  
For example, ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "e:\develo~1\Apache\cgi-bin\"

Now try to run the cgi.
>Fix:
substring_conf() in ../main/util.c (called from ap_getword_conf()) seems
to be the culprit.  When parsing the string "e:\develo~1\Apache\cgi-bin\" 
(quotes are part of the string), it replaces the last '\' with '"'. 
At quick glance,  with only this case in mind,  the following change should 
do the trick:

if (start[i] == '\\' && (start[i + 1] == '\\'
    || (quote && start[i + 1] == quote)))
<<	    *resp++ = start[++i];

State-Changed-Why:

This is not a bug.  Sloshes are used as 'quote the next
character,' so the last slosh is telling Apache to *not*
remove the following character -- which is a quotation
mark.

The problem is that your directive is incorrect.  You
should use slashes, not sloshes, for all paths relating
to Apache.  In other word, the second argument should be
"e:/develo~1/Apache/cgi-bin/".  This is documented at
<http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html> (look for the
string 'slash').

Thanks for the report, though, and for using Apache.
