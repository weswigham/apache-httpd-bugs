>Environment:
Running under IRIX 6.2 using Apache 1.2.5.  Problem with various clients
(MSIE 3.0.2 under Windows 95. Sometimes problem arises with Netscape 3.x
on both the Mac and Win95 clients.
>Description:
With all versions of Apache 1.2.x under IRIX 6.2 (an Iris R4400 Indigo
serving as a multi-homed webserver for my institute), GIF images larger than
say 76KB sometimes fail to download completely.  Setting the various
keepalives settings solved the problem on some clients
                KeepAlive On
                MaxKeepAliveRequests 0

But still under MSIE 3.02 Win95 clients, images sometimes fail to download
completely. The problem occurs only under a fast (ethernet) connection.
Under a dialup connection, images download properly.  The problem is present
on all our MSIE 3.02 clients.
>How-To-Repeat:
The URL for the institute is http://intra.ninds.nih.gov

 What exactly do you mean by fail to download completely?
 
 If you take an image and just access it directly, ie. not from a IMG SRC
 in a page, does it still have the problem?
 
 Does it not finish downloading or is it possible that it is just corrupt? 
 Try saving to disk and comparing the two in size and content.  There are
 known bogons on IRIX 6.2 that completely mess up the damn networking. 
 
 More comments later...

 Hi Marc,
 
 Thank you for responding. The images are proper as they download completely
 and correctly from a Win95/NT4.0 PC running Netscape 4.04.
 
 With MSIE 3.02, they only download part ways and the client thinks it is
 finished.
 
 Before, if we did not change the MaxKeepAliveRequests from the default to 0,
 this behavior happened on almost every Browser (client) for lots of images.
 
 The images just download partly - only a portion of the image is displayed.
 It is a consistent problem on many clients.
 
 It is possibly something to do using IRIX 6.2. I have applied all the patches.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you compiling with -n32 ?  If so, try without, if not,
try with.

What compiler are you using?  If gcc, try cc.  If cc, try
gcc.

Try accessing an image directly, saving it to disk, and
seeing where it is corrupted.  If you want, just send
me a copy of the corrupted one.

 GIF images do not donwload properly. The images either fail to
 download completely or they are corrupted when downloaded.

This is an IRIX bug.  There's a patch for it... it's probably
the most recent TCP/IP rollup... but you should ask your IRIX
rep to be sure.
