State-Changed-Why:
Your compiler is broken.  You are trying to use a
gcc designed for AIX 4.1.4 with AIX 4.2.  You can't do that.
You have to get a version of gcc designed for your version
of your OS.

 Notice you have a version of gcc for a 4.1 machine and you are on an 4.2 machine
 So please install a version of gcc or xlc for your version of AIX
 Thanks for using Apache.
