Nothing special here
>Description:
I spent several hours tracking this bug down.  I have around 200 VirtualHosts.
In one of them there is a line that reads:

TransferLog /cruzio/vr/www.ecservers.com/access_log

Suppose the file "/cruzio/vr/www.ecservers.com/access_log" is a symbolic link
that points to /u/xxx125/logs/access_log.

If the path that "/u/xxx125/logs/access_log" is a bad path, i.e. if the 
directory /u/xxx125 does not exist then httpd will silently crash. 
No error messages in error_log or stderr, stdout.

httpd should detect this condition and report it to the user.  This should not
have taken hours to troubleshoot.

See above

Do an lstat and check the results?
