>Environment:
HP-UX 10.20, any patch level past MR.	
>Description:
When I provided tuning tips for HP-UX 10.20, I failed to mention the specifics
of how to set tcp_hash_size in the kernel disc image. It is critically important
that folks use "W" to write a 32 bit quantity, not "w" to write a 16 bit value
when patching the disc image. 

The tcp_hash_size parm is a 32 bit quantity, and using "w" will put a value into
the _upper_ 16 bits of that value, which will cause it to be larger than the 
machine can take, and the box will panic upon reboot.

>How-To-Repeat:
Simply use the wrong case in the adb command and reboot.
>Fix:
Modify or append the tuning description to include a warning to use "W" instead
of "w." Also, point-out that this particular tune is not applicable to HP-UX
11.X. That release has an entirely different set of tunes - if someone can give
me a proper email address to submit them (I suspect the bug report page is not
it :) I'd be happy to oblige

 We can fix that.  However, we would much prefer if you could write
 everything someone needs to know about tuning HPUX for Apache up on a web
 page and submit that to us, then we can simply replace the existing one
 with that.  
 
 Normally, a "bug report" is the proper way to send such things in; if it
 is not easy to put in the body of the bug report, you can followup with an
 email to apbugs@apache.org with the same subject line or you can give a
 URL for it.
