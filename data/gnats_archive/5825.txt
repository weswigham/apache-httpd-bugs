Compiler egcs-2.91.66
>Description:
I have mass vhosting working well with the following config (extracted from httpd.conf)

<VirtualHost 193.63.247.70>
        VirtualDocumentRoot /home/webs/%1/public_html
</VirtualHost>

I now want to add a script alias to each vhost using VirtualScriptAlias e.g:

<VirtualHost 193.63.247.70>
        VirtualDocumentRoot /home/webs/%1/public_html
        VirtualScriptAlias  /home/webs/%1/cgi-bin
</VirtualHost>

However when trying to run a cgi script on one of the vhosts, I get a 403 Forbidden.

The log file reports:

[Wed Mar  1 12:51:44 2000] [error] [client 193.63.247.66] file permissions deny server execution: /home/webs/cgi-bin/test-cgi

I have confirmed that cgi script and the cgi-bin directory has world execute rights. Notice in the logged error it is missing the %1 directory bit between /home/webs/ and cgi-bin/test-cgi.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure vhosting as above.

URL's are pointless as you just get a 403 returned.
>Fix:
No!

State-Changed-Why:
I can't duplicate this problem. Can you give me a long
lising of your cgi directory and all parent directories,
and tell me what user your web server is running as?
