>Environment:
Precompile apache 1.3 on FreeBSD 2.2.7-RELEASE
>Description:
You specifically ask for compatibilty issues to list in your
compatibility notes page. Since my upgrade of apache just failed
because of this, I thought I should mention it.

My server root is /usr/local. Document Root is /usr/local/www/data
/usr/local/www is a symlink /mnt1/www
This worked with 1.2, but fails with 1.3 in a minimally upgraded
fashion. A similar problem is reported in PR#2636
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Mention it in the 'compatibilty notes' page. Maybe put a link to
a solution there.

 This really isn't due to upgrading Apache, but due to changing your config
 files, which you may happen to do as a part of upgrading Apache.  You
 simply have to set Options FollowSymLinks for that directory.
 
 I guess a note about the default config files being changed may be
 appropriate.

State-Changed-When: Sun Oct 18 13:09:40 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The fact that upgrading your configuration files, in general,
can lead to various changes and that you should pay particular
attention to the Options and AllowOverride settings has
been noted in the upgrading page.
