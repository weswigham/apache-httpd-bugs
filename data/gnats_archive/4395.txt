We are currently using on the server that is experiencing this problem 4.01 BSDi
All the current patches are on this box for BSDI and 
>Description:
There appears to be no problem with HTML being seen it is just CGI.  The server will work just fine for hours and then all the CGI on the server stops working.
There are currently something like 500 domains on that server so it does get a lot of hits.  There are normally 75 to 200 process running for httpd at during the day
There is an average of 10 - 15 scripts executed every minute on that server.  The only way to fix it is to kill the server and restart it.  If you try to do a kill -1 or kill -HUP it does not bring the CGI back to life.
We are currently running all the cgi though cgiwrap.  HOwever cgiwrap is not reporting the error apache is.
		
>How-To-Repeat:
very easily.....  go to www.rosevilleautomall.com and click on the pre-owned button.  It should be dead. If not we noticed the scripts not working again and restarted httpd.  just wait a little while and they will die again.

Nope
