>Organization:
>Environment:
OS/390 UNIX Services, V2.9 IBM CC
>Description:
Ehen I use MSIE to view the page, it shows the korean page, instead of the english one. Netscape works fine.
The problem is the languaje definition. MSIE defines english by default
as "en-us" (English - USA) and Netscape uses the more comon "en".
When I define the language in MSIE as English (en), all works fine again.
I didn't tried this beta in a more native platform (i.e. Linux), and I
don't know if is a porting problem or a general one.


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I solved the problem adding the en-us language mapped to .en, but I suposse apache must map the pre-dash languaje part

See the "Language Subset Selections" section of

which explains that Apache's behaviour in this
case is correctly following the relevant RFC.

Thanks for using Apache!
