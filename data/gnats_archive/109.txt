Digital UNIX 4.0 using DEC's cc. Bug does not appear to be
compiler or environment related.
>Description:
The PATH_TRANSLATED field for an SUexec'd user cgi-bin script
appears to be relative to the server's root document directory.
This directory has nothing whatsoever to do with this query.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.wizlink.net/~davids/test.cgi/z
My home directory is /usr/users/davids and the script is in
public_html/test.cgi from there. But the path_translated is:
PATH_TRANSLATED=/var/www/htdocs/z which is from the server root!
>Fix:
I think the path_translated field should point to the script that
was executed. Alternatively, it could be the parameters after the
script, but relative to the user's public_html directory, not the
server document root

State-Changed-Why:
Fix made. We now check for a valid user directory through
brute force instead of being confused by the password entry.
