If I edit the Configuration file to my requirements, run Configure and compile
apache I get a version that does short status reports rather than full ones
despite description text in the Configuration file that inicates that setting
the line:
Rule STATUS=yes
should cause full status reports to be selected.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I tracked the problem down to the tr command in src/helpers/CutRule.  It
actually appears to be a bug in HP-UX 10.20's version of 'tr' which, when
given the translations you use, outputs some characters with the eighth bit
set rather than the correct lower case letters.

I have searched the HP-UX patch database and cannot find a patch for 'tr'.

I was able to work around it by changing the tr command to use character
classes, i.e. instead of:
    tr "A-Z" "a-z"
I changed it to use:
    tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'

I don't know how portable that construct is but another workaround would be to
supply s simple C program that does the case conversion.

 Can you reproduce it on its own, eg. echo "<some string...>" | tr "A-Z"
 "a-z" ?
 
 A sample case, as simple as possible, would be interesting to see...

 Do you have the LANG environment variable set?
 
 Setting LANG=3DC first does it work right?

 You're right - it is LAN variable sensitive as shown by the
 following shell commands:
 
 rumpus:fosdicsj [402] % echo $LANG
 en_GB.iso88591
 rumpus:fosdicsj [403] % echo "yes" | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"
 =DD=C9=DF
 rumpus:fosdicsj [404] % echo "yes" | env LANG=3DC tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"
 yes
 rumpus:fosdicsj [405] % =
 
 
 -- =
