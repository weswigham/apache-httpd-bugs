>Description:
When using "#include virtual" to include the contents of a cgi script the SCRIPT_NAME environment variable contains extraneous information if the path to the script contains extra information.
>How-To-Repeat:
e.g. try <!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/test-cgi/123" -->
The SCRIPT_NAME environment variable becomes /cgi-bin/test-cgi/123 rather than /cgi-bin/test-cgi which is what we expect. Accessing /cgi-bin/test-cgi/123 produces the expected results.

State-Changed-Why:
I think we (the developers) talked about this once and agreed
this was the right thing to do; mainly because that's How 
Things Had Always Been (tm) and to Change it would be Disruptive.
Or something.  At any rate you have a number of remedies 
available to you: you can simply strip PATH_INFO off ot SCRIPT_NAME,
or you can look at SCRIPT_FILENAME.  Viola.
