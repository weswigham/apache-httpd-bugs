>Description:
Hi,

This is our test system so it really does not get used.
Here is the error_log info....

[Sun Oct 19 21:28:08 1997] httpd: caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[Sun Oct 19 21:28:17 1997] [notice] Apache/1.3b2 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Sun Oct 19 21:28:36 1997] [error] server seems busy, spawning 4 children (you may need to increase StartServers, or Min/MaxSpareServers)
[Sun Oct 19 21:28:37 1997] [error] server seems busy, spawning 8 children (you may need to increase StartServers, or Min/MaxSpareServers)
[Mon Oct 20 00:01:07 1997] [error] server seems busy, spawning 4 children (you may need to increase StartServers, or Min/MaxSpareServers)

The config file has not changed from 1.2.3 which was running prior to this.
*******************************************************************************

Also received an email from another person with a similar problem.
Here is that information as well.....

I experience the same kind of problem as the one you're describing.

I run Apache 1.3b2 on an Alpha Server 8400 under Digital Unix 3.2G,
and after approximately 5-7 Hours, the Web Server continues to 
reply to my requests, but the system "seems" to be hanged.

I can't use the system commands under /bin (linked to /usr/bin) but 
those under /sbin work fine (that's what shows problably the system as 
hanged).

State-Changed-Why:
You didn't say exactly what the problem is.  What do youmean
by "system hangs"?  Are connections to the web server refused?
Do they just hang?  Does the entire system become unresponsive?

Does 1.2.3 work?

We need much more information to be able to say
anything at all.

State-Changed-Why:
Dupe of PR#1274.  Submitting repeated bug reports about
a very vauge problem that results in your being able to
access the server fine will not get you anywhere.  The
web server is working, you say you can access it, so your
monitoring system vendor is the only one who knows how their
code works and what it checks so they can figure out
what they are looking for and not seeing.

 Please do not submit dupe bug reports.  You submitted this once.
 Submitting it again and again will not get you anywhere.
 
 If you can access the system fine but your monitoring software can't, then
 I really don't see what the problem with Apache is or how we can do
 anything; we have no idea what your monitoring system is attempting to do. 
 If your monitoring software can't access it then perhaps it is broken. 
 There are many reasons why it could change between 1.2 and 1.3b2, but very
 few that are caused by anything other than a broken monitoring system.  I
 suggest you contact the vendor of your monitoring system.

 The original one was cancelled and then I received an email
 from someone with the same problem. Figured It was more than
 just me and should be looked at again.
 Oh well.
