>Organization:
>Environment:
HPUX-11
>Description:
The file apr_portable.h says...

/* dso types... */
#if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10) || defined(HPUX11)
typedef shl_t                 apr_os_dso_handle_t;
#elif defined(DRAWIN)
typedef NSModule              apr_os_dso_handle_t;
#else
typedef void *                apr_os_dso_handle_t;
#endif

but on an HP the file /usr/include/dl.h and not been included
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I just bunged in a #include <dl.h> at the top of apr_portable.h, but I don't
suppose that's the correct fix.

State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Sat Aug  4 07:21:47 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This was subsequently fixed.  Your include of #include <dl.h> is fine;
that will be present in the next distribution.
