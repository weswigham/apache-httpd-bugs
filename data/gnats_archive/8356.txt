>Description:
I've configured an Apache service, and I've given Apache "allow server" status in ZoneAlarm.  When I reboot my system, incoming HTTP traffic is blocked by ZoneAlarm.

This is because Apache is starting before ZoneAlarm. Here's what ZoneLabs has to say at http://www.zonelabs.com/services/support_network.htm:

  On occasion applications or services that are configured with server 
  privileges start before ZoneAlarm. In these instances, these 
  applications will not be granted server privilege and ZoneAlarm 
  will block them. To resolve these instances, you will need to 
  quit the application, or service, in question and then start it 
  again.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Yes, I added a DependOnService to Apache's service entry in the registry, to cause it to wait for the ZoneAlarm service (vsmon) to start first.
