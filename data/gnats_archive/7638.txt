Apache 1.3.19 and earlier version; the problem does not depend on OS, etc.
>Description:
If suexec is used with Apache and the suexec log file is erroneously placed in 
a read-only filesystem, the error message of suexec is:

	failed to open log file    	
	fopen: Read-only file system

Error diagnostic would be much improved by changing the first line of 
this error message to
	
	failed to open suexec log file
or
	suexec: failed to open log file

and perhaps adding the logfile name.
>How-To-Repeat:

The following trivial patch will give the desired behaviour:
