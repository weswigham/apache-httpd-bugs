 Is this just a warning or an error?  ie. does it compile and work ok
 otherwise?
 
 Does setting WANTHSREGEX to yes in Configuration help?

 Marc:
 
 	I tried pointing the cc to the local regex.h under "regex/regex.h"  It took that however I got a bunch of warnings and two errors:
 
 (example warning)	w "mod_usertrack.c",L275/C26(#553): word | Conversion of type `char *' to type `unsigned char *' is not ANSI-compliant.
 	
 (errors)			line 997 of "util.c" and line 980 of "util.c" <- I changed these to "unsigned", I hope this is O.K.
 	
 I fixed the two errors above by changing the function to from "const char" to "unsigned" - this took care of the errors. So once the compilation was complete, the linker bombed with the following error:
 
 cc    -o httpd alloc.o http_main.o http_core.o http_config.o http_request.o  http_log.o htt

 Help Marc!

 Don't have time to look at thatright now.  I will comment more later if
 anything is messed up above.

 Looks like you messed up when editing one of the configuration files.
 The IBS looks like the tail end of a LIBS define from somewhere that got
 messed up.  Can't really guess where from here...
 
 As always, if we can get a temporary login on the box we can probably make
 the changes necessary to Apache to make it compile out of the box on the
 system when someone gets time.
