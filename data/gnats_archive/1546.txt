Sequent Dynix/ptx v2.1.6. UNAME -A returns "starpas starpas 3.2.0 V2.1.6 i386"; using cc to compile Apache 1.2.4
>Description:
This is a configuration problem, and YES, I know the web page said not to
submit them through here, but I sent an email and Brian Behlendorf asked me
to submit this as a bug.  I am trying to compile for a Sequent system, and 
modified the Configure script and conf.h according to the PORTING guidelines.  
Unfortunately, every time I run "make" I get the following errors:
$ make
        cc -c -Iregex  -O2 -D_SEQUENT_   alloc.c
        cc -c -Iregex  -O2 -D_SEQUENT_   http_main.c                            "

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have looked through all your bug and error databases.  I found two 
relevant PR #'s: In PR#195 you told the submitter that Apache has been 
ported successfully to Sequent, but in PR#962 you reverse yourself and tell
the submitter that you had not ported to Sequent, but were willing to do so
if the submitter (who worked for Sequent) was willing to provide you access 
to a Sequent machine.  If you have since completed the port, please provide the 
necessary changes to the Configure and/or conf.h files.

We've successfully built it on a dynix/ptx system once, way back
some time.  But I guess it doesn't work anymore.  Looks like you
need to provide a definition for JMP_BUF in conf.h... have you
created a _SEQUENT_ section in conf.h yet?

Dean

P.S. sequent never did provide us with access to a machine to do
the port.

 Adding the JMP_BUF into conf.h got me a lot further, but I'm still not quite
 there yet.
 
 Here are the changes I've made.  In the Configure script, I added the
 following lines between the *-isc4*) definition and the *-sco3*) definition:
 
 *-*-starpas*)
   OS='Sequent Dynix/ptx'
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -D_SEQUENT_"
   DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes
   ;;
 
 In conf.h, I added the following lines right after the "typedef" line at the
 end of the PARAGON definition:
 
 #elif defined(SEQUENT) || defined(_SEQUENT_)
 #define NO_KILLPG
 #define NEED_STRCASECMP
 #define NEED_STRNCASECMP
 #define HAVE_MMAP
 #define HAVE_SHMGET
 #define HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H
 #define HAVE_SHMGET
 #define HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H
 #define JMP_BUF sigjmp_buf
 
 When I do the 'Configure' and 'make', I get the following results:

 Add -lsocket, read the man page for "gethostbyname" and "getpeername" to
 find out what if any other library they require.
 
 initgroups -- you may need to define NEED_INITGROUPS
 
 writev -- you may need to define NO_WRITEV, but do a "man writev" first,
 since it could be hidden off in some library you need to link in
 
 Generally just go through the man pages for each of those functions until
 you find all the libraries you can.

 Dean,
 
 Just wanted you to know that I am making progress.  Studying the man
 pages and adding the libraries as includes in the conf.h file have cleared
 up all the original errors, but now I have some new ones.  I appreciate
 how fast you replied to my message the other day.  Unfortunately, things
 are getting hectic here with the year-end.  I'll keep you posted.

 Ok you should probably start trying to disable the setsockopt() calls in
 http_main.c and see if any of those are hurting things. 
 
 Actually before trying that, try using -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT, if
 that don't work try USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT, or maybe even
 USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.  If none of these works, try running
 "./httpd -X" to get a single child version, maybe something is wrong
 across the fork.  -X isn't good for a production system, but it'll give
 good hints.
 
 Then start disabling the setsockopt() calls if you haven't had any luck so
 far.
 
 At some point you may need to find out what the httpd parent and children
 are doing... the command for this is called strace, or truss, or ktrace,
 or par... it varies.  See
 <http://www.cryptsoft.com/~tjh/tools/syscall.html>. 
 
 You only need one of HAVE_MMAP or HAVE_SHMGET -- I forget which one
 overrides the other.  You may want to try USE_MMAP_FILES when you get
 other things working. 
 
 Which version of Dynix/ptx are you using?  My mud used to run on version
 3.2 I think it was... but I can't seem to find any special cases in my
 code for ptx.
