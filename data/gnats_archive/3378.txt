OS: AIX 4.2
cc: C for AIX Compiler version 3
>Description:
I ran ./configure --enable-module=throttle --enable-module=rewrite --enable-module=info --enable-module=usertrack
It reported no errors.
I did /usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start
The system reported:
exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program /usr/local/apache/sbin/httpd because of the following errors:
        0509-029 Alignment of text does not match required alignment.
        0509-025 The /usr/local/apache/sbin/httpd file is not executable or not in correct XCOFF format.
        0509-026 System error: Cannot run a file that does not have a valid format.
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

State-Changed-Why:
Since we have seen a number of error with the IBM compiler
as of late could you please let us know what version of the
compiler you are using?  Which version of c for AIX 3.6.4
and is it VAC or xlC, but either way it sounds like an compiler
problem and not an Apache problem.

Thanks for using Apache.

 sorry I was a little unclear....
 
 Is it VAC ( Visual Age C ) for AIX or xlC 3.6.4 for
 AIX.
 
 do an lslpp -L all | grep xlC and this will tell you the version
 of xlC
 Also what happens is you compile with gcc?
