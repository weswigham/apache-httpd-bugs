>Description:
I'm using apache with the mod_proxy module and the following access control(s):                                                                                
                                                          
<IfModule mod_proxy.c>                                                          
<Directory proxy:*>                                                             
order deny,allow                                                                
deny from all                                                                   
allow from 127.0.0.1 139.25.113.10 192.168.123.1                                
#allow from 139.25.112.104                                                      
</Directory>                                                                    
</IfModule>                                                                      

Then I try to access http://www.geocities.com/ from the host 139.25.112.104                                                      
and get (correctly):

[Thu Mar 27 17:06:54 1997] access to proxy:http://www.geocities.com/ failed for pgtd0119, reason: Client denied by server configuration
pgtd0119 unknown - [27/Mar/1997:17:16:42 +0100] "GET http://www.geocities.com/ HTTP/1.0" 403 1089

But when I send a second request http://www.geocities.com/foo.bar
then the server passes the request to www.geocities.com, i.e., 
it performs the proxy service that should be disallowed:

pgtd0119 unknown - [27/Mar/1997:17:16:53 +0100] "GET http://www.geocities.com/foo.bar HTTP/1.0" 404 1064                                                      
                                                          
BTW: It would be nice if proxy (or any) access could be limited on host+path                                                          
level, not just host level.

Use a <Files> block instead of a <Directory> block to

this.
