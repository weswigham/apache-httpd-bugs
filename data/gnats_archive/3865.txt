>Description:
given: ScriptAlias /env/ /var/www/cgi-bin/envshow/catalog/
the CGI script gets SCRIPT_NAME=/env
where under NCSA (which we are converting from)
the CGI script gets SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/envshow
(which I would argue is correct)

The reason this is important is so I can reconstruct a valid URL
for a redirect by concatenating SERVER_NAME[:SERVER_PORT]SCRIPT_NAME PATH_INFO

     Why?  It was my understanding that Apache was 'compatible'
     with the old NCSA server -- and that's what it does.
 
     the ScriptAlias causes the translation:
 
      /env/<whatever>   -=>  /var/www/cgi-bin/envshow/catalog/<whatever>
 
     then it (NCSA) separates that into:
 
          /var/www    /cgi-bin/envshow  /catalog/<whatever>
          <docroot>   SCRIPT_NAME       PATH_INFO
 
     possibly because of <Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin"> ...

 Why should /cgi-bin/envshow be in there at all?  There is no
 URL with that name based on your ScriptAlias directive.
 If you have some other directive that makes such a URL valid,
 fine, but there is no reason Apache should randomly pick
 some other path to use...
