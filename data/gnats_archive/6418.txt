>Description:
This patch adds functionality to log the contents of any specified cookie in a
LogFormat directive.  This is useful for sites that use cookie auth and would
like to still log the username, or for logging a paticular tracking cookie. (or
both - mod_usertrack does not allow this). The patch is located at 
http://torgo.978.org/~threshar/cookie_var.patch.gz (against 1.3.12).  
>How-To-Repeat:
Logformat "%{username}c \"%r\" ${trackingcookie}" will log contents of the 
'username' cookie, the request, and the contents of 'trackingcookie' - Documented
in the patch as well.

N/A
