>Organization:
>Environment:
NT server v4.0 sp6.0a
Apache 1.3.14
>Description:
We have a web page at http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/docs/user-ref.pdf which appears to function fine when opened using Netscape navigator but which simply hangs when viewed from IE5.5.
The same file when served by apache 1.3.12 works fine in both IE and netscape.
>How-To-Repeat:
I think if you try to access http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/docs/user-ref.pdf from IE5.5 you should see very similar behaviour. I.e. the browser tries to open the file but always hangs.
>Fix:
If you do the same thing from Netscape it appears to function fine.
