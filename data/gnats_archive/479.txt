When passing a query string to a cgi script, apache passwd the username with

This is the error returned by suEXEC:

  invalid target user name: (\~amundson)

Here's what haha.cgi looks like:

	#!/opt/gnu/bin/perl

	print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
	print "hello";

>How-To-Repeat:
Works:
http://www.cs.umn.edu/~amundson/haha.cgi

Doesn't work:
http://www.cs.umn.edu/~amundson/haha.cgi?foo

Works:
http://www.cs.umn.edu/~amundson/haha.cgi?foo=bar

I'd wager this too was fixed by 1.2b9... which is in the usual
places.  Could you tell us if it does fix the problem?

Thanks

Hey Mark, I think you told me this was fixed.  If not just
drop a line and we'll re-open.
