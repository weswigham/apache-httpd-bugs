>Description:
If one creates a IP less virtual host and adds a ServerPath /www.domain.com
so old clients should be able to use http://www.domain.com/www.domain.com
then (at least I) one can expect from the documentation that an old client's
request of the form http://www.domain.com/www.domain.com/X and a new client's
http://www.domain.com/X should be equal but this isn't true it seems. If
the virtualdomain entry contains ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /home/user/cgi-bin and
DocumentRoot /home/user/www then
http://www.domain.com/www.domain.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi doesn't work for an old
client but http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi works for a new client.

When I inspect my custom log I see that the virtual domain is correct 
(test.hogia.net) but it says that the user was accessing /test.hogia.net/
when an old client tried: http://test.hogia.net/test.hogia.net/

What should I do to make this work correctly? Use mod_redirect somehow to rewrite
test.hogia.net/ into / for clients that don't set the Host header?
Would that fix the logfiles as well?

Here is my entry:
<VirtualHost test.hogia.net>
User sa
Group staff
ServerAdmin sa@hogia.net
DocumentRoot /home/sa/html
ServerName test.hogia.net
ServerPath /test.hogia.net
CustomLog /home/sa/logs/test.custom "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b"
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/sa/cgi-bin/
Alias /error_htmls /etc/httpd/htdocs/error_htmls
</VirtualHost>
>How-To-Repeat:
http://test.hogia.net/test.hogia.net/ is basically the same as the above
but without User and Group most of the time. There is a cgi-bin/test.cgi
script there as well.
>Fix:
Either update the documentation or (better) fix the code so the server path
part is removed from the URL

State-Changed-Why:
ServerPath only intercepts and alters requests that are under
the DocumentRoot, although it correctly identifies the server
in all cases.

To make your setup work correctly, you need to add the
following to the virtual host configuration:

ScriptAlias /test.hogia.net/cgi-bin/ /home/sa/cgi-bin/

 Yes, but consider redirects. If the server blindly rewrote
 /serverpath/path to /path, and it needed at some point down the line to
 send a redirect, it wouldn't have any way to know to redirect it,
 actually, to /servetpath/path. So the code only does the automatic
 munching for "core" files (DocumentRoot-based).
 
 We went through all this when the ServerPath code was originally written,
 and decided that this was basically the best workable solution.
