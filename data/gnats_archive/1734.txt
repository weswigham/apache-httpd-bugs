State-Changed-Why:
Erm... why do you think the third argument is supposed
to be q request_rec?

mod_imap.c:     return construct_url(r->pool, r->uri, r->server);
mod_imap.c:     return construct_url(r->pool, "/", r->server);
util.c:char *construct_url(pool *p, const char *uri, const server_rec *s) {

I fail to see the problem...

State-Changed-When: Sat Feb 14 02:03:04 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is likely due to applying SSL patches which change the
prototype of construct_url().   You'll have to get updated
SSL patches.

Thanks for using Apache!
