>Description:
mod_proxy has a ProxyPass feature, which is a very useful thing.
I need to ProxyPass content from Microsoft IIS server.
IIS sends a header (Content-Location), which I want to remove.
mod_headers feature of removing specific headers does not remove headers from ProxyPass requests.
I would like to see an featre to remove or modify (like ProxyPassRevers) that Content-Location header, which IIS adds to some requests.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
to make ProxyPass contents flow through mod_headers header removal process.
(currently it does not help if I configure header unset Content-Location)
