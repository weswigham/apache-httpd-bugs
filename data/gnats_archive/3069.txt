Linux popsmart.ots.dk 2.0.29 #1 Tue Feb 11 20:36:48 MET 1997 i586
>Description:
When I create a Perl-cgi-script on the Linuz-Apache server it works just
fine, but if the script was created on a PC (WINdoze) and transferred it
won't work I get an:"Premature end of script headers" error, the script
runs just fine in commandline but it won't work through the server, I
have a hunch that this is caused by 'newline/carriagereturn' differences
between Linux and win, but since it works in Linux commandline ('%perl
script') I should think it was possible to get it to run, what do I do?

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.popsmart.dk/cgi-bin/newtest (made on win95 doesnt work)
http://www.popsmart.dk/cgi-bin/newtest2 (pasted in vi works)
>Fix:
As I mentioned I guess it's something with win/unix linefeed/carriagereturn differences

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Sep 24 16:23:26 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
First, we can not support 1.1.1 any more since it is ancient.

Second, this is not an appropriate quesiton for a "bug report".
Please use the procedures detailed as alternatives on the page
before you submit your report, eg. Usenet.

We can not give basic user support to millions of users.
If your problem is caused by lack of line ending translation,
then you should be sure to transfer the file with ftp in
ascii mode or load it up in the pico editor after transferring
and then save it to disk.

However, you really need to ask in somewhere such as Usenet
since this is not an appropriate place.

   Sorry, I just couldn't find anyplace else, and the description i the FAQ wasn't
 really usefull, btw. the only usegroup I've been able to find dealing directly with
 apache is japan.www.server.apache but tjis isn't too active and most of the content
 is in Japanese (but I did post the problem).
 
 anyway thanks
