(Not a "real" problem, per se, but I guess it fits in this framework.)
Apache currently has no way to start up without detaching for normal
operation.  (-X makes it possible, but in a way that's not supposed to be used for
non-debugging purposes).  By providing a command-line switch to not detach
the main process, it would be much easier to watch and govern the running of apache with specialized tools.
For the worst example, init comes to mind, or a better example is djb's
svc/supervise from ftp://koobera.math.uic.edu/www/daemontools.html.  They could
be used to provide non-root access (operator/developer group, controlled by filesystem level access to a directory) to start/stop/restart/signal apache, which seems to be an often wanted feature.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I can't believe it hasn't been already rehashed, but can't find any trace of it
in the FAQ, nor in the bugs database.  I can come up with a patch if this
is a feature which would be accepted if it requires no efforts from your
side. :)  Willing to provide even docs on how to get it to work with daemontools.

 1.3 is in feature freeze... but if you want to work this out that's cool.
 If you resubmit the patch after 1.3.0 is released it stands a better
 chance of being incorporated.

 Ok, I guess I am few months too late, but I just got around to the
 apache updating game now...  I think I managed to do it as cleanly as
 possible; without of course affecting users who don't know about it.
 
 So here's it, the essence of the change is very-very small; just making
 http_main.c detach() not if !one_process, but if !no_detach, and
 creating a new '-n' option to do just that, and for a bit more
 streamlining, making '-X' set one_process AND this new no_detach
 variable.  And of course updating all the getopt calls in there, and
 updating both the manual page, and the html docs to describe briefly
 what '-n' does.
 
 [Just an aside, most programs which can do a no-detach start, usually do
 that on '-f', but it's not available.  A few more programs use -n (the
 Linux klogd/syslogd, and amd IIRC), so I settled for that.]

 Ok, I've put a new version of the patch at:
 
 http://eon.ml.org/dist/diffs/apache-1.3.x-nodetach-2.diff.gz
 
 (In order to not waste storage here, I did not include it; however, feel
 free to tell me it's better be here, or request it via email.)
 
 It's changed a bit, I modified detach() to take an argument which makes
 it fork() or not fork().

State-Changed-Why:
This feature has been added to the Apache 2.0 cvs repository.
It will be available in the next 2.0 alpha release and in all
subsequent releases.  Apache will not detach from the controlling
terminal if the environment variable NO_DETACH is set to 1.

Thank you for the bug report.
