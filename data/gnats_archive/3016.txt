>Description:
I found some bugs in Apache manual page.

- "(Apache 1.2)" should be deleted from Syntax of Include.
- There should be <HR> between NameVirtualHost and Options.
- There should be <HR> between ServerType and StartServers.
- Syntax of <VirtualHost> is wrong. "..." after [:port] should be deleted.
- There isn't "]" after status in Syntax of <RedirectMatch>.
- s/AuthDbmGroupFile/AuthDBMGroupFile/
- There are many "mime-" and "MIME-" and I feel they lack unity (especially mod_autoindex).

State-Changed-Why:

Thanks for pointing these out.  Where they identified
actual inaccuracies, corrections have been applied.  In
the future it would be helpful if you would include the
name of the page on which you found each error.

What makes you think the <VirtualHost> syntax is wrong?
"<VirtualHost 10.0.0.1:80 10.0.0.2:8080>" is perfectly
valid.
