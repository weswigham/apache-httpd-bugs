>Description:
Cannot load the tomcat connection module. I've put the ApacheModuleJServ.dll in the modules directory. When starting apache from the command prompt I get the following:

E:\apache\Apache2\bin>apache -n apache2 -k start
Syntax error on line 8 of E:/apache/Apache2/conf/tomcat-apache.conf:
Cannot load E:/apache/Apache2/modules/ApacheModuleJServ.dll into server: The specified module could not be found.

My tomcat.conf has the following on line 8:

LoadModule jserv_module modules/ApacheModuleJServ.dll

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: jerenkrantz
State-Changed-When: Wed Feb 27 08:55:30 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
This looks like you are trying to use an Apache 1.3
module with an Apache 2.0 module.  This will not
work.

There are several Tomcat modules available for Apache
2.0.  mod_jk and mod_webapp both have Apache 2.0 modules
available.

Please report any further Tomcat connector bugs at the
appropriate location:

http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html

This bug will be closed.

Thanks,
Justin Erenkrantz
