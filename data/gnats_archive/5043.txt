>Environment:
Just installed Apache  an hour ago on Windows 95 machine.
>Description:
 Instructions talked about TCP/IP set-up but did not mention DNS. Apache would not run without DNS with an early release of Win95. 
>How-To-Repeat:
install under win95, and 98 
>Fix:
You may want to  add instructions to use DNS in your Win95 and Win98 setup instructions. I'll try this with win NT running a proxyserver next am. Thanks
