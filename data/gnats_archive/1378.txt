>Fix:
The problem is caused by character buffers in sub_canonical_filename and os_canonical_filename in \os\win32\util_win32.c being too small.  Changing their size from _MAX_PATH to HUGE_STRING_LENGTH appears to fix the problem.

In the same area, inserting the following lines at the beginning of sub_canonical_filename appears to fix problems 1265 and 1315:
    if (strncmp(szFile, "proxy:", 6) == 0)
    {
	strcpy (szCanon, szFile);
	return;
    }
