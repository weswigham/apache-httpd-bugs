>Description:
At seemingly random intervals, clients receive error messages like:
Connection reset by peer
or certain parts of web pages fail to load (eg: 20% of images load, the rest show broken images). The server error logs show no indication of what's going on, and it is nowhere near being overloaded with around 8 requests/second and .0131% CPU load
>How-To-Repeat:
Due to the seemingly random nature of the problem, it is a bit difficult to reproduce. You can try: http://partyman.qc.ca
to see if you can reproduce it.
>Fix:
From what I've been able to gather, I believe this is either a problem with glibc 2.1 or openssl. I have a few servers setup with libc5 which have never had so much as a hiccup, and I've had a few problems with different software packages and glibc 2.1

 After further investigation, I have found the following:
 
 I have tested the same setup on a machine running libc5,
 and found the same problem. It seems to be some kind
 of speed condition. It does not occur with fast internet
 connections, yet it occurs quite frequently with slower
 connections. I suspect it also has something to do
 with mod_ssl, I will test this further.
