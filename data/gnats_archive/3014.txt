State-Changed-Why:

1. We don't support Apache on Windows 95.  If it works there,
   great; if it doesn't, oh well.  Just so you know.
2. Please use the version numbers as published; "1.3.1" not
   "1.31".
3. When posting bug reports, please give a meaningful
   synopsis, and not just a reference to another report.
4. Try changing the "Alias /cdrom d:/" to "Alias /cdrom/ d:/"
   and see if that makes a difference.

 1. It's nice to know that you provide a half assed program, and will not 
 support it.  Thanks for the info I will uninstall your "unsupported 
 program".
 
 2.  Have you ever forgot to press a key?  But thanks...I think you 
 understood the version.
 
 3.  I just gave a reference to another report to save processing time as 
 PR#1558 fully gave details to the same problem.
 
 4.  I tried all combinations, and you definatly have a MAJOR problem 
 with drive references.
 
 Thanks for releasing an unsupported version on win-32.
 Jason K.
 
 P.S. I hope others read this, and refuse to use Apache on a win-32 
 platform.

If you made the change from "/cdrom" to "/cdrom/" and
it's still not working, then yes, there is a problem.

 Ken;
 
 Yes, I have tried all combinations of /'s vs. no /'s.
 
 What is Win95 missing that you don't feel comfortable supporting it?
 This is the first I've heard that apache was not being supported on 
 Win95.
 
 If you need someone to, I would like to test the new version before you 
 release it.  I would really like to see the directories working on 
 win95, and I imagine this is affecting NT also.
 
 Your remarks to "grow up" are very unprofessional, and undeserving.
 
 An example of why I made those comments are:  If Norton decided not to 
 support Norton Utilities on Win95 because they didn't feel confident in 
 it, then who is going to install it?
 
 "And I hope you grow up and try being one of two dozen people trying
 to support a common code base on over 160 operating systems used
 by millions of people.  In your spare time."  
 
 What version of C do you recommend on a win-32 system. I have MS Visual 
 C++ 5.0.  If Apache can be compiled on it, then I would be more than 
 glad to help the 2 dozen people when/where I could."
 
 Jason
 
 P.S. Let me know if you want someone to test the new release on Win95.

[response from submitter]

Yes I have tried /'s, and no /'s, been through all the combinations I 
could think of.  And it still doesn't reference it properly.

Tks,
Jason

Comment-Added:

One of the Win32 developers has indicated that this is a
known problem, and a correction is in development.  It's
unclear whether the fix will make it into the next release,
but in the meantime a possible workaround is described in
PE#2953.

Comment-Added:

I cannot reproduce your problem in Apache 1.3.12.

I regularly alias several different drives, please test
and reply if you are still having difficulties with this.

Note that the syntax of all Alias like commands is:

Alias /somewhere d:/there   -or-
Alias /somewhere/ d:/there/

note that trailing slashes indicate the path -must-
be terminated, in the second example server.com/somewhere
would get you nowhere.
