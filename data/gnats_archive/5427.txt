Creating Makefile in src/modules/standard

Looks ok, but it doesn't actually include mod_so to be built
# grep OBJS src/modules/standard/Makefile
OBJS=mod_env.o mod_log_config.o mod_mime.o mod_negotiation.o mod_status.o mod_include.o mod_autoindex.o mod_dir.o mod_cgi.o mod_asis.o mod_imap.o mod_actions.o mod_userdir.o mod_alias.o mod_access.o mod_auth.o mod_setenvif.o 

And, of course, mod_so doesn't get included in the finished product

# /usr/local/apachetest/bin/httpd -l
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c

 Please read the documentation more carefully. SHARED_CORE has nothing to do
 with mod_so. SHARED_CORE is just a way to built the core (not any module) of
 Apache into a shared library.
