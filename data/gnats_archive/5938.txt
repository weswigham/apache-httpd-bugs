Solaris (SunOS 5.6 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-250)
gcc 2.95.2
using mod_ssl-2.6.2-1.3.12
>Description:
I put the named virtual hosts in the config file, and server-info shows them,
but the server does not serve from the correct DocumentRoot.  The server
seems to want to have a main server, outside the virtual hosts section;
when I set up three access logs for the two virtual hosts and one in the
main body, all attempts to access virutal hosts get logged in the main
access log file.
