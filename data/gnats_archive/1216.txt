>Description:
Basically, go to http://pascal.reisys.com and link off anything in the left frame.  Hit
the reload button.  The target page on the right should reload, but it defaults
back to the main.  I tried this on Netscape Enterprise server, and it works fine.

There was a similar issue in the bugs database, but no solution seemed to work.
Please inform.
>How-To-Repeat:
Goto http://pascal.reisys.com/ and link from the left frame.  Hit reload.  You will see.
Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
First off, when we ask what release we are using we mean
what release you are using.  You are _NOT_ using the "latest"
source.

This has nothing to do with Apache; the client reloads
the pages according to how they want to based on what
your HTML code is.  Apache has zero control over it.
This is a client issue; we can't support Navigator or any
other client.

 No it is not.  It is the latest release non-beta version. That does not
 mean the latest version.  "latest" has no meaning. 
 
 The latest version is the CVS tree as of right now.  That changes daily.
 Trying to figure out what someone means by "latest" isn't worth the
 hassle.

 It could be a configuration issue if you have your pages setup to not be
 cached when retreived from your Apache server, but that is a configuration
 issue and, as the bug report form clearly states, we can't deal with every
 configuration question from 600000 users.
 
 Perhaps you have your pages setup to be parsed as SSIs with mod_include?
 That means that no Last-Modified header is sent which means that the
 client has to reload them.  What it does when it does that is up to it.
 It is not a problem with Apache.

 Then give a URL for that server.

 You could read the documentation and look at what XBitHack full
 and the group execute bit does; you can make Apache lie by 
 setting that.
