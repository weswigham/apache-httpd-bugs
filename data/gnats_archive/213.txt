>Description:
Accessing a virtual host (e.g. www.virtual.de) from a computer in the local net 
(e.g. host.real.de) results in a log file entry giving the name of the virtual 
host (www.virtual.de) as remote host.
This is not the case when the real server (e.g. www.real.de) is accessed from 
the same host. Then the actual name (host.real.de) is found in the logfile.
For logging both use the same entry in httpd.conf like this:
ServerName www.real.de
CustomLog path_real/access.log "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b %{Cookie}i"
<VirtualHost www.virtual.de:80>
CustomLog path_virtual/access.log "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b %{Cookie}i"
</VirtualHost>

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure this is from any host on the LAN, or are
you accessing from the webserver itself?  Linux will always
use the "nearest" address when given a chance, and if you're
accessing from the webserver itself, that nearest address is
the same as the vhost.  If this is truly a problem from the LAN
then please send your httpd.conf and output of "ifconfig".

Thanks

 Can someone else look at this?  I suspect it's not apache's fault at all.

 Thanks for your reply and sorry for not answering earlier.
 
 To answer your question: it was an access from another host in the LAN.
 
 Meanwhile I found out that the effect described is resulting from a 
 combination of 
 tools: Apache (we have b10 now and can reproduce the effect), the CERN 
 server (v3.0) configured as local proxy only and Netscape 
 3.01, all on Linux. As the proxy capability of Apache was always reported 
 as not being too stable we use the CERN httpd instead.
 
 The situation is as follows:
 The cern_httpd has a configuration entry 'no_proxy' with a list behind it 
 for domains not to be caught via proxy.
 Netscape has in its manual proxy config section an entry 'No proxy for' 
 where a similar list can be put into.
 These to sections are not the same (an entry xyz.de is in the cern list 
 but missing in the Netscape list) and then this virtual server www.xyz.de 
 is reported to be the accessing client in the log file of this virtual 
 server.
 
 Does this help explaining the problem or do you still need configuration 
 infos?
 
 BTW, thanx for Apache to all of you!

 Dirk

 But is the CERN proxy running on the same machine as the Apache server? 
 If so, then the real access to the web site is being done from the CERN
 proxy running on the server, and what Dean writes above holds true; this
 is the way most Unixes work.
