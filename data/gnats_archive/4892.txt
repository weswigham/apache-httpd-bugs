[Comment from PR 4894]
Examined the shortcut installed as a menu entry within
Start->Programs->Apache Web Server->Install as a Service:

The shortcut is not pointing to anything and is infact null.  The installation
appears to fail just after the notice asking about the read-me and presenting the 
"Finish" button.  Reliably.
]How-To-Repeat:
Run the win32 1.3.9 install
]Fix:
Fix the null pointer, the uninitialized variable?  Other than that, you would know 
far better than I would

 Installed 1.3.12.
 Installation Appeared Normal but, found it would not initialize apache
 service.
 Using NT4 Server (I386 - SP6a)
 Re installed 1.3.6 This version works flawlessly.
