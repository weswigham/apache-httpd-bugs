>Description:
I have a setup where I have two subdirectories of my cgi-bin directory each
with .htaccess files.  The two .htaccess files have the same AuthUserFile, and
AuthType, but different AuthNames.  (The idea is to let a person log in as
two different users simultaneously.)

I found that under some circumstances, a user who has authenticated for one
subdirectory does not get asked to reauthenticate when he accesses programs
in the other subdirectory.  My guess is that this has to do with a Location
redirect from the parent directory during the first authentication maybe
causing Apache to associate the AuthName with the parent directory instead
of the subdirectory.
>How-To-Repeat:
I spent some time generating simple programs that reproduce the same bug I
first hit in my complex program.  I'm not on a publically accessible server,
but it's easy enough to set up.  Here's how it goes:

- Create two subdirectories under cgi-bin.  Mine are called "pw" and "adm".
- Stick a copy of the "printenv" cgi program distributed with Apache in each
  directory.
- Create a .htaccess file in each directory.  Mine look like:

   AuthUserFile <path-name>
   AuthGroupFile /dev/null
   AuthName PWDIR
   AuthType Basic

   <Limit GET POST PUT>
   require valid-user
   </Limit> 

 - Edit the .htaccess file in the "adm" subdirectory to have a different
   AuthName, say "ADMDIR", but leave it with the same AuthUserFile.
 - Create the AuthUserFile with at least one user in it.

At this point, you should be able to hit "cgi-bin/pw/printenv", authenticate
for that, and then hit "cgi-bin/adm/printenv" and be asked to reauthenticate.
Everything cool so far.

 - Install the following script in the parent cgi-bin directory, calling it
   "redirect":

    #!/bin/csh
    echo "Content-type: text/html"
    echo "Location: /cgi-bin/pw/printenv"
    echo ""

Now we are all set up.  Here's the sequence of events that causes problems:
 - Exit your browser and start a fresh one.
 - Hit the "/cgi-bin/redirect" page.  You will be asked for a login and
   password.  Give them.  This runs cgi-bin/pw/printenv and works fine.
 - Now hit "/cgi-bin/adm/printenv".  This should ask for authentication, but
   it doesn't.  It happily runs the script without reauthenticating.

If the location redirect in the "redirect" script is done as
   Location: pw/printenv
instead of
   Location: /cgi-bin/pw/printenv
this seems to work OK.

Luckily it seems only the AuthName that it gets confused about.  If the
second .htaccess file has a different AuthUserFile, it still looks in the
right AuthUserFile on the second hit.

If you have any trouble reproducing this, let me know.  I can probably put it
somewhere public.

Nope.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Mon Mar  8 15:13:13 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
It is the browser that is mis-guessing about when to send
the cached auth info, not the server.  The server has no
way to know what realm the client thinks its authentication
info is for and not knowing doesn't compromise security.
It simply means that if the client sends the right authentication
info, then it may or may not have had it cached from a different
realm.
