>Description:
I found that using the ErrorDocument directive in httpd.conf as follows:

ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html

results in the missing.html displaying only the FIRST time a page is accessed that does not live on the server. For some reason, every time a "non-page" is accessed after this point, you get the standard 404 error message. 

Changing the directive to something like the following:

ErrorDocument 404 http://blah.com/missing.html

works - even though the missing.html file is on the local, not remote server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use ErrorDocument directive with a relative path to the document.
>Fix:
Use ErrorDocument directive with full path to the document.

State-Changed-Why:

I strongly suspect that this is a client issue, and
not a server issue.  Can you recreate this behaviour
with different clients, or by using "telnet" to
request the pages from the server?  Apache has
no concept of whether or not a request is the "first"
one, so it cannot have different behaviour of
first and later requests.

 It appears as though it only happens on IE 5.X and up...I tested on 6
 separate client machines and this behavior was duplicated on all of them.
 Netscape browsers and older IE browsers did not display this problem.

Confirmed that this is a client issue, not a server
issue.  If you think you have found a bug with MSIE,
I encourage you to report it to Microsoft.
Thanks for using Apache!
