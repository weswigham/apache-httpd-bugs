>Description:
Authentication via DBM files seems to be broken for GDBM.  I have seen other
such problems reported on the list, so it's not just me.

Pertinent files follow:

.htaccess (from the /usr/local/apache/htdocs/ dir):

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Vertigo Apache Server"
AuthDBMUserFile /usr/local/apache/user_db
AuthDBMGroupFile /usr/local/apache/group_db

<Limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</Limit>

ls -l from /usr/local/apache:

Error snippet from Apache Error Log:

[Wed Apr  1 15:53:26 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: could not open 
dbm auth file: /usr/local/apache/user_db

>How-To-Repeat:
Get a copy of Debian Linux 2.0, install, then grab the source for Apache 1.3b5
and compile.  Voila!
>Fix:
I imagine this has something to do with incompatibilities between libgdbm and 
the mod_auth_dbm module.

As dbmmanage works just fine to create, view, update, etc.. the file, I can't
begin to speculate on where the exact problem is.

Oh, and to answer the questions you've already asked others.

I have tried both with and without AuthDBMAuthoritative, I have made sure my
paths were correct, and have specified -lgdbm as the only extra library to
include in the Configuration file.
