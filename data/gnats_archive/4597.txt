Linux xxx.xxxxx.com 2.2.3 #2 SMP Tue Mar 23 15:49:46 GMT 1999 i686 unknown
Redhat 5.2
perl, version 5.005_02 built for i386-linux
apache_1.3.6 port 8080 + 443
apache-1.3.3-1 port 80
mod_ssl-2.3.3-1.3.6
openssl-0.9.3a
>Description:
Installed RH5.2 full.
Installed SMP Kernel v 2.2.3
Apache 1.3.3 runs fine.
Install apache mod_ssl as detailed in http://www.modssl.org/example/ on test system. Works fine.
Installed Apache mod_ssl on this system, seems fine for ssl and standard.
As this is production system, I need to keep the old apache running untill the new apache is ok.
I changed the document root to /home/httpd/html
After accessing ok with https about 3 or 4 times, netscape reports data error.
now apache 1.3.6 will not start.
I removed /usr/local/apache then re installed. 
It worked until i changed the doc root and accessed  3-4 times then failed in the same way.
It will not start with or without ssl.
To start:
[root@online logs]# ../bin/apachectl start
../bin/apachectl start: httpd started
but does not actually run.

I cant get apache back up now even with the original conf file. The only way to get it back is to re-install.

 It seems a more simple problem than before:
 
 Fresh install, https works ok.
 After restart using:
 [root@online apache]# ./bin/apachectl restart
 ./bin/apachectl restart: httpd restarted
 
 Netscape will report :
 A network error occourred while Netscape was receiving data. (Network I/O error)
 Try connecting again.
 
 
 If I issue a stop and a start:
 
 [root@online apache]# ./bin/apachectl stop
 ./bin/apachectl stop: httpd stopped
 [root@online apache]# ./bin/apachectl start
 ./bin/apachectl start: httpd started
 
 the server will not come back up. I have to delete the apache directory and do a "make install" again.

This appears to be a SSL problem; you need to contact the appropriate

If you can reproduce the same problem without any SSL patches
