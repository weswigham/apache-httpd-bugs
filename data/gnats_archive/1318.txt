Red Hat linux 4.2 + 2.0.30 kernel
>Description:
when using su-exec in inetd mode it prints a message about apache using
su-exec wrapper in front of every document.  I traced the problem to
http_main.c line 1472.  Apache should check if it is running in inetd mode before
printing to stderr.  I commented that line out and everything works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use su-exec and inetd mode
