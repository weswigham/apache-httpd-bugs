NCR 3600 running system V release 4.
>Description:
The hostinfo command (or file?) used by GuessOS was not found on the system.
Edited the Configure script and added a rule for the sysv4 case to match
the value returned by GuessOS. Had to edit Configuration and set WANTHSREGEX=yes
in order to compile. The "sysadm" tool used for maintaince of the system
will not let you create the user nobody with a uid of -1. Currently running
fine, http://farm.pmsc.com.
