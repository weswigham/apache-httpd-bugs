Windows_NT MDING 4 00 586
NT 4.0 Sp6a with 4.3 gig free
>Description:
I have about 4.3gig free on my drive C.
Running apace_1_3_12.exe gives error:
There is not enough space on drive C:\ to extract this package.
Please free up to 3.42 MB and click Retry.

Clicking on Retry gives the same error.  The only option is to click Cancel.
>How-To-Repeat:
Find a HDD with lots of free space on it.
>Fix:
Use winzip to extract the file manually, then run setup.exe from there.
