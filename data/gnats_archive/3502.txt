>Description:
In order to prevent <!--#perl sub=""--> when IncludesNOEXEC is set, handle_perl()
checks "!(ap_allow_options(r) && OPT_INCLUDES)", which is always set if
handle_perl is called.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set IncludesNOEXEC and <!--#perl sub="sub { print $$; }"--> - it mysteriously works fine.
>Fix:
Change the expression to:  (ap_allow_options(r) && OPT_INCNOEXEC)
