but this is not relevent...
>Description:
/path/to/a    may require authentication (config generated from DB) so "AuthType" may or may not be defined in <Directory /path/to/a>.

/path/to/a/b  never requires authentication

In order to accomodate this, I added "satisfy any" and 'allow from all' in the <Directory /path/to/a/b> section.

If "AuthType" etc. is defined in <Directory /path/to/a> everything works as expected.

If "AuthType" is NOT defined, then access to /path/to/a is granted (this is OK), but access to /path/to/a/b results in an Internal Server Error.


"Satisfy All" does not suffer from the same problem: if no authentication is defined, only the access restriction (allow/deny) are checked and access is granted based on that.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following configuration should trigger the bug.

<Directory /path/to/a>
#   AuthType                Basic
#   AuthUserFile            /usr/local/etc/apache/passwd
#   AuthName                "login test"
#   require                 valid-user

    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory /path/to/a/b>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    Satisfy any
</Directory>

DocumentRoot /path/to/a
