>Description:
I have a pbm on acces restriction on a directory of my web server.
So I have two different style of connection that i want to authorize on my server.
Just two different IP adresses have the autorization with different restriction.
.bar.com can access the directory without password, 
somebody.foo.com can access the directory WITH a password authentification
The others have no access.... 
Is it posible to do so?
I tried to use Satisfy but it's not exactly what I want ... 
satisfy any will do : if restriction1 ok OR restriction2 ok OR restriction3 ok
but I would like something like if restriction1 ok OR (restriction2 ok AND restriction3)
