Apache 1.3.6 Latest Version.Did compile with Jserv.
>Description:
Hi,

I have set up a basic authenticating system with  mod-auth,htpasswd.
.htaccess as the file for authenticating.

When I try to access any URL which is protected,I have to give User/Password
information twice.!! I have no clue whats going on. I have setup everything
properly , it doesnt show any problems. Even servlets are working ok. I have 
looked up in docs,posted on newsgroup twice--no reply!! nobody know why i think.


Please check into it as its really frustating for users to type everything
twice!!

Thanks,
Dhiraj Soni.
Web Administrator for  Odyssey.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can try to access this URL to see problem.
http://www.odysseyit.com/htdocs
give test/test as user/password.

To again see it you have to exit browser completely and
relogin.
>Fix:
I cant think of anything to solve it.

State-Changed-Why:
Fix your ServerName directive to be the same hostname that
people use to access your server or set "UseCanonicalName off".

This is not a problem with Apache.
