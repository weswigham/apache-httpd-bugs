IRIX 6.2, gcc
>Description:

The SERVER_NAME environment variable isn't being fully expanded to the complete
host.domain name format.  I.e. if I connect to http://ftp/cgi-bin/ident.cgi the 
SERVER_NAME variable gets set to only "ftp", when it should be resolved to 
"ftp.cs.umn.edu"

This problem doesn't occur on our IRIX 5.3 apache server.
>How-To-Repeat:
To demonstrate this problem, DNS needs to be configured locally such that
ftp and ftp.cs resolve to ftp.cs.umn.edu.  For example, our client /etc/resolv.conf
looks like this:
domain cs.umn.edu
nameserver 128.101.248.7
nameserver 128.101.248.58
nameserver 128.101.101.101
search cs.umn.edu umn.edu

>Fix:
Explicitly do a DNS resolution, and set SERVER_NAME to it?  (Should  be quick
as long as /etc/hosts has entries too.%2
