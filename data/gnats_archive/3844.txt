>Environment:
AIX homemart 3 4 00FFFFFF4C00
AIX 4.3.1
Compiler: CSet 3.6.4 using xlC
>Description:
Apache fails to start if there are any <Directory> or <Location> tags in any
config file, including the default httpd.conf
error message:
Expected </Directory> but saw </Directory>
or
Expected </Location> but saw </Location>

The pointer compare in the function in the http_core.c: end_nested_section
always fails.

Compiler:
CSet 3.6.4 using xlC with no addition options but what configuration script used
>How-To-Repeat:
It occurs at startup
>Fix:
Yes, I made a change to:

http_core.c:
function: static const char *end_nested_section(cmd_parms *cmd, void *dummy)
change: 
     > if (cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token) {
     < if( strcmp(cmd->cmd->name, cmd->end_token) != 0) {
this fixed the problem.
I sure you can a more effiecient way ;-)
