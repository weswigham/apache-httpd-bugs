>Description:
AdaptiveClassLoader does not support JAR URL:s. This is clearly wrong, since default 
system classloader does and java.net.URL does. While opening a stream to a JAR resource 
may suffice most of the time, sometimes you need to be able to get the actual 
URL to it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to get any resource URL with AdaptiveClassLoader. This isn't really a bug, but a lack of feature.
Please fix it.
>Fix:
Rip code from java.lang.ClassLoader! :-)
