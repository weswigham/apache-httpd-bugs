>Description:
The old NCSA server supported dbm files for access with
AuthUserfile   /somedir/somefile dbm

Did that ever get into Apache? We have a lot of .htaccess 
files and multiple webservers, so we can't just switch to
AuthDBuserfile or AuthDBMUserfile as that will break the 
NCSA servers. We have 15,000 users in the database, so a
flat file search is not on either. 

No mention of this is made in the compatibility pages, as 
far as I can find. It is in the O'Reiley book. I thought 
I saw it say somewhere else that it might be fixed at some 
stage.

Yours John.

A fix would help us swap over to Apache 1.3. However if not possible, it
can't be helped.

State-Changed-Why:

If you use mod_auth_dbm or mod_auth_db together with
mod_auth you should be able to use the
NCSA-style AuthUserFile syntax.
This is undocumented, but should work. :-)
