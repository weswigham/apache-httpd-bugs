State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Thu Jun 15 11:33:34 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Do not install Win98 binaries on Win95... instead download
the Winsock2 update from Microsoft, and you now need to
tell it to overwrite newer files.

Also be sure you have edited your httpd.conf file to set
the ServerName properly.
