>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 98
Apache binary executable
>Description:
I use the apache server to learn more about cgi and php scripting.
When i start the server offline it works perfect.
When i'm online (winsock.dll is active) i get this error code and a dos console opens
opens every second.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I use t-online software (Germany) to log in.
Perhaps i use a wrong winsock.dll, on the MS Page there is only a binary
executable to download but i want to install winsock.dll manually.
I have to be sure that it depends on winsock.

State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 14 22:41:15 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Please try using the latest release 1.3.12...
Do -not- try using the Win95 Winsock2 release, Win98 is
distributed with it's own Winsock2.
Assure you have changed the ServerName in your httpd.conf
file, and that your IP addresses and port assignments are
all correct.
