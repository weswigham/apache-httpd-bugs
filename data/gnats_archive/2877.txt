>Environment:
I am using a Sun Enterprise with Solaris 5.1.
uname -a command: SunOS jacui 5.5.1 Generic_103640-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
Compiler: gcc
>Description:
I compiled apache with the following modules:
                --enable-module=auth_dbm --enable-shared=auth_dbm \
                --enable-module=cern_meta --enable-shared=cern_meta \
                --enable-module=digest --enable-shared=digest \
                --enable-module=log_agent --enable-shared=log_agent \
		...

It compiled OK. But when I go to run the first time whith "apachectl start",
the following error happen:

jacui# apachectl start
Syntax error on line 26 of /home1/httpd/etc/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /home1/httpd/libexec/mod_log_agent.so into server: ld.so.1: /home1/httpd/sbin/httpd: 
fatal: relocation error: symbol not found: ap_palloc: referenced in /home1/httpd/libexec/mod_log_agent.so
apachectl start: httpd could not be started


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
It works well when I comment the "LoadModule" lines in the httpd.conf archieve.

State-Changed-Why:
I cannot reproduce this under Solaris 2.6 with GCC 2.7.2.
Can it be that your GCC version doesn't match exactly
your Solaris version (compare uname with gcc -v)?
