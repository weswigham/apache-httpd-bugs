>Environment:
- HP-UX B.10.10
- HP 9000/755
- standard cc compiler
>Description:
Had to add the following flags to the cc options in Configuration
file (when compiling source files):

-O  (The default "-O2" was an invalid option for level 2 optimization)
-Ae (for extended ANSI mode)

This may save others time and research.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
When config.guess determines HPUX10 OS type, add the above flags to
the cc options
