 With the new 'IfDefine' directive, it would be great if we could allow in
 the .htaccess file items like:
  
 SetEnvIf HTTP_USER_AGENT "^Mozilla/[0-3]" Netscape
 <IfDefine !Netscape>
  # Set non-netscape stuff here.
 </IfDefine>
  
 Yet another advantage to allow SetEnvIf in .htaccess.  This also calls for
 a change in IfDefine. Currently, IfDefine's parameter-name argument is a
 define as given on the httpd command line via -Dparameter-, at the time
 the server was started. Would be better to allow it to also use the
 attributes from SetEnv.

 This would allow stuff in .htaccess like: 
 
  SetEnvIf HTTP_USER_AGENT "^Mozilla/[0-3]" Netscape
  <IfDefine Netscape>
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteRule ^.*/~mydir/Errors/BrowserCompatability.html [L]
  </IfDefine>
 
  SetEnvIf HTTP_USER_AGENT "MSIE" MSIE
  <IfDefine MSIE>
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteRule ^.*/~mydir/Errors/BrowserCompatability.html [L]
  </IfDefine>
   
 Sorry about that, sent that last email too fast. =(

 Since IfDefine uses as its parameter-name given on the httpd cmmand
 line, maybe a new directive called IfEnvar should be used when the
 attribute is gotten from SetEnvIf.  Of course the module for IfDefine and
 IfEnvar would have to be evaluated relatively early as it could be used to
 effect the output of modules like authentication and rewrite.
 
 I'm trying to redirect a user to a different URL if a non-netscape browser
 is found. If a netscape browser is found then I want to authenticate. This
 example could be acheived by IfEnvar and SetEnvIf, however I think there
 are many other useful applications for the above mentioned suggestion.

 You should be able to do this with BrowserMatch/SetEnfIf and
 mod_rewrite.  mod_rewrite allows you to make decisions based upon
 environment variables.

 Ken --
 What you CAN currently do now (and what I am doing) is something like
 this:
 --- .htaccess file contents ---------------------------------------------------
 satisfy all
 allow from all
 AuthType Basic
 AuthNameClass Transcripts
 AuthExternal kerbcheck
 require user ..... # list all valid users
 
 RewriteEngine on
 RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} MSIE             [OR]
 RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !^Mozilla/[4-9]\.
 RewriteRule ^.* /~myid/Errors/BrowserCompatability.html [L]
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The problem with this is, since the authentication modules are carried out
 before the rewrite modules, one needs to authenticate first! If the user
 successfuly authenticates and is using a non-compatible browser an error
 message appears (waiste of an authentication).
 
 What I proposed, would stop this problem. It would allow something like:
 --- Proposed .htaccess file contents ------------------------------------------
 SetEnvIf HTTP_USER_AGENT "^Mozilla/[0-3]" Netscape
 <IfDefine Netscape>
  satisfy all
  allow from all
  AuthType Basic
  AuthNameClass Transcripts
  AuthExternal kerbcheck
  require user ..... # list all valid users
 </IfDefine>
 
 <IfDefine !Netscape>
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} MSIE             [OR]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !^Mozilla/[4-9]\.
  RewriteRule ^.* /~myid/Errors/BrowserCompatability.html [L]
 </IfDefine>
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 As you can see, if the netscape browser is noted, then the user is asked
 to authenticate, and if it is a non-netscape browswer, the user doesn't
 authenticate andjust receives an error message!
 
 This would be of great use to me and I'm sure would add the flexability
 that would allow others to make use of it to. My request calls for,
 SetEnvIf to be used in the htaccess file and allow IfDefine to accept the
 paramter-name from SetEnvIf.

  RJW
 
 PS - Sorry I haven't replied to this in like 2 months, but I usually get
 emailed when the PR is replied to and that wasn't the case this time. :(.
 Anyway, I hope this _great_ feature can be implemented. The lower of the
 SetEnvIf shouldn't be hard (as the code is already written), and IfDefine
 or whatever it is to be called in this case should be hard to modify.
 THANKS FOR THE LOOK and the implementation :-)

 BTW Ken, I can't do this with BrowserMatch/SetEnvIf and mod_rewrite; 
 Apache currently doesn't allow BrowserMatch/SetEnvIf in the htaccess file
 (so I can't access them as a USER). The use of those in the htaccess file
 isn't all that is needed. IfDefine would also be needed or the
 authentication would occur (why authenticate just to get a browser
 incompatible message). For a correct working setup, see the propsed
 htaccess file in my last post/email on PR #3000. Hopefully this can be
 added into Apache.
