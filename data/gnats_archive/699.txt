Some more info regarding the problem report I sent earlier today.

I made the following two modifications to the proxy modules to get some
more log information:

*** mod_proxy.c Mon Jun  9 13:47:00 1997
--- mod_proxy.c.orig    Mon Jun  9 13:38:59 1997
***************
*** 143,150 ****
            {
                r->filename = pstrcat(r->pool, "proxy:", ent[i].real,
                                      r->uri + len, NULL);
-               log_printf(r->server, "proxy alias %s -> %s",
-                          r->uri, r->filename);
                r->handler = "proxy-server";
                return OK;
            }
--- 143,148 ----


*** proxy_http.c        Mon Jun  9 14:05:11 1997
--- proxy_http.c.orig   Mon Jun  9 14:01:48 1997
***************
*** 247,254 ****
      f = bcreate(pool, B_RDWR);
      bpushfd(f, sock, sock);
  
-     log_printf(r->server, "proxy request %s",url);
- 
      hard_timeout ("proxy send", r);
      bvputs(f, r->method, " ", url, " HTTP/1.0\015\012", NULL);
      bvputs(f, "Host: ", desthost, NULL);
--- 247,252 ----

Using the directive:

ProxyPass /internal/ss1 http://ss1.bath.ac.uk

and requesting "/internal/ss1/" produces the following log messages:

["date"] proxy alias /internal/ss1/ -> proxy:http://ss1.bath.ac.uk/
["date"] proxy request /internal/ss1/

 Mark Hindess.

Adding the originator and release version, missing due to
how this got into the bugdb.

     [Additional information from the originator]
 
 By the way, the following patch fixes both "bugs" for _ME_:
 
 *** proxy_http.c        Wed Jun 11 10:37:33 1997
 --- proxy_http.c.orig   Mon Jun  9 14:01:48 1997
 ***************
 *** 207,213 ****
   
       if (proxyhost != NULL)
       {
 !       url = r->filename + 6;                  /* restore original URL */
         server.sin_port = htons(proxyport);
         err = proxy_host2addr(proxyhost, &server_hp);
         if (err != NULL) return DECLINED;  /* try another */
 --- 207,213 ----
   
       if (proxyhost != NULL)
       {
 !       url = r->uri;                   /* restore original URL */
         server.sin_port = htons(proxyport);
         err = proxy_host2addr(proxyhost, &server_hp);
         if (err != NULL) return DECLINED;  /* try another */
 
 Clearly, this only fixes things when you are chaining to another proxy
 with ProxyRemote, since without ProxyRemote proxyhost always equals
 NULL. I believe the problem with losing the query string only occurred
 when ProxyRemote was used. However, the problem with ProxyPass semantics
 occurs with or without the ProxyRemote statement.
 
 This leads me to the conclusion that my solution is probably _not_ the
 correct solution!
 
 Hope that makes some sense,
  Cheers,
   Mark.
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Mon Aug 18 02:39:34 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:

A patch has been committed to 1.2.3 and 1.3a2-dev.

>Unformatted:


I notice that the above problem has been closed because the originator
of the report did not response to your question. However, the problem
described in the report still exists in Apache 1.2.0.

I have two servers www and ss1. www has a line in srm.conf:

ProxyPass /internal/ss1 http://ss1.bath.ac.uk/

If www receives a request for "/internal/ss1/", then the logs on ss1
also show a request for "/internal/ss1/" _not_ a request for "/".

If you require further details, I will happily supply them.

Cheers,
 Mark Hindess.
