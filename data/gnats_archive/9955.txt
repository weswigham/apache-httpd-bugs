Notice the .a vs the .la for libexpat....
This most certainly isn't right though.

Comment-Added:
Do you have a /usr/local/lib/libexpat.la file?
Or, was your expat somehow built without libtool?

As we understand it, Expat should always be built
with libtool, so not having the libexpat.la seems
like something is corrupted or an installation
is incomplete.
