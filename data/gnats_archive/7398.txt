Follows the output during make, and then what I tried to do about it.

Oh, configure command was --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 --enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max --with-mpm=mpmt_pthread --with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl

First:
In file included from http_core.c:72:
/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/include/scoreboard.h:73: mpm_default.h: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [http_core.lo] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/modules/http'
make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/modules/http'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/modules'
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

So I hand edited scoreboard.h to have the full path to 
httpd-2_0_14/server/mpm/threaded/mpm_default.h" instead of bare "default.h"

This change got me over the above hump until I hit:
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/os'
Making all in server
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/server'
Making all in mpm
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/server/mpm'
Making all in mpmt_pthread
/bin/sh: cd: mpmt_pthread: No such file or directory

which really looked weird to me, as there isn't anything remotely like
an mpmt_pthread directory lying around.

grep mpmt_pthread */* in the mpm directory got zilch, so I don't know where
to go from here
>How-To-Repeat:
In the attempt to do so myself, I got:

make[2]: Entering directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/server/mpm'
Making distclean in mpmt_pthread
/bin/sh: cd: mpmt_pthread: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** [distclean-recursive] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/server/mpm'
make[1]: *** [distclean-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/vanveen/dinbox/httpd-2_0_14/server'
make: *** [distclean-recursive] Error 1

while trying to clean up for another go at it.

Starting from scratch again simply got the same results. Small wonder.

>Fix:
I suspect this is an oversight in the configure scripts, but I don't quite have the 
expertise to track it down further, given the errors I got. Hopefully this helps
someone.
>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 13 13:26:28 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Your configure option --with-mpm=mpmt_pthread was invalid.

That MPM has been renamed to "threaded" so use 
"--with-mpm=threaded".

Thanks for your report and for using Apache.
