>Description:
In some cases it's desirable to split the compilation and installation of
mod_jserv the Apache module, and ApacheJServ.jar the Java servlet engine.
This could be where Apache was running on one machine, and the servlet engine
was running on another different machine.

There does not seem to be a way to do this. An attempt to ./configure the
package on a machine without JDK fails, even if there is no desire to run
the servlet engine on that machine.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Include the option to install either mod_jserv, or ApacheJServ.jar, or default
to both. Perhaps:

./configure --module-only
./configure --servlet-only

Or something along these lines. The --module-only option will not require JDK,
and the --servlet-only option will not require gcc.
