>Description:
If a server actis like a proxy but inserts a Cookie it will not send
the cookie back to the client. This is caulsed by the fact that not all
r->headers_out are checked before the request is send back to the client.

>How-To-Repeat:
configure a rewrite rule:
RewriteRule ^bla/(.*) https://bla.gnarst.net/bal/$1 [P]
and have the proxy (the server which hold the configuration above this line)
insert a cookie. It will not be send back to the client.
