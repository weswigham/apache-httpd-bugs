>Description:
This happens either with PHP 3.0.12 or 4B3. When I run 'apachectl start' it won't start. If I remove any reference to PHP from the configuration files, issue the start command, put the php module back and issue 'apachectl graceful' it will run nicely indefinitevily.
I have strace logs of apache an their children. The main process doesn't segfault, but the children that seems to be loading PHP aborts.
I can provide them by uploading to a site, or by mail. Contact me for more information.
