SunOS 5.7 Generic sun4m sparc
java version "1.2", Solaris VM (build Solaris_JDK_1.2_01, native threads, sunwjit)

>Description:
At first try, the servlet_error_log file is filled with :
[17/03/1999 17:07:36 CET]: JServ Startup complete.  Listening for connections  on port 8007
java.lang.VerifyError: org/apache/jserv/JServConnection.run()V at pc 811: stack height conflict: 0 vs. 1

        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:485)

It seems to be a security problem, but what can I do with that ?
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install all that and try a simple servlet
>Fix:
No ... have a final version of jserv0.9.12 adn jserv1.0 compliant 
jdk1.2 for solaris ?

 Problem solved.
 It was just a little problem of compatibility of java code.
 To fix :
 Extract source of jserv from jserv0.9.12.jar, remove all classes,
 recompile with this version of javac (Solaris VM, build Solaris_JDK_1.2_01, native threads, sunwjit)
 recreate the jar archive.
 
 And it works fine !
 
 Thank you again for your program, which is really usefull to me !
 
 If you want you could add this platform to the supported list :
 - Jserv 0.9.12
 - Solaris 7
 - Java 1.2 (Solaris VM, build Solaris_JDK_1.2_01, native threads, sunwjit)
