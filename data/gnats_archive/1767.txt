>Description:
I have configured my FreeBSD to host several domains. Since I did a restart
(to take out the sound card of the machine) only the first Virtual Host
shows up in the webbrowser for all the domains hosted on this machine.

When I change the order in the conf files the site that shows up first 
is the one that gets shown, the others 'link' to the contents of this
host

 Have you read the vhost documentation at
 http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/ ?
 
 If you upgraded from 1.2 to 1.3 then things have changed you need to read
 that documentation.

 Hi,
 
 I've read the docs and yes it works fine now. The only thing that is
 strange that it worked well before I rebooted the machine. Anyway Thanx !!
 
 Kind regards,
