>Description:
Inside http_main.c we have the following function declaration:
---------------------------------
static void usage(char *bin)
{
    char pad[MAX_STRING_LEN];
    unsigned i;
 
    for (i = 0; i < strlen(bin); i++)
    pad[i] = ' ';                             //<<<------Buffer overflow
    pad[i] = '\0';
-------------------------

Call to this function is made from a lot of places like this:

---------------------
 case 'h':
     usage(argv[0]);
 case '?':
     usage(argv[0]);
---------------------
MAX_STRING_LEN has a size of 8k.
Although argv[0] will be less that 1k on most shells, but if somebody writes a custom shell or if somebody calles apache through exec() with an argv[0] size of greater than 8k then apache will crash.
This problem isn't really a big security threat but still its a bug which needs to be fixed :)
>How-To-Repeat:
If somebody writes a custom shell or if somebody calls apache through exec() with an argv[0] size of greater than 8k then apache will crash.
>Fix:
it can be fixed doing the following in ur usage()
  if(strlen(bin)>=MAX_STRING_LEN) 
     bin += strlen(bin)-(MAX_STRING_LEN+1); // bin is now a string containing the last 8k characters of the original bin.
