Not relevant, but all flavours of Linux, apache 1.3.x
>Description:
I have a website which is under constant attack, it is a bit half hearted at the 
moment (probably because they don't on what it is based) but I want to see clearly
what they a) sent and b) their IP address _IN_EVERY_CASE_. This doesn't happen.

It makes it very difficult to trace who is doing exactly what.

EVERY line in error_log should have a date/time, preferably in exactly the same
format as the access_log and _MUST_ have an IP address and preferably the possibility
of a REFERER URL.

BTW please you put a WRAP=Soft into the <textarea> tags in this bug report form
>How-To-Repeat:
I would prefer not. But try any invalid thing.
>Fix:
Modify the logging module so that you can specify information you always want on the front
of every error_log line?
