>Description:
When trying to debug an Apache problem with Electric Fence, EF reported
an out-of-bounds access.  This turned out to stem from this code in mod_jserv.c:

        /* Try to find if we have a protocol://host */
        for (x=0; (x<128) & (buf[x]!='\0'); x++) {
            if ((buf[x]==':') & (buf[x+1]=='/') & (buf[x+2]=='/')) {
            ^^^^ previous line is caught by ElectricFence
                if (x!=0) {
                    protocol=buf;
                    buf[x]='\0';
                }

The bug is a typo, or confusion on the part of the person who wrote the code;
the bitwise operator & was used instead of the logical operator &&.
& isn't short-circuited and && is, so the above line always accesses
all of  buf[x], buf[x+1], buf[x+2].
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache with Electric Fence, and edit main/alloc.c to use malloc()
and free().
>Fix:
A patch that fixes the place where EF segfaults is at
   ftp://starship.python.net/pub/crew/amk/new/jserv-patch

This patch does NOT fix all the typos.  Do a search for '{space}&{space}'
and '{space}|{space}', and you'll find other places where bitwise operators
have been used where logical ones make more sense.  

A grep through the other C files didn't turn up any problems, so mod_jserv.c
may be the only affected file.
