Alias directive, which worked under 1.3b3, no longer works.

From srm.conf:
Alias /its2/    //misntwks/inetpub2/
Alias /its3/    "//misntwks/inetpub2/"
Alias /its4/    "g:/inetpub2/wwwroot2/"

produces in error_log:
[Thu Apr 23 15:43:34 1998] [crit] (22)Invalid argument: \\/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

      More information:
      
      The problem is not the result of switching from b3 to b6 as I had 
      thought. It occurs in both versions when you switch from running 
      Apache as an application to running Apache as a service.
      
      And the problem, if I wasn't clear before, is that I get a permission
      denied error when trying to access files -- through an alias -- on a 
      drive that is being shared by another NT machine.
      
      The situation is this:
      
      If I start Apache b3 or b6 
      as an application, I can alias
      /its2/ to "g:/inetpub2/wwwroot2/".
      
      But if I start b3 or b6 as a 
      service. I get the Permission
      denied error when trying to
      access its2.
