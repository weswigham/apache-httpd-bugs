State-Changed-Why:
"cleaning up after itself"?  Erm... I don't know what you
mean.

That is perfectly proper behaviour when you have it configured
in a manner that doesn't work on your system... you simply have
to fix the config.

#-1 is the most portable group to use, even though it doesn't
work on all system.s
