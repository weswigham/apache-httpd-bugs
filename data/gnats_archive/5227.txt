>Description:
When compiling Apache with shared core and DSO support the module order affects
the way Apache behaves. When installing PHP (3.0.12 in this case) with support
for the Solid RDBMS, inserting the PHP module _before_ mod_cgi in the module
list creates no problems. Inserting the PHP module _after_ mod_cgi results in
Apache not starting at all (but no core dumps). This problem exists _only_ when
PHP is compiled with Solid RDBMS support (versions 2.3 and 3.0 tested), thus
making it a problem that may or may not be with Apache - it also might have
something to do with PHP. I am submitting this report to the PHP development
team as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache (1.3.9) with --enable-module=all --enable-shared=max
--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE --enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN; Compile PHP (3.0.12)
with --with-apxs=<path to apxs> --with-solid=<path to solid includes/libs>;
the PHP module gets installed as the last one in the module list by default -
Apache will not start. Move mod_php above mod_cgi in the module list and
Apache starts nicely.
