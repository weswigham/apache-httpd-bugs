find_title() in 1.2.6 uses strcasecmp but in 1.3b6 still uses strcmp
for examining the content_type.

Decide whether MIME types are case-sensitive....
There were some other strcasecmp changes in 1.2.6; I haven't checked
whether they all made it into 1.3b6.

 Er, what I mean... open reading a mime-type from the user it's mapped to
 lower case.  But yeah this is probably still a bug.  I need to wake up
