Apache 1.3.1 dies unexpectedly with the following error:

This brings down the entire httpd.  There are no other error messages, console
output, or core dumps.

My apache is configured very minimally: it does not include cgi, actions, include, or any non-standard module except for mod_perl 1.15.

 Does this happen all the time?  Just once in a while?  How long does it
 take for it to happen?
 
 Are you using NFS at all?  
 
 Can you try without modperl?
 
 Please also try compiling it not using egcs.

 Hi Lars,
 
 Sorry it took me a few days to fool with this.  To answer the original
 questions: I am not using any NFS, nor mandatory kernel file locking.  I
 have experienced this problem with gcc, egcs/glibc1, and pgcc/glibc[12],
 all on Linux 2.0.34.  I am also finding this problem with Apache 1.3.1
 and 1.3.0, with mod_perl verisions 1.12, 1.14, and 1.15
 
 I tried to reproduce the problem using CGI instead of mod_perl, and I
 could not.  When the server dies under mod_perl, it is answering over
 100 requests per second.  Under CGI, I simply cannot reproduce that
 connection rate, and it loafs along at ~4 requests per second.  This may
 indicate that it is a mod_perl problem.
 
 The problem also seems to crop up when I issue 'apachectl stop'. 
 Witness this entry in my error_log, when I started the httpd, then
 stopped it b/c I stuffed up my code.  The only intervening step was a
 mod_perl program which returned 500.

 I was hoping to attach gdb to this sucker, but I haven't been able to
 get Apache to do this lately, despite my attempts to make its life
 difficult.  If I come up with anything I'll get it to you.
 
 Thanks,

[Note from another person]
Hoping this gets added to PR 2723.

My system is experiencing the same problem.  The lock file is *not*
on an NFS-mounted volume.

  * System is a 4-CPU P6-200 running SMP-aware Linux 2.0.30. 
  * Apache 1.3.1
  * Compiled with gcc 2.7.2.1
  * mod_perl 1.15 and mod_ssl (2.06) have been incorporated.
  * The optional rewrite, status, and info modules have been enabled.

I wrote a health monitor to help me pinpoint the spot in the error
log that is closest to the error by tacking some extra entries in
the error_log immediately when it notices that the parent has died
(note the '###' lines below).  The health monitor checks when the
process referenced in httpd.pid disappears, and finally restarts the
server when a connection to port 80 is refused.

For whatever reason, connections would *continue* to be accepted even
though the root process died for a short period (presumably until
children exhaust their request limit), but I haven't investigated
that aspect of the problem.  However, that masked the time that the
parent was exiting since loads of the accept() failures would show
up afterwards until connections were refused.

It appears that the parent is exiting when a child gets a
LOCK_EX failure on the accept lockfile.  The child exits
with APEXIT_CHILDFATAL, which triggers the parent to die
(main/http_main.c:3970).  Since there's a host of things that can
cause children to die (especially with mod_perl thrown in the mix),
this seems like inappropriate behavior.

I'll try to dig in a bit more tomorrow to see if I can figure out
what's up with the accept() problem.  "Bad file number" ain't tellin'
me much.  I haven't figured out what conditions cause it to show
up--it exits pretty randomly through the day.  Our entire site is
delivered via mod_perl content, so I doubt I can test without that.

Jeffrey- If you haven't hacked something up already, I'll send you
         my health monitor/keeper-aliver script.  That'll keep you
         going until the bug's been fixed.

 Lars et al,
 
 It was a mere 17 days ago when Lincoln Stein contacted me to reveal that
 he has the same problem with the very latest and greatest versions of
 Apache and mod_perl (1.3.3/1.16, respectively).  I have included our email
 exchange to add to this bug report.

 Hi Jeffrey,
 
 I see from the Apache bug database that you're seeing this problem:
 
 [emerg] (9)Bad file number: flock: LOCK_EX: Error getting accept lock.
 Exiting!
 [emerg] (9)Bad file number: flock: LOCK_EX: Error getting accept lock.
 Exiting!
 
 All of a sudden (as of last week) I'm seeing it too!  Every so often
 it brings down the root web server...arrgh!
 
 Did you ever find a solution or workaround for this?  I'm running
 Linux 2.0.33, with Apache/1.3.3 mod_perl/1.16.

 Lincoln,
 
 I haven't had this problem in a while, I was hoping it had quietly gone
 away. 
 My success could be due to an upgrade to libc6, but I am not sure.  I have
 received several emails from people with the same problem.
 
 I am interested in this bit from the CHANGES file:
 
 *) PORT: Apache has need for mutexes to serialize its children around
    accept.  In prior versions either fcntl file locking or flock file
    locking were used.  The method is chosen by the definition of
    USE_xxx_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT in conf.h.  xxx is FCNTL for fcntl(),
    and FLOCK for flock().  New options have been added:
       - SYSVSEM to use System V style semaphores
       - PTHREAD to use POSIX threads (appears to work on Solaris only)
       - USLOCK to use IRIX uslock
    Based on timing various techniques, the following changes were made
    to the defaults:
       - Linux 2.x uses flock instead of fcntl
       - Solaris 2.x uses pthreads
       - IRIX uses SysV semaphores -- however multiprocessor IRIX boxes
           work far faster if you -DUSE_USLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 
 Since flock() is failing, perhaps it would be useful to modify conf.h to
 use
 fcntl() instead, or even pthread if your linuxpthread library is recent.
 
 Good Luck,
 Jeffrey

 pthread didn't work -- some constants aren't defined in pthread.h.
 I'll try the fcntl... or maybe upgrade to glibc, which is something I
 have to do anyway.
 
 Lincoln

 You can see that the problem has not gone away.

 According To Brad Cox <bcox@vs2.gmu.edu>, recompiling Apache to use
 ioctl corrects this bug on linux.  Performance implications of this have
 not been quantified.

 I just measured it. It serves requests more than 1,000,000 times faster
 running with ioctl than crashed with flock. See for yourself.
