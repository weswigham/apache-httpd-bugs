>Description:
In the section of the file SRM.CONF where you can set the "User" directory, 
there's a typing error in the default file produced by the Installation 
Program. Here's what the default output is:

#UserDir "/c:/developer/Apache/users/"

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The first forward slash "/" shouldn't be there and you need to edit the
Installation Program to avoid putting in an extra forward slash there.
