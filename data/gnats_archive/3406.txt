>Environment:
The Internet: your main site and at least one of your mirror sites.
>Description:
I couldn't download Apache 1.3.3 for Win32 from your main server or Italian mirror.
GetRight acts like the file doesn't exist.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.apache.org/dist/apache_1_3_3.exe
http://mathema.it/pub/apache/dist/apache_1_3_3.exe
>Fix:
If you removed the file/the file disapperaed for any reason, just put it back ;^)

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Nov 17 08:53:28 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The file is there just fine.  GetRight is banned from
the Apache web site, however, because it is a program that
is poorly written and has options that are far too easily
set (without warning) to do bad things.
