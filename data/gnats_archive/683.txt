>Environment:
QNX 4.23A
Watcom C 10.6
>Description:
QNX starting from v4.20 does support mmap() system call, just imposing some restrictions to an underlying file descriptor.

This descriptor must be obtained by POSIX shn_open() call, then ltrunc() must be applied to set size of shared object. The object must be unlinked upon exit.

That object can't be read/write/resized and must reside under /dev/shmem. Allowed operations with such fd are: open, close, stat, unlink.

The mmap() itself works nice and above limitations are irrelevant to Apache as of v1.2, so I think it would be nice to add support, just for better performance.
>How-To-Repeat:
Nope.
>Fix:
Yes - I have modified version of http_main.c and conf.h.
Changes are pretty minimal, few lines of code, surrounded by #ifdef QNX.

I tested it and it works nice.

I have "diff -n" output for Apache 1.2b11 and can do it for 1.2 as well

 Hi Igor,
 
 Is there any chance you could implement the changes you describe for mmap
 under qnx and send a patch?  The only file that needs tweaking is
 http_main.c (well, and conf.h to add #define HAVE_QNX_MMAP or something like
 that).
 
 Thanks
 Dean
