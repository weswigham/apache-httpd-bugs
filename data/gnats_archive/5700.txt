>Description:
.htaccess
  AddHandler xmlparser .xml
  Action xmlparser /xmlparser.php

If you then request a non-existent .xml file (e.g http://www.anywhere.org/not-here.xml)
Apache doesn't produce a 404 error, it just passes the .xml file URL to the script.
This is only broken in 1.3.11, 404 errors are produced in 1.3.9.

(I thought I had already submitted this bug, but never got any E-Mail about it and
it doesn't appear in the bug database, so this is one last attempt)
>How-To-Repeat:
Have no example URL's as I have already patched our servers.  But follow the
.htaccess instructions above and give it a try.
