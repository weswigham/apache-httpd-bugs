uname=>SunOS einstein.base2inc.com 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

gcc 2.8.1
java 1.1.7
apache-jserv 1.0b2 (static)

mod_jserv.c source copied into apache source tree in src/modules/jserv
and compiled in this manner:

./configure --with-layout=GNU --activate-module=src/modules/jserv/mod_jserv.o
make
then httpd copied into /usr/local/apache/sbin

also configured with --enable-module=rewrite

exhibited same systems both ways
also exhibits the same symptons with apache version 1.3.1
>Description:
No matter what I do, the authentication is somehow bypassed on the
servlets directory only. Everything works fine on any htdocs directory
as well as the cgi-bin directory.

Servlets are located in /usr/local/apache/share/servlets

access.conf contains the following:

<Directory /usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin>
Options None
AllowOverride AuthConfig
</Directory>

<Directory /usr/local/apache/share/servlets>
Options None
AllowOverride AuthConfig
</Directory>

Then the same .htaccess file is placed in both the cgi-bin as well as
the servlets directory that looks like:

AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/security/kit/users
AuthGroupFile /usr/local/apache/security/kit/groups
AuthName "Digital Workflow Toolkit"
AuthType Basic

require user fmorton


Again, this setup works fine with cgi and all htdocs directory,
but not with servlets for some reason. Accessing servlets does not
even ask for a user/password and happily runs the servlet.

The servlet used is the Hello.class file distributed with apache-jserv
that is basically a "hello world" servlet. Couldn't be any simpler.
>How-To-Repeat:
I can repeat it endlessly in the configuration above, but have not
tried in another enviroment. I suspect this is not so much a software
bug but some particular installation requirement with apache-jserv
combined with the authentication module.

I have tried all other avenues i know of to get this resolved
without success.

 As Pier Fumagalli explains:
 
 Apache and JServ does not share the same "filesystem", due to
 their three-tier implementation...So apache does not have any
 reference to jserv locations...You should try doing something
 
 <Location /servlets>
  Options None
  AllowOverride AuthConfig
  AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/security/kit/users
  AuthGroupFile /usr/local/apache/security/kit/groups
  AuthName "Digital Workflow Toolkit"
  AuthType Basic
  require user fmorton
 </Location>
 
 (If that's valid) anyway you shouldn't use .htaccess w/ servlets,
 but you should configure it via *.conf
 
 This was confirmed to work.
