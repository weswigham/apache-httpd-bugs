Some log records are out of order, showing earlier access last, e.g. (anonymized)

somehost.domain.com - - [16/Oct/1998:17:07:00 -0400] "GET /Directory/image/bg.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 569 "http://server.domain.com/Directory/page.html" "Mozilla/4.07 [en] (Win98; U)"
somehost.domain.com - - [16/Oct/1998:17:07:02 -0400] "GET /Directory/image/story.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 9554 "http://server.domain.com/Directory/page.html" "Mozilla/4.07 [en] (Win98; U)"
somehost.domain.com - - [16/Oct/1998:17:07:02 -0400] "GET /Directory/image/welcome.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 1440 "http://server.domain.com/Directory/page.html" "Mozilla/4.07 [en] (Win98; U)"
somehost.domain.com - - [16/Oct/1998:17:07:14 -0400] "GET /Directory/page.html HTTP/1.0" 200 24290 "-" "Mozilla/4.07 [en] (Win98; U)"

page.html has accessed first, yet in the logs shows up last (possibly due to persistant connection with the HTML file being the first request, and logging occurring only after that request and subsequent subrequests have terminated?)

 How do you know that page.html was accessed first?  
 
 It is quite practical that if the client is using multiple connections
 then it will start downloading the HTML in one, and start getting various
 images in others as it parses it.  In this case, the images are shorter
 than the HTML so it is very possible that they complete first.

 So the log time indicates when the request was COMPLETED rather than when the
 request was STARTED?
