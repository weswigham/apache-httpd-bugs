>Environment:
This happens for all of the Apaches 1.2.0 or later, 
tested on Linux 2.0.33, iE86, GCC 2.7.2. (Cyrix 6x86L PR166+ Linux system, 16mb
EDO RAM, 4.7GB EIDE Western Digital Harddrive).  Personally tested on 1.2.0,
rumored to work on all Apache's to 1.2.4.  No problem has been seen or attempted
to be fixed.
>Description:
If you use a program posted to bugtraq today, you can effectivley bring a box to
it's knees using the program.  This program sends repeated requests with lots of
/'s.  This isn't a real bug in Apache, but it takes a few seconds to have it think
about the problem.  If these requests are sent in a loop, the box will gradually
slow down and come to almost a stop.  Below is some system stats for my machine
about 15 seconds after I stopped the attack.

>How-To-Repeat:
View the bugtraq article and use his program.  You may download the files to
create the crash at www.gashalot.com/beck.zip , this way you can download it
yourself (it is private, since I don't think that anyone else should have this
bug.
>Fix:
Patch in something looking for more than 3 /'s in a row.  If a user is typning
3 /'s in a row, simply spit back a message telling him to take out some of the
/'s.  Never are 3 /'s in a row justified, or needed.  This way the server just 
appears to have heavy traffic when attacked

Comment-Added:
We are looking into this to verify the exact issue and
formulate the correct solution.  Your proposed solution
is not correct; under no circumstances should a Web server
make such a blanket assumption about what is intended.  If
the request complies with the relevant RFCs and is
syntactically correct, it must be permitted to pass.  What
about a server-side script that uses multiple slashes as
delimiters in either the PATH_INFO or the URL argument,
such as <http://host/script/path-info/a////b?&c=1&d=/////>?
That's a perfectly valid URL and no server has any business
complaining about it.  As you can see, determining the
right way to deal with this is not as simple as it may
appear.
