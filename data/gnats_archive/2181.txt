Greetings,

Suddenly, sites that used to work are no longer working, reporting "an error occurred in the Windows Internet extensions". (MSIE 4.01 on NT sp3; I have some power toys installed, do not know about someone else who has reported the problem.)

I notice that all these sites are now running 1.2.6:

www.macresource.com/mrp/main.shtml

State-Changed-Why:
I can't reproduce your problem with IE4 and SP3, and we
have had no other reports of it and 1.2.6 really doesn't
send anything new or special that could cause it.

I have to suggest that this problem is almost certainly in
your setup or something broken with your IE installation.
