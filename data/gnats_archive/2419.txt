>Description:
suexec is designed to only accept and process a given single command.  this is good, but
disallows useful things such as:  <!--#exec cmd="counter -font green" -->  I wrote and submitted
a patch (back in 1.3b2 I believe) to allow parameters to pass through suexec.  Currently,
I re-patch suexec with each release of Apache, but I'm sure other people out there
could use parameters via suexec as well.

Since I haven't heard anything (good or bad), I thought I'd submit it again.
