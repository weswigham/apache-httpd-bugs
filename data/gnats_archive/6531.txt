>Organization:
>Environment:
Irix 6.5
>Description:
Apache/2.0a6 doesn't disable the Nagle algorithm on listening
sockets like Apache/1.3 does.  It is still disabled on accepted sockets
(returned by accept()) but not listening sockets (passed to accept()).
Compare make_sock() in 1.3 and 2.0.

This affects performance at least on Irix, where setsockopt(TCP_NODELAY)
is not necessary on the accepted socket if the listening socket has
TCP_NODELAY set.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Restore the call to ap_sock_disable_nagle() to make_sock() ala 1.3 --
except that ap_sock_disable_nagle() is part of the MPM API (for some MPMs),
so maybe instead make every MPM do it after calling ap_listen_open() or
ap_setup_listeners().

>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: abagchi
State-Changed-When: Sat Oct  7 21:03:55 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
If DISABLE_NAGLE_INHERITED is defined when building the
server, then the listening socket will disable_nagle,
otherwise the accepted socket must disable nagle itself.
