>Description:
Enabling the Cache function of apache 1.2b10 seems to work (and work well)
for a short period of time, then after several users hit the system (via
the proxy) the error_log file grows at an alarming rate with the following
error messages

[Wed May 14 16:16:23 1997] open:
/export/home/httpd/proxy///////////////////////
////////////////////////////////ime: Too many open files
[Wed May 14 16:16:23 1997] open:
/export/home/httpd/proxy///////////////////////
////////////////////////////////ime: Too many open files
[Wed May 14 16:16:23 1997] open:
/export/home/httpd/proxy///////////////////////
////////////////////////////////ime: Too many open files

The proxy directory access is available to HTTPD and it writes a
multitude of directories and files. Definitely functioning as
cache, already tested via browsers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup with standard configuration:
Stock Standard Configuration (at least until it works)

ProxyRequests On
CacheRoot /export/home/httpd/proxy
CacheSize 5
CacheGcInterval 4
CacheMaxExpire 24
CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
CacheDefaultExpire 1
NoCache no1.co.nz

Will work well at first, I had 4 users proxied to the server, after 
approx 30 mins use the log file grows out of control with above messages

Same problems with Virtual host (same ip) through port 8080

No sorry.

State-Changed-Why:
In your proxy directory, is there a file called .time? It
should have 644 permissions and be owned by the same user
and group as httpd and the proxy cache directory. I've run
a 2.5.1 Solaris proxy for about a week at work, without
seeing this problem. It appears to be related to creation
of the timestamp file in the proxy cache directory. The only
difference I can see at this time is in our compilers.
