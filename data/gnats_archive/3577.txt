apache does not compile with gcc -ansi on solaris 2.6 intel.
as all the source code looks pretty ansi (eg function declarations, void *...)
I guess this is a potential portability bug.

gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=260 -ansi `../apaci` ap_signal.c
ap_signal.c: In function `ap_signal':
ap_signal.c:68: storage size of `act' isn't known
ap_signal.c:68: storage size of `oact' isn't known
make[3]: *** [ap_signal.o] Error 1
m
>How-To-Repeat:
CFLAGS=-ansi CC=gcc ./configure
make
>Fix:
none.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Dec 22 09:01:33 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
It is complaining because sigaction isn't an ANSI feature.
Since Solaris supports it, however, we use it.  For platforms
that don't support it, we define NO_USE_SIGACTION in
ap_config.h so it isn't used.
