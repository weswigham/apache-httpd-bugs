>Release:        1.2.1
>Environment:
Solaris 2.5 with Apache 1.2.1 with patch "solaris_dup.patch"
Compiled with the proxy module
>Description:
When configuring apache as a proxy server, (ProxyRequests On)
with a corporate proxy-server, (ProxyRemote * http-proxy.fr.cis.philips.com)

the "NoProxy     130.142" directive is not recognized, and the server
doesn't wake up.

When the "NoProxy .." line is removed, every thing
is okay. Any station on the intranet can connect to my proxy, bouncing
on the corporate proxy, getting to he outside world ... Great ...
But I need the noproxy for the people who doesn't know how to
configure their Netscape for the local intranet servers.

It seems that the "NoProxy" command doesn't exists in the 
src/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c thow all the other commands are ...

This command is documented in the FAQ web page:
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_proxy.html#noproxy

Sincerely. Fred
>How-To-Repeat:
Just put the following lines in your httpd.conf file:
# Corporate proxy (for fire-wall protected intranet)
ProxyRemote * http-proxy.fr.cis.philips.com
# No proxy for the following addresses
NoProxy     130.142
# Proxy Server directives. Uncomment the following line to
# enable the proxy server:
ProxyRequests On

State-Changed-When: Fri Aug  1 09:24:59 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
As listed in the documentation, NoProxy is only
available in the 1.3 tree.  It is in 1.3a1, but that
release is alpha and not recommended for general use.

If you are fluent enough in C, you could take a look at
http://www.apache.org/websrc/cvsweb.cgi and try to patch
the changes in yourself.  The files that are involved in
that feature are mod_proxy.c, mod_proxy.h, proxy_ftp.c,
proxy_http.c and proxy_util.c.  This is, however, entirely
unsupported.
