RedHat Linux 6.2 (pretty much a standard installation, plus updates from RedHat)
>Description:
suexec appears not to be executed in a VirtualHost where the User/Group in the VirtualHost is the same as that of the main webserver
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a VirtualHost with a different User and Group as the main webserver (say, joe).  Then, create a cgi in that host's documentroot and set its file permissions such that it is executed correctly.  A suitable script would be:

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print `whoami`;

This will tell you who it thinks it's running as (joe).

Once you have set the owner and mode of the cgi and the directory it is in so that suexec will run it, go ahead and run it.  Check that it is the correct user, and that there is a log entry in the suexec_log file.

Now, modify that VirtualHost so that the user and group is the same as the main webserver (say, httpd).

Now, access the cgi again, and note that it is running as the webserver user.  This is defined behaviour, except:

  * You didn't change the file ownership or permissions on the cgi.
  * There is no log entry for the cgi in the suexec_log

Note: I checked the documentation (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html) and noted something.  I checked through the list of conditions that suexec checks, and point 10 (Is the target groupid ABOVE the minimum ID number?) should have triggered an error on my system.  Normal users are 500 and above, whereas httpd is 55.  Once again, note the lack of error message in suexec, and the fact that the script -did- successfully execute as httpd.
>Fix:
I suspect that the problem is somewhere in the Apache core, not suexec.  If it were in suexec, suexec should have complained about point 10 on that list.  I don't know how to fix it, but perhaps that might indicate where the problem lies...

State-Changed-Why:
This is the expected behaviour.  Suexec is only enabled
if the user or group specified is different than the
one for the main server.  In my opinion, this is the
most natural thing to do, and should not be changed.
However, you are correct that this should be documented
in the suexec docs.  I've marked this report as
"analyzed" so we can look at it when we improve the
suexec documentation.

Thanks for using Apache!

Hmmm... I guess "suspended" is a more appropriate state.
Sorry.
