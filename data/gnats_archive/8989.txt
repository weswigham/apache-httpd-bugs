cross platform problem
>Description:
The instructions for suexec say that in order to disable it, you should move the binary to a different name. So admin A does that.

Admin B comes along and sees a new Apache release, to fix a security hole. Admin B installs the new Apache, and doesn't realize that she needs to move the binary to a new name.

Voila, suexec is now enabled, user scripts break, chaos.

suexec should be disablable in the conf file. Then you can install new versions and not break anything. Also, then machines with many virtual servers can have a per server suexec config.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add an option to the httpd conf file to explicitly enable or disable suexec, with a default of enabled.
