this is an Intel Processor not Motorola
>Description:
Having downloaded and compiled / installed via (APACI) and install-bindist.sh for the downloaded binaries, I keep getting the same report in the error_log file : 
av37# more err*                                                              [

I have (to check) set the permissions and owner / group to root globally and tried to start as root, but no joy, same thing every time.

Please note I have 1.3.9 working on a Motorola DG/Ux but am I trying to run the correct version for Intel ?

Any thoughts, greatly appreciated.
