uname -a: Linux marley.zenox.dhs.org 2.2.5-22 #1 Wed Jun 2 09:17:03 EDT 1999 i686 unknown

Running RedHat 6.0. Apache installed from tarball and linked with PHP3.0.12
>Description:
I am using the following .htaccess file:
---------------------------------------
AuthUserFile /etc/shadow
AuthGroupFile /usr/local/apache/staff
AuthName "Zenox Staff Only"
AuthType Basic

require valid-user
---------------------------

The browser, be it NN or MSIE, always asks the user to input his password twice.
>How-To-Repeat:
You are not in my password file, but recreation of the problem on your system should be easy? Apache is linked with PHP (which is linked with MySQL and gd1.5)
>Fix:
I have not found one yet.

State-Changed-Why:
You are almost certainly accessing a directory without
including a trailing "/", as is required.  When Apache
corrects it, it has to send a redirect.  If that redirect
uses a different host name than the one you did originally,
you will have to authenticate again.  Either set your
ServerName to the same name that is used to access the server
or set "UseCanonicalName off".

 Including a trailing "/" fixes it. Thanks
