>How-To-Repeat:
Try this URL (where localhost is running the Apache server):
http://localhost/cgi-bin/echo.cgi?test

Note: echo.cgi must be an executable, not a script, to reproduce the bug.

This problem is closely related to problem 1256 which was reported elsewhere, but is
not the same problem. (That problem seems to be an inappropriate assert, it would seem).

>Fix:
It seems the arguments passed to create_argv are out of order. Here is what is
in my version of the code on util_script.c line 753:
	create_argv(r->pool, argv0, NULL, NULL, r->args, (void *) NULL), env);
when it appears that the "args" argument should come last. I think this
would be correct:
      create_argv(r->pool, argv0, NULL, NULL, argv0, r->args)

This is in a WIN32-specific block, and only in the case where it's executable or binary.

You are correct.  This change has already been made in
the development tree while fixing PR#1256.

Thanks for the report.
