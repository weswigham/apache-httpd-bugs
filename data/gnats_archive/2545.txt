SunOS horus 5.4 generic sun4m sparc
gcc version cygnus-2.0.2
>Description:
The following table shows all '200 HTTP OK' hits in a log file for a certain
period. Most 200s have a correct bytes sent value. With a DirectoryIndex file
(set to 'index.html') this is not always the case. I have briefly browsed
through the code, but was not able to find a relation between sending a
DirectoryIndex file or something else. The error log gives no futher info.
I've included the regexps used for filtering.

Searching for /[A-z0-9/]*/ in other access logs gives similar results.
