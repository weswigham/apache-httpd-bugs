Windows XP. Cold fusion 4.5 SP 1.
>Description:
Apache Multiviews will not 'guess' the .cfm extension, while it does work with, for example, .txt or .htm.

I had this working some time ago with, I think, CF4.5 original release (not sp1).

Config:

...
ClearModuleList
AddModule mod_coldfusion.c
<other standard modules>
...
DirectoryIndex index.cfm index.htm
...
<Directory c:/>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>
...

http://via.uvastudent.net:8080/index      (index.cfm, doens't)

>Fix:
'Register' this extension by hand or something like that?

 This can be worked around by adding
 
 AddHandler type-coldfusion .cfm
 
 for mod_mime. I've found that the Cold Fusion wrapper module discards
 anything that isn't called .cfm but you can hard code it like this. I've
 reported this to Macromedia.
 
 FYI: the wrapper code for the Cold Fusion module is now in the CF knowledge
 base.

Thanks for the confirmation that this is a coldfusion
problem and the suggested workaround.  It is logged here
