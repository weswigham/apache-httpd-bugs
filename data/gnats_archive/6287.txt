>Environment:
WIN95 JONSMIRL 4.0 67306684 xx I386
>Description:
Use of __declspec( thread ) prevents LoadLibrary from running on Win95. My module which does not use TLS is linked to ApacheCore.dll which does use TLS. When regsvr32 or regxpcom try to register my dll they are unable to load it.
>How-To-Repeat:
do this on Win95...
regsvr32 ApacheCore.dll
>Fix:
Is using GetProcAddress from my module for the Apache API the only way out? yuk!

Or could the TLS be dynamically allocated from ApacheCore's DLLMain?

State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 16 20:47:00 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

This has been changed in the mod_proxy of Apache 1.3.13,
you may wish to have a look at that module.  mod_proxy
was entirely broken due to TLS under Win9x.

As for dynamic thread storage allocation, that consideration
will have to wait for 2.0... so I've tagged your report
as analyzed till it can be debated at new-httpd@apache.org
mailing list.
