>Description:
We have the following process:

A HTML form submits to a Perl Script.

This script parses the request and creates a redierct with a "Location:" header.

The redirection is to a port that an Oracle Listener is on and the URL is an Oracle function which reads the database and displays results.

This all works fine in Netscape.
In IE 4 & 5, it complains that the page cannot be found.
Further more, if we copy and paste the URL from the address/URL field in IE, the Oracle function works fine.

The relevant bit of the cgi-script:

print "Content-type: text/html\nLocation: http://www2.carsales.com.au:8000/dig
ital/owa/Inventory.Query?dlrid=$in{'region'}&VMethod=QUICK&VType=Any+type&VMake=
$make&VModel=$model&VPrice=Any+price&Submit.x=28&Submit.y=13\n\n<html>\n"; 
>How-To-Repeat:
See the above bit of script.
>Fix:
To run the PERL script from the Oracle Webserver.
IE The action of the initial form will be to port 8000 (The Oracle Listener)
