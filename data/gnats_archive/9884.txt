This is from the MSI binary package, apache_2.0.32-beta-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi 

>Description:
I begin the installation and I choose 'Custom Installation'.   I accept all of the defaults.  The installation gets to the end of the installation and gives me the following error when it attempts to start Apache.

The instruction "0x6ee04052" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory could not be "read"
