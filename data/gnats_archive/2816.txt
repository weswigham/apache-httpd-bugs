Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi - or, if your browser
isn't forms-capable, you can send them via email to
apache-bugs@apache.org. If you don't wish to do the port
yourself, please submit this output rather than the patches.
Thank you

State-Changed-Why:
First, 1.2.4 is obsolete.  As the directions clearly tell
you before submitting a bug report, please try with a
current version of Apache.

Second, what exact operating system are you running on?
When was it installed?  "sun unix 4.0" doesn't have much
meaning.

This looks like it is a Solaris 2.5.1 system with something
hacked in a broken way to say "java" instead of SunOS.
