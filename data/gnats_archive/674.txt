State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, the username/password pair you supplied doesn't
appear to work.  I get an authorisation failure using
the URL and login information.

I'm using 1.2b11 here and it works correctly for me, so
I think we need to get the above problem fixed.  When we
access that URL, are we invoking the script you described
or something else?

Does the username show up in the access_log?  Or does it
get reported as "-"?

 As I already told you earlier today when you mailed me privately,
 YOU ARE NOT RESTRICTING ACCESS TO THE CGI.  You are restricting
 it to the sub directory.  There is no reason an access restriction for 
 the View_Stats directory should have anything to do with the cgi-bin
 directory.

State-Changed-Why:
The problem is that the CGI is being invoked as a separate
request, and is in a directory which isn't being protected
by the access control.  As a result, it requires no
authorisation to access, and hence no access control
information is passed to it.

Thanks for using Apache!
