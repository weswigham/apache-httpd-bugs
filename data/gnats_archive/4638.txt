>Release:        1.3b3
>Environment:
Unix 7Mplus 11.2 on Fujitsu K420 SPARC with Delta 3 applied, cc compiler,
320 Mb of memory and a Dual 75Mhz SPARC processor,
Apache is compiled configured as Unixware 2.1.2 as NX7MPlus is not shown.
>Description:
Prior to upgrading the K420 from 64MB and single 50Mhz SPARC processor, 
Apache worked well, with little processing required and many users online.

After upgrading to 320Mb memory and replacing the processor with
Dual 75Mhz SPARC processors, (and recompiling the Kernel) Apache refuses to 
work in more than single access mode, (i.e. only one browser may access 
it a time).

However, I have identified that by closing one processor (psradm -f 1), and 
allowing only processor 0 to run, Apache runs normally with full multi access)

I have checked that sufficient TCP sockets are configured (512 with only 185 
on average in use) as the error_log (Apache) was indicating SO_SNDBUF / SO_RCVBUF
and SO_SNDLOWAT / RCVLOWAT errors).

The problem appears to be that Apache can't run with dual processors (unless 
there is a configuration solution ?? - not apparent)


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Not at present, the only option appears to be to turn OFF the second processor,
which is counter-productive, as it was added to increase performance

State-Changed-Why:
First, as we ask before you submit a bug report, you need
to upgrade to a current version of Apache and not use a beta
from a year or two ago.

Apache has no "single access mode" in the way you describe,
and knows nothing about if a machine is SMP or not.  It is
up to the kernel to properly deal with that.  It looks like,
in this case, that your kernel has some problems with SMP
and there really isn't much we can do to debug or fix that...
