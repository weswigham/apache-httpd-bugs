Win 32 NT 4.0 (workstation) service pack 3
>Description:
After installing the downloaded .exe file on my d:\Program Files, I failed to 
install Apache as Service following the instructions under the title: Running
Apache for Windows.
I went to Control Panel > Services to try to locate Apache service without 
much luck. When I double click the "Install Apache as Service(NT only) icon,
there was a quick flash of DOS command window and then vanished. Nothing
happens afterward. Need help! Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
The behaviour of popping up a dos window briefly is normal.

After you clicked, "Install Apache as a service", did you
check to see if it showed up in the services panel?  You 
need to refresh the panel (close it and reopen it). Try issuing 'net start apache'. If it works, the Apache is installed
as a service.
