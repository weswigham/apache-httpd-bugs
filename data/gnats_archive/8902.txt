works fin on apache 1.3.12 and shows up a headline and a stupid text.
Using apache 2.0.28  I get

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu Nov 29 16:22:33 CET 2001
Server: Apache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<H1>ABC</H1>
bla

displayed in (m)any browser. When using telnet to the webserver(s) 
I get exactly the same text answer from both systems?!@
