>Description:
The <!--#exec cmd="program" --> SSI is broken.  The only way this will work
is if program is in the current working directory (the directory where the 
html file resides with the SSI).   Because lstat in suEXEC requires a
full path to the file your stating, but giving the full path will result in
another error, because a "/" (slash) is not allowed in the command to be
executed.

State-Changed-Why:
This should be fixed in 1.2b9.  If you could give that a try
that'd be great.  It hasn't been announced yet but it's in
the usual places.
