>Description:
This is the same as problem 4367, only I believe I have found where the problem occurs. I couldn't figure out a way to attach a comment to that report, so I filed another one instead.

The problem occurs when using chunked transfer-encoding, and the situation is that for small chunk sizes (needing less than 3 hex digits - or rather less than CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE-2), spaces are tacked on to the end, making sure that the whole chunk header is always 5 bytes. This doesn't seem to agree with the spec (rfc 2616, section 3.6.1), where my interpretation is that LWS is forbidden unless there is a chunk-extension present (the implied LWS rule is only valid between words and separators, and CRLF is not a word or separator).

Grepping through the code without really analysing anything, I think the following function in buff.c is where the problem happens:

/*
 * end a chunk -- tweak the chunk_header from start_chunk, and add a trailer
 */
static void end_chunk(BUFF *fb)
{
    int i;
    unsigned char *strp;

    if (fb->outchunk == -1) {
	/* not chunking */
	return;
    }

    if (fb->outchunk + CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE == fb->outcnt) {
	/* nothing was written into this chunk, and we can't write a 0 size
	 * chunk because that signifies EOF, so just erase it
	 */
	fb->outcnt = fb->outchunk;
	fb->outchunk = -1;
	return;
    }

    /* we know this will fit because of how we wrote it in start_chunk() */
    i = ap_snprintf((char *) &fb->outbase[fb->outchunk], CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE,
		"%x", fb->outcnt - fb->outchunk - CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE);

    /* we may have to tack some trailing spaces onto the number we just wrote
     * in case it was smaller than our estimated size.  We've also written
     * a \0 into the buffer with ap_snprintf so we might have to put a
     * \r back in.
     */
    strp = &fb->outbase[fb->outchunk + i];
    while (i < CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE - 2) {
	*strp++ = ' ';
	++i;
    }
    *strp++ = CR;
    *strp = LF;

    /* tack on the trailing CRLF, we've reserved room for this */
    fb->outbase[fb->outcnt++] = CR;
    fb->outbase[fb->outcnt++] = LF;

#ifdef CHARSET_EBCDIC
    /* Chunks are an HTTP/1.1 Protocol feature. They must ALWAYS be in ASCII */
    ebcdic2ascii(&fb->outbase[fb->outchunk], &fb->outbase[fb->outchunk], CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE);
    ebcdic2ascii(&fb->outbase[fb->outcnt-2], &fb->outbase[fb->outcnt-2], 2);
#endif /*CHARSET_EBCDIC*/

    fb->outchunk = -1;
}
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Make it possible to have a dynamic length of the chunk-size line (up to CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE, if necessary), and instead of tacking spaces on to the end, add CRLF and use zero-termination.
