>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
4.1.1-STABLE FreeBSD 4.1.1-STABLE #9
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
>Description:
Simply I set the login.conf default class to have a filesize limit of 7M.  Then
had a CGI script create a file larger than that.  The script executed and created a file much large than that.

There are several other things a user could do with memory limits either with bogging the server down or doing a DOS.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just create a quick CGI that would copy /dev/zero to the local dir.  It's a test that works (to say the least).  With suexec modified to do this it peacefully exists.
>Fix:
This code is NOT mine.  It was posted to the FreeBSD ISP mailing list in May of 1999 by a Andy Farkas (andyf@speednet.com.au).  It looked like a good idea so I gave it a shot. I noticed it wasn't in the current suxec and figured why not submit it.  His words were enjoy so I figured it would be ok to do so.
