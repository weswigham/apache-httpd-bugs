>Description:
This is a trick I use when I don't have ExecCGI. If I simply want a GET on a CGI
script, I do

<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/somescript.cgi" -->

While this logically makes sense, don't you think this is a HUGE security flaw?
Can we make it so that if an 'include virtual' is called, there's no way it can 
dip into pages ScriptAlias'd?

You can perform this on virtually any platform and, as far as I know, with any
version of Apache since SSI has been working decently.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set config file to use SSI and set Options IncludesNOEXEC.
Create a CGI script and create an SHTML page, stick the include tag in the 
SHTML page to point to the CGI script:

#!/bin/sh
echo "Go away"

<html><body><!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/goaway" --></body></html>
>Fix:
fix is obvious, as described in 'Full Description'
