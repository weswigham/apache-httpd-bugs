>Environment:
OS: NT 4 sp 5
JServ: from CVS as of 1999-08-29 
>Description:
The URL works fine with a Netscape client, 
but hangs a IE5 client (which eventually times out, after establishing a connection)

http://localhost/jserv/engine/0/

causes this to occur.

the only thing I can see which is different is IE5 is HTTP 1.1, but I switched it to 1.0 
and it still  is failing
>How-To-Repeat:
http://localhost/jserv/engine/0/
>Fix:
um... sorry.. no idea why one client is working and the other isn't...
