Windows NT 4.4  ...oops, sorry, ment to say "version 4.0 with Service Pack 4"
128 Meg RAM, Pentium processor, the whole deal.
>Description:
Downloaded apache_1_3_6_win32.exe
Run the program
I'm notified this will install Apache.  I click "Yes" to continue.
A dialog box mentioning InstallShield Wizard shows a progress meter, which
climbs to 49% and then skips quickly to 99% before vanishing.

I'm expecting another dialog box, or a big window asking me questions like
where I'd like to install it (or where the previous version is) but I don't
see such things.

The only evidence remaining that I ran the program is an entry on the Task
Manager's process list: "apache_1_3_6_wi" , consuming no CPU time, 1.2 Meg
of physical memory and 316kb of virtual memory.
If I run the program again without terminating the first process, I get
multiple PIDs named after this program, consuming the same amount of memory
and no CPU.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download apache_1_3_6_win32.exe to a Windows NT machine.
Run the program.
>Fix:
I'm thinking that rebuilding it using InstallShield Wizard might do it.
*shrug* A better solution would be if I could get a tarball (tar.gz) of the
new version and do any necessary WinNT Registry twiddling myself.

 I installed the software on another machine and copied the files over.
 
 I don't think the problem is with apache, actually.  A few hours later,
 Explorer.exe crashed (as it does about twice a day on me) and once I
 kickstarted the shell again with TaskMgr.exe, apache installed okay.
