State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!
>Unformatted:
I have installed Apache on my windows 95 machine to
test some cgi scripts.  I am using ActivePerl for
these scripts, but do not think that this is an issue.
 When I make a call to a web page containing a cgi
script, I get the message: 

Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal error or
misconfiguration and was unable to complete your
request.
Please contact the server administrator,
peter.jones@xxxxxxxx.com and inform them of the time
the error occurred, and anything you might have done
that may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in
the server error log.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache/1.3.6 Server at xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxx.com Port 80



When I check the log as shown I get the message:

[Tue Apr 27 12:07:27 1999] [error] [client
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] (2)No such file or directory:
couldn't spawn child process:
d:/apache/cgi-bin/login.cgi


I have made the changes to the handler to allow cgi
execution for this directory.  Please help.
