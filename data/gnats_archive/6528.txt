Debian Linux 2.2.10
>Description:
When run with --with-apxs, JServ's configure script does not query apxs for
CFLAGS.  This causes it to miss -DEAPI for Apache installations that were
compiled with EAPI for mod_ssl.

Of course this is possible to work around by compiling with --enable-EAPI, but
it would seem a little better to do this automatically.  (There is the remote
possibility of other issues caused by not obeying apxs's suggestions, too.)
