SunOS sunburn 5.7 Generic_106541-11 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
Server version: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)
>Description:
If you set up log rotation using cronolog or rotatelog utilities (piping logs to them in the httpd.conf file) then apache will hang after you give it a restart signal. 'apachectl restart' will hang the server as it doesn't seem to kill the pipe process. Graceful call works, but not restart.
>How-To-Repeat:
To repeat the problem, simply pipe access logs to a cronolog util using the pipe mechanism described in apache docs. Then do "apachectl restart"
