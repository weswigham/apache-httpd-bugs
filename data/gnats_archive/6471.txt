>Environment:
httpd.conf
>Description:
	The tuning docs make a strong argument for not using ExtendedStatus, but there's no warning about the slowdown in httpd.conf.

	There should probably be a similar note for the symlink setting.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Please add a comment to httpd.conf along the lines of:
# Warning: ExtendedStatus On adds two system calls to request. If your server is heavily loaded, avoid this setting.

State-Changed-Why:
In my opinion, httpd.conf is not really the place to 
document everything about Apache.  Anyone who is 
interested in performance and doesn't go to the 
manual is never going to get anywhere.
Thanks for the ideas, however, and thanks
for using Apache.
