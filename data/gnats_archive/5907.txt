Red Hat 6.1, using all defaults. Problem present in Apache 1.3.9 and 1.3.11 as well.
>Description:
Using the POSIX, Net::SMTPD, and/or Mysql mod_perl modules, or using PHP with 
MySQL 3.22.30 causes Apache to shutdown on startup. Removing those modules 
allows Apache to start. Using MySQL 3.20 with PHP also allows Apache to start.

Currently, I am using Apache 1.3.6 because that version works with this config.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache, mod_perl, mod_ssl, MySQL 3.22.30, pull down the latest CPAN 
modules (perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::CPAN') and the latest MySQL modules
(perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBD::mysql') and use this config:

PerlFreshRestart On
PerlSendHeader   Off
PerlModule       Apache::Registry
PerlModule       Mysql
PerlModule       POSIX
PerlModule       CGI
PerlModule       Net::SMTP

<Location /perl-status>
   SetHandler    perl-script
   PerlHandler   Apache::Status
   Order deny,allow
   Deny from all
   Allow from .linif.org
</Location>
