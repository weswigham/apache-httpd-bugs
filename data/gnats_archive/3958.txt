>Description:
If I mistype:

./configure --enable-module=mod-speling

as:

./configure --enable-modules=mod-speling

I get no error, but apache builds without mod-speling.  In fact --enable-XXX
is ignored if XXX is unknown.  I think this deserves an error message to avoid
the pitfall of mis-spelling a --enable-XXX option and having it ignored.

There are similar issues for --disable-XXX.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --enable-modules=mod-speling
>Fix:
Add a "*)" catch-all to report this error at lines 711 and 769 of configure.

 Thanks for catching this. The suggested error handling 
 is now added for Apache 1.3.5.
