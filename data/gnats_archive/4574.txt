>Environment:
Redhat Linux 2.0.36
GNU C
Default Apache installation
>Description:
Run configure using a default set of options causes the Java JServ modules to build
and install but the mod_jserv module fails to build with an error:

Make:  nothing to do for 'all' in src/c

I am using a default Redhat 5.2 installation with no patches or updates other 
than those shipped with the standard CD.  Apache 1.3.3 was installed by Redhat 
into a default set of directories and is running fine.  The JAVA_HOME and 
JSDK_HOME variables are set and the Java compiler is working fine.  

Java compiler and VM is Blackdown JDK1.1.6v2.  Very stable.

>How-To-Repeat:
Run ./configure after unpacking the tar file on a standard Redhat system with
no options and then run make.
>Fix:
No suggestions, as tracing the Makefiles is giving me a headache.  I have seen
many problem reports related to this and I *need* to run JServ on my Apache 
server.  I would settle for a simple manual Makefile that *works*.

Could a developer please look into this or at least provide the necessary 
include and build parameters for GCC so I can build the modules by hand and 
instructions to move them manually into their proper locations.

Any help on this is greatly appreciated, as I am sure there are many others 
with the same problem who just want a product that works right.

State-Changed-Why:
That is not an error message. What happens is that you are not reading the directions in the INSTALL document very closely and that is why things are not working. Running ./configure without any options is not enough. Please read the directions more closely.
