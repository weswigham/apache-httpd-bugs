>Description:
[root@emu apache_1.3.2]# /usr/sbin/apachectl configtest
/usr/sbin/apachectl: kill: (8369) - No such pid
httpd: module "(null)" is not compatible with this version of Apache.
Please contact the vendor for the correct version.


This error prevents apache from starting (hence serious). What I want to know is which statement causes the error,.

here's how it's built:
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/httpd/conf\
   --localstatedir=/var \
   --logfiledir=/var/log/httpd \
   --enable-module=most \
   --enable-shared=max
make

See above
