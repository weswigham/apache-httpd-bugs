           I want to compile this under GNU/WIN32 (Unix kernel that runs
on top of Windows 95 and Windows NT). I did ./configure on the 95 machine
and I got:

Sorry, but we cannot grok "i586-whatever-CYGWIN32_95|4.0|17.6"
uname -m
i586
uname -r
4.0
uname -s
CYGWIN32_95
uname -v
17.6
uname -X
uname: invalid option -- X
Try `uname --help' for more information.

NOTE: Windows NT has slightly different output.

GNUWin/32 beta 18
(see Environment). Compiler doesn't work, and try to "redirect" it to
other OSes don't seem to work after compiling. Take a look.
>How-To-Repeat:
Gnu is available at http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32

State-Changed-Why:
It would be desirable for someone to provide a port to GNU/Win-32
but we're not likely to make it a priority at the moment.  I
believe someone else has already done the port ... maybe you can
find the patch via hotbot or something like that.  If you do find it
please send us a copy.

Version 1.3 of the server will contain a native WIN32 port.
