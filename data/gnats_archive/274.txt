>Environment:
BSDI 2.1
All patches installed
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
We have 3 machines that host around 500 virtual sites (2 class C's).  We have been running apache 1.1.1
on all of the servers for several months.  I have downloaded, configured, and compiled the 1.2b7 source.
When I enter 249 VirtualHosts or less, all works well.  When I enter 250 VirtualHosts, the browser displays
"document contains no data".  When I enter 251 VirtualHosts, the daemon hangs.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enter 251 Virtualhosts in the httpd.conf and see it happen.
>Fix:
Not reall

State-Changed-When: Fri Apr  4 11:32:24 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This is commonly caused by an exhaustion of file descriptors.
Each virtual host consumes several for housekeeping functions
as well as for serving documents, and you may be running
into this limit.  Check out your system's "limit" or "ulimit"
command to see how many are available to the process starting
the server, and see if your OS will allow you to increase
the number.  If that doesn't work, please let us know.
