>Environment:
SunOS 5.6, gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
The "cd subdir; make" parts of the makefile will not work for more than
one module because the current working directory is changed and not restored.
The "cd subdir; make" needs to be wrapped in parenthesis so the cd occurs
in a subshell.
>How-To-Repeat:
Place more than one module in the modules directory, add it to the MODULES
variable in the modules Makefile, build.
>Fix:
