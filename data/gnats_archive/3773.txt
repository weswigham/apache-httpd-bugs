>Environment:
Linux 2.0.34
>Description:

When I generate an NDMB file on Linux, it creates a
foo.db file, not foo.pag and foo.dir.

In mod_rewrite.h, it says:

#if (__FreeBDS__)
#defile NDBM_FILE_SUFFIX ".db"
#else
#define NDBM_FILE_SUFFIX ".pag"
#endif

This sets the NDBM_FILE_SUFFIX to ".pag" on my Linux
box, but my Linux box uses a suffix of ".db" for NDBM
files.

>How-To-Repeat:
implement mod-rewrite on Linux 2.0.34 and Apache 1.3.4
and use:

RewriteMap foo       dbm:/fee/fi/fo/fum/dbmfile

-- mod_rewrite will attempt to open dbmfile.pag instead of dbmfile.db

Thanks for the hint.
