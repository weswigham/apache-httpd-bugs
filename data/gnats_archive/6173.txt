>Description:
I installed a Linux machine(with static IP),and tried out a CGI script for discussion forum and its working perfectly.Now ,when I posted the same in our webserver having virtual domains,the pages without frames are displayed correctly .But pages with frames are displayed with "page cannot be displayed" in IE5.0 and "document contains no data" in Netscape.Is that because I use a proxy IP in my machine to view it ? My browser is configured well to display frames and my connection is good.
