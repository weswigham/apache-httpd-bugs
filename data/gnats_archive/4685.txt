info for that.


   The problem described in PR4584 coms about when you wish to run Apache as root.

   You get a message about having to rebuild with -DBIG_SECURITY_HOLE

   The problem is that the message says to add it to src/Configuration.  In fact
(at least when using configure) you need to set CFLAGS in your environment.

   So, the text output from src/main/http_cors.c: line 1902 is wrong, which is what
the bug really is.  This is not mentioned in PR4584.

   
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
   Change the text to reflect the current method of configuring Apache.

State-Changed-Why:

In 1.3, how to do this depends on how you built apache.
These instructions are correct if you used
src/Configuration.

Anyway, I fixed it in the 2.0 version.

Thanks for using Apache!
