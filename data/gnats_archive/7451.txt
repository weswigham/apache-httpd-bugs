Linux
>Description:
I installed apache on my linux machine, when I run it (i.e. apachectl start),
It indicates that it has started, but there is no process running. Moreover, the
error log file does not indicate that there is an error. When I stop apache
(i.e. apachectl stop) It says (no pid running).

HELP!

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
