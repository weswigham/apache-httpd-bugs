>Release:        1.2.6+SSL 1.6
>Environment:
Running: freebsd 2.2.6 (kernel has maxusers=256) - trying to figure out the 
best environment to run apache under to avoid problems, but concerned that this
is an Apache problem.  This is the ben-ssl patch to 1.26 and runs well except..
>Description:
My OS/environment vars seem to be up to par, BUT I'm getting errors trying to
execute cgi-bin apps from ApacheSSL if x users/requests hit the server simultaneously.
also getting: "fork: Resource temporarily unavailable".

The OS, FH limits and all that seem to be properly set - ulimit=unlimited, etc.
Maybe some superficial advice on the startup shell script?  But not sure if
this is the problem.  I know AP-SSL is a slightly different monster, but running
1.26 on the same machine with no problems - just the SSL version dies sometimes
when trying to run cgi - intermittently.  Please advise.  Been changing various Max/min
spare/client settings to no avail.
>How-To-Repeat:
call cgi from AP-ssl with more network calls than matches the number of current
server processes - the number does not seem to expand.
>Fix:
Not sure - calling environment?  Bug in SSL patch?  Misconfiguration?  Trying
to find an answer....

State-Changed-Why:
Can you try reproducing this on a vanilla Apache server?
That is, one with the SSL patch not applied?  If the
problem doesn't recur under those conditions I'm afraid
it points to the SSL patch, and there's nothing we can do
about that.  We haven't received any other reports of this
specific message.
