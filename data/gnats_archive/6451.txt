>Description:
Setup 1: The server machine has one IP address (111.22.33.44) which resolves to the name server.domain.tld. There are two aliases (CNAMEs) www.domain.tld and www.sub.domain.tld for the address 111.22.33.44.

Due to the fact that www.domain.tld has the highest priority it can be seen as the default or primary server.

We want to use a virtual host for the alias www.otherdomain.tld and one virtual host should catch any request to hostnames of the form *.sub.domain.tld with www.sub.domain.tld as its server name. 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Setup 1: The server machine has one IP address (111.22.33.44) which resolves to the name server.domain.tld. There are two aliases (CNAME or A records) www.domain.tld and www.sub.domain.tld for the address 111.22.33.44.

www.domain.tld appears first, so it is the 'highest priority' or default server.

We want to use a virtual host for the alias www.otherdomain.tld and another virtual host (server name www.sub.domain.tld) should catch any requests to hostnames of the form *.sub.domain.tld.
