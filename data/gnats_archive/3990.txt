>Description:
I have ported Apache 1.2.6 on a BULL mainframe unix (DPS 7000 / Open7) which is a ATT unix based that is a subsystem of the GCOS 7. It works very well except the SSI. The problem is I try to get a file with suffix .shtml, I have AddHandler server-parsed .shtml but the code didn't get to the server-parse handler at all. I would like to trace the code, please inWe have ported apache 1.2.6 on a BULL mainframe unix (DPS 7000 / Open7) which is a ATT unix based (system 5.3) that is a subsystem of the GCOS 7.
It works very well except the SSI.
The problem is, I try to get a file with suffix .shtml from netscape, and the file is gotten as the html ordinary file, the SSI command is not parsed.
I have put AddHandler server-parsed .shtml in srm.conf, and AddType text/html shtml,
but the code didn't get to the server-parse handler at all (because I have put a little trace in the server-parse handler that did not come out). 
I would like to trace the code, please in which module must I start and which area must I dump.
I want to know how apache treat a request according to suffixe.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
May be it is a problem of the portage in our platform. I want just to know the way to debug and the right place to put traces.

State-Changed-Why:
Well you also need to add Includes to the Options directive...
But it sounds like it may be something specific to your port,
and I'm not really sure what to say.  Have you tried porting
1.3.x yet?
