>Description:
Hi, when i try to stop httpd using httpd stop, it is unsuccessful (FAILED), although, if i try httpd start it is successful (OK).  I tried to look at the home page to see if it actually was successful, but it doesn't seem to be, because i get the "Page cannot be found" error.  The error_log is empty.  Here is a little history of the messages i get:
[root@oddjob init.d]# ./httpd start
Starting httpd:   OK  ]
[root@oddjob init.d]# ./httpd stop
Shutting down http: FAILED]
[root@oddjob init.d]# ./httpd status
httpd is stopped
[root@oddjob init.d]# ./httpd start
Starting httpd:   OK  ]
[root@oddjob init.d]# ./httpd status
httpd dead but subsys locked

Everything was working perfectly previously.  I think this may have happened after i installed php4.

 I tried commenting out all of the php stuff in httpd.conf, but this made no
 changes! I still get the same errors.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jun 29 14:22:24 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

You are obviously using some third-party distribution
of Apache that comes with a modified start-up script.
The version of httpd we distribute does not take options
like "start" and "stop".  Unfortunately, since we know
nothing about this script you are using, we cannot help.
Please contact the provider of your Apache distribution.

Thanks for using Apache!
