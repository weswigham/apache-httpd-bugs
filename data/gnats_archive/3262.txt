>Unformatted:
This bug sounds like Jeff Baker's reported problem in bug database
#2723.

For the past two weeks Apache has been dying with this error:

[emerg] (9)Bad file number: flock: LOCK_EX: Error getting accept lock. Exiting!

Sometimes the error just kills a client, and sometimes the root
server.  The root server comes down at least once a day, usually when
I'm away from the office (this means that it does NOT correspond to
heavy usage periods).  The problem was occurring with Apache 1.3.1 and
is still occurring with Apache 1.3.3.

Configuration:

	Slackware Linux 2.0.33
	libc 5.4.33
	Apache 1.3.3
	mod_perl 1.16

I've changed the define USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT TO
USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to see if that makes any difference.   Let 
me know if there's anything else I can do to track down this problem.

Jeff says that the problem went away on his end when he upgraded to
glibc 6.
