Tested on Linux and AIX; probably everything
>Description:
When a user makes a proxy request against Apache and mod_proxy isn't loaded,
Apache simply ignores the hostname from the URI and processes the request as
if it was local, even if the hostname isn't valid for that server. However,
RFC 2616, section 5.2 says that a 400 (Bad Request) code should be returned
instead.

>How-To-Repeat:
Connect to an Apache server without mod_proxy loaded.

GET http://www.apache.org/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.apache.org
Connection: close

You'll get the local content instead of www.apache.org's.
