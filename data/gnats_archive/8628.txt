>Description:
Basically, if Apache has to resolve a URI using multiviews, then it discards the query_string part of the request.

In the examples below, you will note that QUERY_STRING has content with the qtest.cgi requests, but not with the qtest requests.

It's quite possible that this bug was introduced as a sideeffect to fixing the bug mentioned in the 1.3.22 release notes, but don't hold me to that:
     * A vulnerability was found when Multiviews are used to negotiate
       the directory index. In some configurations, requesting a URI with
       a QUERY_STRING of M=D could return a directory listing rather than
       the expected index page.  CAN-2001-0731


The qtest.cgi script consists of:
---------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use CGI;
use Data::Dumper;

my $q = new CGI;
print $q->header(), $q->start_html('Hi!');
print $q->pre(Dumper(\%ENV,$q->param));
print $q->end_html;
