>Environment:
Linux syd001 2.0.33 #2 Wed Jun 10 06:54:28 CDT 1998 i486

1.2.6 compiled under
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-pc-linux-gnulibc1/egcs-2.90.27/specs
gcc version egcs-2.90.27 980315 (egcs-1.0.2 release)

Also 1.2.1 showed the same problem and that was compiled under
gcc 2.7.2.2

libc5.4.* libraries used (1.2.6 build operating with libc5.4.44)
>Description:
Sorry if this is a dumb configuration setup on my part but I couldn't find any
reference to it under bug reports, FAQ or in the main documentation.

What I was looking at was how the VirtualHost configuration was affected by
the alias command.  What I found seems a bit surprising, but perhaps I am doing
something wrong.

When I apply an alias within the <VirtualHost > directive pair, the alias only
applies to the virtual host, and not the default (which is what I would expect).

Using the example, if I access http://syd001.ads.com.au/Virtua/ I get a
'File Not Found' error page. Accessing http://syd001.ads.com.au:443/Virtua/
gives me the content I expect (content contained in /home/httpsd/htdocs).

When I apply an alias command to the default host, and an alias to the virtual
host, I get the expected results.

So accessing http://syd001.ads.com.au/Virtua/ gives me the content in
/home/web/VirtuaContent, and accessing http://syd001.ads.com.au:443/Virtua/
give the content in /home/httpsd/htdocs.

However, when I apply an alias to only the default host, the virtual host also
seems to recognise the alias and refers to the smae directory.  I also cleared
browser cache to ensure that this wasn't affecting the observed results.

Again, in the example, access to http://syd001.ads.com.au/Virtua/ gives me the
content in /home/web/VirtuaContent but http://syd001.ads.com.au:443/Virtua/ also
gives me access to /home/web/VirtuaContent.

Finally as a test reference, if I take out all aliasing, I get 'File Not Found'
pages for both http://syd001.ads.com.au/Virtua/ and
http://syd001.ads.com.au:443/Virtua/

Note that I am using a plain Apache compile (no SSL).  I apologise that I
haven't got around to testing the Apache 1.3 against it yet.
>How-To-Repeat:
My virtual host test setting.

<VirtualHost syd001.ads.com.au:443>
	ServerAdmin jonb@syd001.ads.com.au
	DocumentRoot /home/httpsd
	ServerName syd001.ads.com.au
	ErrorLog logs/test-error_log
	TransferLog logs/test-access_log
	<Directory /home/httpsd/htdocs>
	        options Indexes ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
	</Directory>
#	Alias /Virtua /home/httpsd/htdocs
</VirtualHost>

I have in the srm.conf the line following line and this Alias should refer to
the default host:
#        Alias /Virtua /home/web/VirtuaContent

The ServerRoot is defined as
    ServerRoot /home/web

Trialling the various combinations of the Alias lines being 'commented out/not
commented out' gave me the results I reported.
>Fix:
This seems to be a logic error in interpreting the configuration.  Since it was
there in 1.2.1 and still there in 1.2.6, I would assume that it has only come
about because of the introduction of the virtual hosting directives.  I haven't
investigated the code yet to determine the fix for it.

Correct, most such directives are inherited by vhosts.
This isn't overly well documented, but isn't that hard to
determine by trying it.

If you don't want this to happen, the easiest way around it
is to just make your "main" server a vhost.

 In essence then, what we are saying is that Alias, ScriptAlias and similar 
 directives when used outside the scope of VirtualHost, do not apply solely to 
 the default server as such, but are instead global declarators.
