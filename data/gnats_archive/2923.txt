Not Found

The requested URL /server-status was not found on this server.

I have the following lines in the access.conf file:

SetHandler server-status
order deny,allow
allow from all
</Location>

This looks to be set up just as the directed in the Apache Documentation,
but I appear to be missing something.

 Does anything appear in the error log?
 
 Do you have mod_status compiled into your server?

 Here is the error log
 
 [Fri Aug 28 17:08:30 1998] [notice] httpd: caught SIGTERM, shutting down
 [Fri Aug 28 17:08:39 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.1 (Unix) configured --
 resuming normal operations
 [Fri Aug 28 17:08:49 1998] [warn] handler "server-status" not found for:
 /www/apache/share/htdocs/server-status
 [Fri Aug 28 17:08:49 1998] [error] File does not exist:
 /www/apache/share/htdocs/server-status
 
 I thought I had mod-status compiled into the serve, but it doesn't look
 like it is.  To do the build, I edited the src/Configuration file  to
 include
     	AddModule modules/standard/mod_status.o
 
 then in the src parent directory (using the APACI build method), I did
 	configure --prefix=/www/apache
 	make
 	make install
 
 This produced an executable httpd file in the /www/apache/sbin directory as
 desired.
 
 However, it looks like  mod_status was not included.  When I look in the
 src/module/standard directory, I do not see a mod_status.o file, and when I
 just rebuilt and watched the messages go by, I did not see a compilation of
 the mod_status.c file to create a mod_status.o
 
 Therefore, I concluded that the build using the APACI did not add in the
 mod_status module.
 
 I even tried manually editing the Configuration.apaci file to include
 mod_status, but that did not include it into the executable.
 
 I tried again using the Configuration.tmpl method from the src directory.
 The difference this time is that in the src directory, I again edited the
 src/Configuration file  to include
     	AddModule modules/standard/mod_status.o
 
 Then I did:
 
 	./Configure
 	make
 
 This appeared to compile the mod_status module, as I saw it get compiled
 while building the executable that is made in the src directory.  However,
 I want to put the server root in a nonstandard place  (/www/apache) .  This
 build method assumes that the server root is /usr/local/apache and builds
 it into the httpd executable.  When started up, this httpd file tries to
 read the config files from/usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
 
 The APCI build method has a method for specifying the server root.  I guess
 the solution to my problem is to figure out how to make the
 Configuratiom.tmpl build method let me specify the server root.  Is there a
 simple way that I am missing?
 
 
 I tried adding the line
 
 HTTP_ROOT = /www/apache
 
 to the Configuration file
 
 but this did not help
 
 
 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 
 
 Thanks
 
 Ray

 No.  Please go through the docs on apaci; you can _NOT_ edit your
 Configuration file if you expect to use it.
 
 Read the README.configure file for how to add modules using apaci.

 OK,  I was finally able to build using the APACI method and put the
 executable where I want it.
 
 What I think is happening  is that the APACI method uses
 src/Configuration.tmpl and ignores src/Configuration and
 src/Configuration.apaci
 
 I got it to work by making Configuration.tmpl include the mod_status
 module.  I watched it get compiled and then yhe executable got made.
 
 Now I can see the server-status page.

 OK,  I see what I should have done.
 
 
 Thanks.
