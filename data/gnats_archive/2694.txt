Perl for Win32 (www.activestate.com/pw32) 5 Build 316
>Description:
refering to PR#2294 apache for windows has had problems with envirolment-variables(REMOTE_ADDR, REQUEST_METHOD, REQUEST_METHOD); although in at least REMOTE_ADDR seems to work in my release, my perl does not receive any command-lines (or as you call it, searchstrings) of $ENV{"QUERY_STRING"}.
>How-To-Repeat:
write a cgi print $ENV{"QUERY_STRING"}; and call the_cgi_file.cgi?with_an_parameter
>Fix:
the problem might be connected with the the windows wildcard function of ?; or ? is not the "official" way to call parameters (although Sambar Server (www.sambar.com) works with it fine)
