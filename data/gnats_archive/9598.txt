>Environment:
Linux 2.2.19 (no patches), gcc 2.95.2 (no patches)
>Description:
When a response is cached by mod_proxy with the "expires" and "last-modified" headers is RFC822 date format with the zone field in the format ("+" / "-") 4DIGIT (e.g. "+0100") the cache response does not expire as expected. It does expire when the zone field is set to "GMT".
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a response with the "expires" and "last-modified" header in RFC822 date format with the zone field in the format ("+" / "-") 4DIGIT. E.g.:

Last-Modified: Sat, 26 Jan 2002 01:06:20 +0100
Expires: Sat, 26 Jan 2002 01:11:20 +0100

This respone will generate a HIT even when the timestamp of "expires" has passed. If you use GMT as your time zone the response will expire as expected. E.g.:

Last-Modified: Sat, 26 Jan 2002 00:06:20 GMT
Expires: Sat, 26 Jan 2002 00:11:20 GMT
>Fix:
Accept RFC822 compatible dates for these crucial mod_proxy header response fields as the RFC822 date format is commonly used by http servers and clients.
