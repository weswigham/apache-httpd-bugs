It's a problem with perl. Use perl5.005_56 or newer. (As figured out on the modperl list)

 Problem was solved in, and by rebuilding with, Perl 5.005_56.

Foo, pressed the wrong button by mistake.  Submitter says
problem was fixed by rebuilding with a different version
of Perl.

With

  Sun ultra 170 
  solaris 2.6 -- required and recommended patches up to May
  gcc-2.81 
  apache-1.3.6
  perl5.00503
  mod_perl-1.19

I build php3 with apxs as a DSO, and apache loads libphp3.so at
startup and runs it just fine.

But building mod_perl with apxs as a DSO, apache dumps core
with a segment violation while loading and initializing libperl.so.

The outcome is unchanged whether or not I

  compile apache from source or use the binary 2.6 distribution 
  use the perl5 malloc or not
  set the flags to use gcc's ld or not  

Has anyone actually gotten apache to successfully load and
run a mod_perl dso on solaris 2.6?  Does the gdb output below 
suggest what's going wrong?

Should I build mod_perl statically, and go with dso's for
everything else?

  orlik{2}# gdb -c core httpd
  GNU gdb 4.18

  This GDB was configured as "sparc-sun-solaris2.6"...
  Core was generated by `/apache/bin/httpd -d /apache'.
