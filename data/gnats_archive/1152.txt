>Description:
The server has DNS lookup for clients enabled.  Ever so often, the server
cannot resolve the name of the client and is stuck in "D" (DNS) mode, even
if the request is properly served.
Eventually,
all available servers are stuck in "D" mode and the server is rendered inoperable.
Both the server and NAMED appear to function perfectly outside of this problem.
The servers stuck in "D" are flushed out (resolve their client name and
continue with normal operation) when NAMED is given a SIGHUP.  
>How-To-Repeat:
If you look at http://www.cs.earlham.edu/server-status you can see the
symptoms of the problem (unless an administrator has SIGHUPed NAMED, which
we are having to do at least once every day.
>Fix:
As mentioned, sending a SIGHUP to NAMED flushes out the stuck servers as
a temporary solution.  Beyond that...%3

State-Changed-Why:
I'm really not sure that this is an Apache problem or that
we can do anything about it.  If the DNS query isn't timing
out, then your DNS server is not properly timing out.
If you can't make it work correctly, you may need to
turn off reverse DNS lookups.

What version of BIND are you using?  Try upgrading it.

Try pointing your machine at another name server on your
site that has a better version of named.

It would be possible to try modifying the timeouts for
name resolution, but I doubt that will help too much since
it is broken already.

The fact that restarting named fixes it indicates that
named is blocking in a query and not properly returning
an answer or a failure as it should.

 If you do a nslookup on one of the IPs that isn't being resolved,
 does it return properly?
 
 You could try adding something like:
 
         _res.retrans = 1;
         _res.retry = 1; 
 
 (you will probably need an #include <resolv.h> at the top of the
 file too) to the start of main() in http_main.c.  .retrans is the
 retransmission interval, retry is the # of times to retry.
 
 This should work if your BIND is anything near standard.
 
 I am not convinced this will help, though, since it should be
 eventually timing out anyway but it obviously isn't.

 Thank you for your reply.
 
 We have resinstalled named, bind, and other related services in previous
 attempts to solve this problem with no success.
 
 I realize that it would likely be a waste of your time to try to fix a
 problem so deeply involving "foreign" software but I believe the people
 working on it on this end have looked at many if not all of the angles and
 come up empty handed, and so I was "hoping" it would be something in the
 Apache code.
 
 Perhaps you could just tell me where to find the source where I might
 modify the DNS lookup timeouts?
 
 Thanks for your time,
 Chris Hardie
