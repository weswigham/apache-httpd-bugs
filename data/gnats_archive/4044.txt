>Environment:
OSF1 remus.umd.edu V4.0 878 alpha
>Description:
The use of the IncludesNoExec option in a <Directory> block, causes the following JavaScript
code, <SCRIPT>document.write(document.lastModified)</SCRIPT> to return 12/31/69 19:00:00.
If the IncludesNoExec option is removed then the JavaScript code returns the correct date 
and time.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add the IncludesNoExec to a <Directory> block and add the following JavaScript code,
<SCRIPT>document.write(document.lastModified)</SCRIPT> to any page in that directory 
and view the results.  Then remove the IncludesNoExec option, restart server and reload
the same page(you may need to clear your cache).

State-Changed-Why:
No, there is no problem.  All that javascript is telling you
is that the document has no last-modified date.  that is
completely natural and true if you enable mod_include on
a document.  See the mod_include docs for details.
