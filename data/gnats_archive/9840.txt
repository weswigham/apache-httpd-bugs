>Environment:
i586 based system running SuSE 7.2 professional 'out of the box'. downloaded Apache 1.3.23  gcc compiler
>Description:
Using Apache 1/3/19 as supplied with SuSE is no problem. Configure 1.3.23 for SuSE and install and suddenly get 
"Invalid command 'LoadModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included  in the server configuration" 

This affects both the standard modules and the SuSE includes.  tried using 1.3.19 with same config file and worked ok

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Sun Feb 17 15:11:53 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

The error message goes on to say "Perhaps misspelled or
defined by a module not included in the server."  The
second option is the important one.  You can't use
LoadModule unless you included mod_so when you 
compiled Apache.

In the future, please ask basic support question like
this on a user support forum such as the ones suggested
in the FAQ.

Thanks for using Apache!
