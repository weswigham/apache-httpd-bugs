State-Changed-Why:
If you could provide some feedback on this one we would
be able to help more.
Please provide what you mean by:
"Apache crashes when exiting,"
DO you mean exiting Win98 or exiting Apache.
How are you 'exiting' apache.  Are you using a Control C
in a DOS window?  Are there any active connections while
you are trying to exit?  Also another possibility is to
upgrade to Apache 1.3.3 which IIRC has the new
-k option...which allows a 'graceful' shutdown of Apache

Please let us know, and thanks for using Apache.
