>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 95, 4.00.950B
Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0
>Description:
The size of the cache directory continues to grow, regardless of the 
garbage collection settings in httpd.conf.

Haven't tried this under WinNT - may or may not be a problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile mod_proxy into apachecore.dll, and run on Win95. Use a small cache dir
size, and short GC interval so the problem doesn't take too long to test. 
>Fix:
Win95 needs to be treated like the EMX port in some ways, and the UNIX version
in others. I have a version which seems to work - here's a diff against the
1.3b5 version of proxy_cache.c
