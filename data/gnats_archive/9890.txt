Windows 2000 Server, sp2
>Description:
When trying to start apache from the Services menu, get a "Could not start apache service on this computer.  Did not return an error" message.  When I do apache -k runservice from the command prompt, get:

E:\Apache2\bin>apache -k runservice
(23563)The service process could not connect to the service controller.  : Error
 starting service control dispatcher
[Wed Feb 20 14:28:01 2002] [crit] (20012)No thread was provided and one was requ
ired.: Apache2: Unable to start the service manager.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run apache 2.0.32 as a service on windows 2k server.
>Fix:
n/a

State-Changed-When: Thu Feb 21 21:45:39 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
Dup of bug report PR 9863... We hope to have a new installer
for testing sometime over this weekend.  ITMT, change to
the c:\program files\apache group\apache2 folder, and the
command;

bin\apache -k install -n apache2

should fix things.

Your attempt to -k runservice from the command line was
hopeless, since that option [undocumented] only works
when the Windows NT Service Control Manager invokes the
service from the kernel.

Thanks for trying the 2.0.32 BETA!

 Thanks.  This worked like a charm.
 
 Download times have been 6-10x faster over our internal network with 2.0 
 over 1.3.
