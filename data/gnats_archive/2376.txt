 Is there some reason you are trying to use both dbm and db at the same
 time?  Don't compile both in unless you really have to because there can
 be some interactions between them.
 
 You need to be more specific about the probem; eg. what shows up in the
 error log.

 no, not really. it was a feeling, that this can be a way to solve my
 problem.

 yes, first at all, i compile only the auth_dbm modul in, because it is the
 only i need for my httpd.

 in the errorlog was only a message, that the DBM user was not found.

 Did you have a line like below before that line in your error log?
 
 [Sun Jun  7 13:24:04 1998]  [error] (2)No such file or directory:
 could not open dbm auth file: blahblah
 
 dbmmanage seems to use Berkeley db by default. I'm guessing that
 mod_auth_dbm is looking for a dbm file but isn't finding it because a
 DB file is there instead. Could you try switching to mod_auth_db?
