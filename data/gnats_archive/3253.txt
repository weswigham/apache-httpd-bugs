>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
Apache 1.3.3
JServ 19981019
Sun JDK 1.1.7
Sun Jre 1.1.7
>Description:
jserv_wrapper_win.c does not handle the bin.parameters command line arguments
correctly.  It simply concatenates the pointer to the cfg->binparam to the
command line argument string.  This results in random data being passed to the
java runtime.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply specify command line parameters to the java runtime.
>Fix:
Yes.  Context diff included.

State-Changed-When: Mon Oct 26 00:06:41 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This should be fixed in the latest version in CVS
(19981026 or later).  If you could try that version and
report any problems (to me or the list), I'd really
appriciate that.  I'm unable to test it, since I don't have
a recent MSVC++ with which to compile it on Win32...
