>Description:
it would be nice if apache would allow multiple lines for ServerAlias
the reason (at least for our company) is when we delete a site (virtualhost) we put that site's domain name either as a serveralias to our main site or as a serveralias to a "Site Deleted" site.  This way, people going to the site will see this page or error.  The problem is there is only room for about 7 sites on one line.

State-Changed-Why:

Is there some reason continuation lines won't do this for
you?  E.g.,

    ServerAlias \
        vhost1 \
        vhost2 \
          :
        vhostn

 Isn't using the line continuation feature (a backslash at the end: `\') on
 option for you?
