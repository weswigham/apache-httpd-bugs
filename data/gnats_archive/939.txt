>Environment:
NT Workstation 4.0 (german, x86) with Service Pack 3 (no hotfixes)
Visual C++ 4.0
ODBC 2.x/3.0
>Description:
I've written a CGI app (with VC++ 4.0) that uses ODBC to do some stuff on
a database. The app works fine when it is invoked from the command line or
from IIS but when Apache starts it, I get a wierd GPF in my CGI app. The
code that produces that error is in one of the ODBC dlls located.

To be more precise the error occurs when I call SQLConnect. And only when the
ODBC-ressource exists, and the function establishes a connection to the
database.
