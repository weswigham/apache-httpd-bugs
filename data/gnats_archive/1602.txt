>Description:
I will configure a virtual host as dev.blah.com and the release host as
www.blah.com.  

No default UserDir directive is in the srm.conf and the UserDir directives are
in the httpd.conf as follows.

<VirtualHost dev.blah.com>
...
UserDir dev_www
...
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.blah.com>
...
UserDir rel_www
...
</VirtualHost>

Under 1.2.4 behaviour is as expected. From dev.blah.com/~username/blah.html
we see the content that we expect to see. From www.blah.com/~username/blah.html
we see the content that we expect to see.  However, under Apache 1.3b3 UserDir
directives within the VirtualHost block appear to be ignored, instead the 
overall "system" UserDir directive is applied and things don't work as expected.
If there is no "system" UserDir directive it defaults to the compiled value of
public_html.  Durned annoying.  
>How-To-Repeat:
I have reverted to Apache 1.2.4 for the time being. However, I would be happy
provide any additional information.

Hmmm, not yet

State-Changed-Why:
It works fine for me.  Are you sure you have read the docs
about the changes in vhosts in 1.3
(see http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/), in specific
the NameVirtualHost if you are using non-IP based
virtual hosts?

I think this is more an issue of the vhosts not being
correcctly configured for 1.3 than anything to do with
the UserDir directive.

 Right, you are.  I reconfigure the server to use the NameVirtualHost
 and entered the IP addresses in and voila it worketh.  Thanks for 
 the response to this. Nothing like reading the manual, eh? 
 
 Question. What were the reasons for overhauling the vhosts section
 in the fashion that it's been done for 1.3?  I'm not entirely clear
 on what this new arrangement buys us.

 Because it greatly helps to disambiguate situations where it is not clear
 to people what is treated as an IP based vhost and what is a name based
 vhost.  We have had many, many problems from situations which aren't
 obvious where people are using one type when they think they are using
 another.
