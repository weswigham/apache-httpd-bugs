Doesn't matter
>Description:
If you use RLimitCPU and RLimitMem to kill runaway CGI scripts, then you can 
get this error if the limits are too low. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Add this to http.conf and run a CGI script (eg. cgi-bin/printenv):

RLimitCPU 20
RLimitMem 10000
>Fix:
Add this to the FAQ about "Premature end of script headers".

It might be better to write an error to the error log which says that
the script was killed because of RLimits (I don't know if it is possible to
figure out if it failed because of CPU or Memory, but if that was possible,
it should print that, too).
