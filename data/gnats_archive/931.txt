>Description:
The answer to Question 21, "Can I increase FD_SETSIZE on FreeBSD?" is
not correct.   Before version 2.2, you need to add "options FD_SETSIZE xxx" to
your kernel configuration file (where xxx is equal to or larger then the value
you used to compile Apache").  Version 2.2 and later do not require the kernel
configuration option and you can just define a larger FD_SETSIZE when you
compile Apache.

When you say "you can define FD_SETSIZE when you compile,"
do you mean as in "cc -DFD_SETSIZE"?

 -DFD_SETSIZE=xxx.  The comment has some truth, but it isn't entirely
 right.  There are limitations in libraries in 2.2 and later that prevent
 you from just redefining FD_SETSIZE and recompiling.  I will update the
 FAQ with the full story when I get a chance.

State-Changed-Why:
The FAQ has been updated with more details.  While you only
have to recompile the kernel in pre 2.2 kernels, you still
have other issues in 2.2 and later systems.
