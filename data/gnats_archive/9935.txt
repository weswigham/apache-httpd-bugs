State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your report.

Since the coredump was not exactly enlightening, the
preferred backup plan is for you to start strace on the
rotatelogs process after rotatelogs has been started but
before the first request arrives.  Please post the last
30 or so lines of the strace output so we can get an idea
of what sort of processing is being performed by rotatelogs
at the time of the segfault.

Procedure:
start apache
"ps ax | grep rotatelogs" to find the PID of rotatelogs
strace -p PID >rotatelogs.trace 2>&1
issue a request which will cause rotatelogs to bomb
hopefully rotatelogs.trace will have some helpful information

Thanks!
(rotatelogs works for me on RedHat 6.2 -- 2.2 kernel with egcs 2.91)
