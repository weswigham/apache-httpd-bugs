>Environment:
DYNIX/ptx 4.4.6, DYNIX cc:  v4.4.5n1019        (00122)
>Description:
apache 1.3.11 compiles successfully, but will not start. we have used both a working
httpd.conf (from a 1.3.9 build) and the default httpd.conf, as well as
a new one. we get the error: httpd: could not open document config file /opt/app/apache_1.3.11/conf/httpd.conf
as supplied by http_config.c, line 1196. we have checked/changed perms
- including trying to start it as root. the path looks correct, etc, etc.
i have tried to look through the source - but stopped at th e ap_pcfg_openfile
definition.
>How-To-Repeat:
got a NUMA-Q? :) i can mail you the truss output, which shows
everything that happens as httpd tries to run.
>Fix:
no - i'm not sure what is causing the fopen failure.
