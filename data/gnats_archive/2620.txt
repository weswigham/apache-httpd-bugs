>Environment:
Win95/NT VC++ 5.0
>Description:
The %LONG% environment variable specified in the CFG macros in the 'Makefile.nt' makefile do not get passed to NMAKE.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the original makefile as is under Win95 or NT.
>Fix:
I know this bug has already been fixed by adding 'LONG=%LONG%' to the makefile, but I found that this problem actually occurs due to a lack of environment space.  I don't know how much use this will be (your current solution seems quicker and easier), but if you add 'command.com /E:1024 /C' before the NMAKE commands, therefore increasing the amount of memory allocated to the environment, the problem seems to be fixed!

State-Changed-Why:

It is generally recommended to have the following in the
c:\config.sys file on Win95:

shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p

assuming C is the drive letter of the DOS/Win boot drive.
