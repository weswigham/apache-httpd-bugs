win98
>Description:
this is not a bug, just a request. an excellent program for win95/98 is WinGate from Qbik in New Zealand. it runs as a service in win95/98. (e.g. in wintop it appears as a cogwheel rather than as an app.) i don't know how it does this but it is a real advantage. i wondered it this would be possible for apache. otherwise i like apache -- easy to install and setup and appears to work well.
>How-To-Repeat:
n/a
>Fix:
find out how Qbik run WinGate as a win95/98 service

This request has been incorporated into the forthcoming release of Apache.  Thank you for your feedback and interest in the Apache httpd project!  Please be aware that this change does not address the question of a 'taskbar' icon to indicate service status, that is already pending in another PR
