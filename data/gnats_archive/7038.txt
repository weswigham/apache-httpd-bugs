 Dear Friends 
 
 We have another believer Tamara Sturtz-Filby!
 
 
 Breathe, in Britney
 
 Suffering form the post-Christmas blue? Oxygen will perk you up says
 Tamara Sturtz-Filby.
 
 What I need is magic cure, the thinking goes to make me feel as if I’ve
 hiked up a mountain – all flushed cheeks and glowing skin- without the
 effort.
 
 Well apparently, oxygen is the thing, and if it’s good enough for Britney,
 Uma, Posh and the Becks, Then it’s good enough for me. Pollution, Tube
 travel, air conditioining, smoking and flying all deplete our oxygen
 levels; even processed sugar, white flour, alcohol and coffee are
 culprits. The air we breathe is only about 21% oxygen – that’s bad news;
 low levels of oxygen make us feel tired, ill and even fat. Increase theses
 levels and we can improve our short term memory, metabolism, immune and
 nervous systems, as well as boost our energy levels no end.
 
 Where do you get the stuff?
 
 Well there’s the O-PUR Oxygen Canister for a fix any time from
 Oxygen.Accessweb.co.uk
