apache
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 using precompiled Apache 1.3.4 from sunfreeware.com
>Description:
In my httpd.conf file, I've specified the following:

TransferLog "|/usr/local/apache/sbin/rotatelogs /usr/local/apache/logs/access_log 86400"
TransferLog "|/usr/local/apache/sbin/rotatelogs /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log 86400"

The error_log file and the access_log file are both unique (and correct)
After rotatelogs executes, I have two daily logs (access_log.XXX and error_log.XXX)
which both contain the same data -- the days access_log.  The data from error_log
seems to be overwritten as httpd creates a new error_log file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Every Day with the above httpd.conf config.
