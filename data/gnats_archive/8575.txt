>Environment:
Solaris 7 (106541-12) 32 bit, Sun Workshop 5.0 compiler, UltraSPARC 1
>Description:
When upgrading from 1.3.19 to 1.3.22 (with mod_ssl) with htdocsdir specified
in a layout-file (--with-layout=config.DPI:DPI) but manualdir not specified,
manualdir was left empty in the Makefile, so that by "make install" the root
was overwritten and all directories and files made readable for group and
others. Instead, manualdir should be set to $htdocsdir/manual by default.
