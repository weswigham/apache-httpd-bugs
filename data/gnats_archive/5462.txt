>Description:
I tried to use content negotiation for offering both WML (WAP) and HTML pages
at the same URL. I offer 3 versions: english HTML, german HTML and english WML.

If a request has the "Accept-Language: en" header, the Apache server always
returns the WML page, also if a header "Accept: text/html" exists in the
request. (Tested with mconnect -p 80 and wget --header="...".)

And in the answer Apache says, as it should: 
Vary: accept,accept-language,accept-charset

If I add the qs parameter to the content-type entry in the type-map, everything
works fine and the server returns the content-type that was requested. (Any
other changes like level=xy hadn't any effect on this behavior.)

But in the Apache documentation the qs parameter everywhere is marked as 
optional, not as necessary, so this is either a software bug (this is what I 
guess, because the Accept header should be paid attention, regardless of the
amount of information in the type-map) or a documentation bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
My type-map has the following content:
---8<---
URI: /ENG/index.html
Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1; level=3
Content-language: en

URI: /WAP/index.wml
Content-type: text/vnd.wap.wml;
Content-language: en

URI: /DEU/index.html
Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1; level=3
Content-language: de
--->8---
If your preferred language is "en", you'll get a WML page, if it's "de" you'll
get a German HTML page.
