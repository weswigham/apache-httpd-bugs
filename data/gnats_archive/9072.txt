>Description:
Trying to get http://localhost to work.  I have done everthing i think possible. 
When I try and tun /etc/init.d/httpd start it says 
bash: /etc/init.d/httpd: No such file or directory
The file is there however, and has the 755 permissions.
Also, when I type in http://localhost the following error occurs :
netscape is unable to locate the sever keyword.netscape.com
