I am using Windows 98
>Description:
This report is similar to 5833.
However, I 've tried all suggestions provided there - from Starting the
program at the DOS prompt(I received message "The program cannot run from 
the DOS ) to reinstalling Apache including configuring and updating
directives.
I checked  and updated next entries in configuration files
HTTP.CONF
ServerType standalone
Port 80
ServerAdmin ATGoldmanD@aol.com(my email address)
ServerRoot "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache
ServerName 127.0.0.1
SRM.CONF file
DocumentRoot "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/htdocs"
ACCESS.CONF
<Directory "C:/Apache/htdocs">

I don't have any log errors generated.My log directory is empty.
When I am trying to start Apache from Windows console, the DOS window
flashes for a second and disappear without any indication of server running

I received from somebody the suggestion to uninstall all previously used web  web servers because they might use the same port
I deleted manually PWS,FrontPage and all its entries in registry 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I don't. I've tried already everything.

I think it is a bug

Comment-Added:

Please inquire of this newsgroup

comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows

since you appear to need running Apache from a command
window.  Apache 1.3.13 will include some helpful changes
that will make using apache from the Start menu icons
more useful.
