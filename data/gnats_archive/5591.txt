>Description:
  If jserv-status is configured at a non-default location then the header graphic breaks. The pages are still useful, they just do not appear to be as attractive/professional as they could.

  For example if jserv-status is configured as follows:

<Location /server/jserv>
    SetHandler jserv-status
</Location>

  The header graphic SHOULD be loaded using the URL '/server/jserv/status?image' or 'status?image'. Instead, the pages generated attempt to load the header graphic using '/jserv/status?image'. This leads to a broken link.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure jserv-status at an unusual location, and view the page.
>Fix:
Change the URL's generated to display the header graphics. Can probably just strip out the leading /jserv/.
