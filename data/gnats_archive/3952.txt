The line stating:
This document attempts to explain exactly what Apache does when deciding what
virtual host to serve a hit from. With the help of the new NameVirtualHost directive virtual host configuration should be a lot easier and safer
than with versions prior to 1.3.

virtual host to serve a hit from. With the help of the new NameVirtualHost directive virtual host configuration should be safer
but much more difficult to configure than with versions prior to 1.3. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Watch your bug tracks.
>Fix:
Allow old VirtualHost declarations to be used with Apache 1.3.

P.S. : Thanks for the powerful web server. I really do appreciate high quality
software like Apache being made available to the general public. Kudos to all
those who invested so much time into making it a reality.
