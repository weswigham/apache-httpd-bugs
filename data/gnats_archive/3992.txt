>Environment:
AIX 4.3.2, IBM C for AIX 4.3 
>Description:
After successful make and 'make install' run: 

/sw/apache134/bin/apachectl start

and you will get:

  Syntax error on line 290 of /sw/apache134/conf/httpd.conf:
  Expected </Directory> but saw </Directory>
  /sw/apache134/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

>How-To-Repeat:
See problem description:
>Fix:
I have found that this is caused by the following statement in line
1145 in /src/main/http_core.c.

   ...  
   if (cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token) { 
   ...

I have replaced this line with the following and it works.
   ...
   if ( strcmp(cmd->cmd->name, cmd->end_token) ) {
   ...

State-Changed-Why:

The current code is correct; it is the AIX C compiler
that is generating bad code.  This has been reported
numerous times and is in the FAQ; see URL
<http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#aixccbug>.
