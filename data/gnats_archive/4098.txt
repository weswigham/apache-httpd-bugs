Solaris 2.5-2.7
>Description:
For one directory I have set:
Options +Indexes
Indexoptions +FancyIndexing

This works however some longer filenames are cut. So I changed:

IndexOptions +FancyIndexing NameWidth=*

Now the fields "last modified", "size" and "description" disappear from
the listing. 

This behaviour is a bit strange but it may conflict with the implemenation
for the FancyIndexing feature.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Maybe some Kind of configurable output format would be nice

IndexFormat "%f %s" ....
where %f is the filename
and   %s is the filesize
(similar to the configurable logfile format)

State-Changed-Why:
You sure it's just not a really really really wide display?
Try the lower scroll bar... the combination you mention works
fine for me.

The configurable display is On The List (it's in the bugdb
a few more times).
