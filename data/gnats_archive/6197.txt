State-Changed-Why:
Are you actually hitting this as a bug?  This code has been
in Apache since the very first release.  It also should not be
hit on Linux machines.  All Linux machines that I know of
have setsid, so your machine should be using setsid not setpgrp.
The only machines that I know of that should hit this code are NEXT,
NEWSOS and UTS21.  I have been unable to find any API docs for
those platforms, and I am hesitant to change the code without them.
