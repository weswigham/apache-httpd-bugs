>Description:
Although following topics just does not affect the product I want let you 
know that:
- In the Apache-JServ-1.0b3/src/c/Makefile clean rule you forgot to remove 
  the jserv_mkimg utility
- In the directory Apache-JServ-1.0b3/src/c there are a few files which 
  have executable permissions they shouldn't have I think:
	jserv.gif jserv_mkimg.c jserv_wrapper_unix.c jserv_wrapper.h
- The Apache-JServ-1.0b3/src/java/Makefile does not provide a rule to 
  generate and install the API documentation

I hope this helps you to make JServ even (a little bit) more better.



Pascal

P.S.:	Congratulations to your web site design. It's one of the best 
	designs I've ever seen!
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
cd Apache-JServ-1.0b3/src/c
chmod 644 jserv.gif jserv_mkimg.c jserv_wrapper_unix.c jserv_wrapper.h

 Fixed in CVS. Scheduled for 1.0b4

 Jon, how to change permissions in the CVS? Can you take care of it?

 What about this one Stefano? You're our Java Makefile Guru!

 CVS doesn't have a concept on permissions of files (at least i'm not using
 that "feature" because it is alpha quality), this permissions stuff needs to
 be done by the make dist script.
 
 eitherway, i really don't think it really matters _that_ much what the
 permissions of the files are.
