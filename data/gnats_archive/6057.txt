apache
>Environment:
FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE, i386 - doesn't matter, anyway...
>Description:
According to ISO 639, the correct country code for Czech (language) is cs. Apache comes with the index file index.html.cz - which does not work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Take any browser, select Czech as the only prefered language, try to access http://localhost/
>Fix:
Just rename the file - make index.html.cs part of the official distribution.
