>Release:        1.2 and 1.1
>Environment:
I am running Apache 1.1.1 and Apache 1.2 on AIX 4.1.4.  I am using the 
commercial C compiler from IBM (xlc).
>Description:
After compiling in the mod_auth_dbm module and setting up dbm files for user 
ids, passwords, and groups,I was unable to get dbm authentication working.  
When I accessed a password protected page, I got a username/password prompt.
After filling in the username and password with valid values, mod_auth_dbm
refused authentication.  I debugged the code and found a couple of problems.  
The contents of some variables were not what was expected.  I have included 
the changes I made to get the module to work below.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I modified the code as follows to force it to work:
 
In the function dbm_check_auth, I made the folloing changes:

  I replaced this line:

     if(!strcmp(w,"group") && sec->auth_dbmgrpfile) {

  with this one:

     if(sec->auth_dbmgrpfile) {

  I deleted the following two lines, and the associated end bracket ("}"):

           while(t[0]) {
               w = getword(r->pool, &t, ' ');

State-Changed-Why:
Are you trying to use both group and user authorization
for the same directory?  

Did you try setting AuthDBMAuthoritative to off?  If
you don't, and you are trying to use both groups and
users in the same directory, when the first is refused
it will refuse the whole request, as documented.

The suggested changes do not do the right thing in most 
cases.
