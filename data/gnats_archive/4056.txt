I use apache in Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, etc. environments
>Description:
HP-UX,
	the file, /sbin/init.d/apacectl, and the links (hard or soft) such as
	/sbin/rc1.d/K99apachectl and /sbin/rc3.d/S99apachectl
	must accept the "start_msg" and "stop_msg" options to work with HP
Linux	
	For RedHat, /sbin/rc.d/init.d/apacectl, needs two lines, they are comments
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes,
Just run on Linux/HP

I modifed the file apachectl fix the above, a copy is in the next panel
As I use apache, and love it, and as I have about 500,000 lines of shell
written to date, I wanted to contribute and feel I have sufficient UNIX
and shell exp. to do so.
