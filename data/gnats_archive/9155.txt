State-Changed-Why:

While Apache 1.3 could often implement the underlying 
locale-specific code page of the Windows workstation, the
results were certainly anything but predictable.  Notably,
if you attempt to use utf-8 URI's, the results were likely
wrong.

Apache 2.0 already uses UTF-8 for the mapping of the client
request to the Unicode filesystem on all Windows NT (2k,XP)
so any filename can be represented.

Give the Apache 2.0.28 beta a try, and please let us know
your reaction to the utf-8 support!
