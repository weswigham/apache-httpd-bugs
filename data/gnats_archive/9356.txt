State-Changed-Why:
This is a problem with your compiler installation, not with Apache.  It appears that gcc is generating opcodes which aren't understood by the Sun assembler.  Perhaps you're supposed to use GNU assembler with gcc?  I dunno. You need to pursue this issue with gcc folks.

Thanks for using Apache!
