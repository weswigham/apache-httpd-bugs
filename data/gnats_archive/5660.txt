Free BSD 3.3_19991130 OS
Compiled Apache using the built in 'ports' Makefile
>Description:
I am using the htpasswd program with the -c switch.
I keep getting an Authentication Failure when trying to login to a page
that is protected by .htaccess / .htpasswd.
The Apache error logs indicate a password mismatch error:

user Jason: authentication failure for "/home/": password mismatch

The strange thing is that this .htpasswd file works fine on my old BSDi 2.0 
machine - with an old 1.2.x version of Apache.

I have checked newsgroups and searched this entire site but havn't found any
answers.

Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
Different operating systems often use different algorithms
for their crypt() routine.  This means that .htpasswd files
are commonly not transportable.

If you add the '-m' flag to your htpasswd command, the
passwords will be encrypted using a common MD5 algorithm
that is built into Apache.  Passwords that are encrypted
this way will work on any system, and the files are
portable.
