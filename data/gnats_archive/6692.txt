Operating System - Sun OS, Web Logic 4.5, Xalan
>Description:
We are using Xalan for transforming a xml source by applying an XSL to make an html output. We need  to define lot of variables for some calculations. When the number of declaration of variables reaches a certain number, we are getting a variable error which is something like
----------------------
XSL Error: pattern = 'boolean(@ref=$VdriverNo)'
Could not get variable named VdriverNo
XSL Error: SAX Exception
pattern = 'boolean(@ref=$VdriverNo)'
Could not get variable named VdriverNo
------------------------

This is a peculiar problem since , say if we declare 2 extra variables it is working but if we declare 3 or more extra variables this error comes.
