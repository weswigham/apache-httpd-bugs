>Description:
After a while, more and more children hung and do not respond to *any* signal.
Neither gdb nor truss can load such processes. (for example, gdb doesn't proceed
further than the message like :
"Attaching to program `/usr/local/bin/httpd', process 7513"

Adding some additional logging to src/main/http_main.c revealed that they hung 
in one of 2 places: during  csd = accept(sd, &sa_client, &clen) (in child_main())
or (less often) during setsockopt() in disable_nagle(). 

The compilation was standard (with --enable-module=auth_dbm) I tried also 
to define WORKAROUND_SOLARIS_BUG but it didn't help.

The server doesn't mount anything via NFS.

The server is quite busy, and there are 9 virtual hosts. 
KeepAlive On
MaxKeepAliveRequests 30
KeepAliveTimeout 15

Apparently the problem appeared after upgrading to Solaris 2.6.
>How-To-Repeat:
It is not reproducible (doesn't depend on URL, client, or server load) but invariably
starts to happen in 2-10 hours after restart.

State-Changed-Why:
Do you have the latest Solaris patch cluster applied?

Are you compiling Apache under 2.6 with a 2.6 compiler (ie.
as opposed to using a 2.5.1 binary, etc.)?

 Hi,
 
 I'm afraid my message didn't get through, so I'm resending it.

 Yes (I included the list of patches in the bug report)

 I'm compiling it under 2.6 with gcc-2.8.1.
