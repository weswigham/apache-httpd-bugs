>Description:
According to Sun, this is what InputStream.available() should do:

Determines the number of bytes that can be read from this input stream without blocking. The available method of InputStream returns 0. This method should be overridden by subclasses. 

JServInputStream.available() does not obey this rule.  It returns the difference between the CONTENT-LENGTH HTTP header and the amount of data that has already been read.  If the socket connection is dropped .available() will say that data is available for a non-blocking read when it is not.  This is VERY BAD because servlet threads will hang forever on reads.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:

This bug is EXTREMELY easy to fix.  It turns out that the SocketInputStream in that is a member of JServInputStream correctly implements the available() method.  

All JServInputStream should do is:
   
   return in.available()
