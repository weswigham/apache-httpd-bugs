>Organization:
>Environment:
Redhat Linux 4.2 with GCC
>Description:
We are using SSI to execute cgi script in our pages. And we've found that 
when the page is viewed by IE 4.0, there seems to be at lease 10 or even 
more processes created (view via ps command). And when we continuously 
click the reload button, after around 10 reload, it will go over the 256
processes, and the cgi script will report error. It will need to wait for
the process to be dropped back before the cgi script can successfully run
again. At the time of dropping back, the locked process will increase 
greatly for a while. There is no such problem when I view it via Netscape 
4.05, or viewing other pages that do not contain ssi.  
>How-To-Repeat:
As that's in part of our private site, if you need to check it, please send
me email so we can arrange for your testing.
>Fix:
No, and we are in need of any quick fix. 

Thanks.

[Response from user, who did *not* Cc apbugs]

No one seems replied, and seems that the problem is still there. Anyone
have any advice?

State-Changed-Why:

1. How many SSI directives are there in the original page?
2. Are they all "include virtual" directives?
3. How many different scripts are involved?
4. Does this behaviour still occur with 1.3.4?
5. Does the behaviour change if you disallow keepalive
   connexions from IE4 clients?
