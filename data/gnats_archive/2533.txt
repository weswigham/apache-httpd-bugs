SCO OpenServer 5.0.4 using gcc 2.7.2.3 and GNU make 3.76.1
>Description:
Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support for the SCO OpenServer platform
is missing. When given the --enable-shared=max the configure
script tries to guess what shared flags to use by how Perl was
built but gets it wrong as Perl was built with cc not gcc.
Anyway, it shouldn't have to guess.

I found i also needed to add some function prototype declarations
to satisfy the compiler. None of the changes should impact builds
on other platforms.

If the copy/paste of the patch below got fudged, send e-mail to rr@sco.com
and i will e-mail you the patches.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to configure and build Apache 1.3.0 on OpenServer 5 using
./configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max
make
>Fix:
Apply the following with "patch -p 1 -c ..." :

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your patch. A few notes:

1. The common_init problem is now already fixed
   by having the SecureWare stuff in REALMAIN.
   But nevertheless thanks for the hint.

2. The DSO related patches are fine and are now
   already comitted by me for Apache 1.3.1

3. The FCNTL-related change I cannot review because
   I don't have a SCO box available. Are you
   really sure SCO5 doesn't need USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT?

4. The DBM stuff is IMHO too much. Just a 
   DBM_LIB="-lndbm" should be enough and working fine.
   Can you please remove the find-dbm-lib patch
   for you and try again without it and give feedback
   if it still works? Thanks.

5. I'm confused by three new libs -ltinfo -lx -lm.
   Ok, libm is no problem, but what are libx and libtinfo?
   libtinfo = terminfo library? Ops, for Apache?
   Please give us more hints why these are actually 
   needed. Thanks.

Subject: Re: os-sco/2533: Apache 1.3.0 won't build with Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support
Date: Wed, 08 Jul 1998 13:51:59 -0700

 Thanks for accepting the patches necessary to get Apache to
 build with DSO support on SCO OpenServer. I'll try to explain
 the need for additional patches.
 
 First, a kernel bug in OpenServer 5.0.0 and 5.0.2 made it
 necessary to build Apache with USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
 That bug was fixed in 5.0.4 and a patch made available for
 5.0.0/5.0.2 systems. Further, i have created an installation
 script which detects what release you are installing on and
 whether you need to apply the "Network Maintenance Supplement".
 Therefore, i can now build Apache without the
 USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT which gets me much better performance.
 So, as long as you get Apache for OpenServer from _me_ (that is,
 the SCO Skunkware CD-ROM or web site), you're ok. If you build
 it yourself, you'd better know whether you need to apply the
 appropriate support supplement.
 
 Second, you were right, i was able to remove the find-dbm-lib
 patch and successfully build Apache 1.3.0. Forget that patch.
 
 Third, i still find the addition of "-lx -ltinfo -lm" to be
 necessary on OpenServer. It's no doubt a bug or at least
 incorrectly documented, but any time -lprot is used you also
 need -lx and -ltinfo to get nap(), cur_term(), setup_term()
 and others. I've informed our development system guys and
 this may be fixed in a later release but for now these libs
 are necessary. FYI, libx is the SCO Xenix enhancements which
 have been carried forward since time immemorial while libtinfo
 is the terminfo library. It looks like libprot is supposed to
 setup its own curses stuff but isn't built correctly.
 
 To summarize, i believe the patches i submitted for src/Configure
 and src/include/conf.h are appropriate.
 
 Let me know if you need further details,

Comment-Added:
Ok, the `-lx -ltinfo -lm' was now comitted for Apache
1.3.2, but for the USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT: 
The only correct solution would be to dispatch
for 5.0.0 and 5.0.2 and avoid it only for >= 5.0.4.
So what we need is a patch which does the following:
1. Recognize SCO versions in src/helpers/GuessOS
2. Set the SCO5 define not only to be defined, instead
   it should be set to 500, 502 or 504, etc. according
   to what GuessOS determined.
3. The #define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT should
   be surrounded by a
   #if defined(SCO5) && (SCO5 >= 500 && SCO5 < 504)
Can you contribute this patch, because I've still
no chance to work under a SCO box myself. I've
no such platform available...

 Below are patches i've made to Apache 1.3.1 in order to detect which release
 of SCO OpenServer 5 you are on and whether the appropriate supplements have
 been installed. Install with "patch -p 0 -i /path/to/patchfile".
 
 These patches (src/helpers/GuessOS, src/include/ap_config.h, and
 src/Configure) obviate the need for the #define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 when building on OpenServer 5.0.4 or later, or when building on 5.0.0/5.0.2
 with the appropriate supplements installed. If the supplements aren't installed,
 we use #define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT and tell the user where to download
 the freely available supplements.
 
 I realize these patches are non-trivial and may take some time to grok.
 However, i believe they do not effect the configure/build of any other
 platform and i have tested them successfully. When i build Apache for use
 on OpenServer, i use something similar in the installation scripts to detect
 the release and supplement state of the target platform prior to installing.
 These installation scripts are still necessary as Apache built on one system
 may be installed on another (unsuitable) system. Do you want my installation
 scripts (useful only when packaging for an SCO Custom install on OpenServer).
 
 If you have any questions of further requests, please feel free to contact me.

 p.s. did you get the free OpenServer & UnixWare i requested for you ?
