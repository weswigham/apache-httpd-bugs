State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Mon Jun 18 09:41:10 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
path_info has no meaning to a handler by default.  path_info is based entirely on filesystem paths, while modules can serve content from virtual spaces that have nothing to do with the filesystem.
