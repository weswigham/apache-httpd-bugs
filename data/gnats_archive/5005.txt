RedHat linux 6, egcs-2.91.66
>Description:
Currently, mod_proxy ignores all headers set by other modules.
For example if you are using mod_usertrack and mod_proxy
at the same time, cookies set by mod_usertrack
will be lost when request get to mod_proxy.
>How-To-Repeat:
here is part of CFG file:

# --- Proxy setup ---

ProxyRequests off
ProxyPass        / http://deimos.us.matranet.com/
ProxyPassReverse / http://deimos.us.matranet.com/
ProxyDomain      .us.matranet.com


# --- User tracking ----

CookieTracking on
CookieExpires "60 seconds"
CookieName    ApacheTracker
CustomLog     logs/clickstream "%{cookie}n %r %t"

Notice that cookies not set.
>Fix:
I've put patch correcting this problem at:

ftp://ftp.crocodile.org/pub/apache-patches/proxy.headers.patch

I've tested and it works fine.
Also it hadles err_headers_out and FTP proxying as well.
