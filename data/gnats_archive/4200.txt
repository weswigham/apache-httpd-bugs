>Description:
configure doesn't recognise "--help", "-help", or "-h", though the script
looks like it should, plus "./configure" with no args suggests you should
"at least run './configure --help' for a compact summary of available options."

--help just seems to hang; -h and -help seem to be ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --help
>Fix:
Not as such I'm afraid.  But the configure script sets a variable "help"
to "yes" if any of these options is set, but never checks it - perhaps that's
the problem?

 Hmm, looks like a spoke a little too soon - the options *do* work, but
 there's a very long pause before the help message is output - nearly 2
 minutes on a reasonably fast Solaris box under moderate load.
 
 I think this still deserves attention - others are likely to suspect the
 script has just hung, as I did.

State-Changed-Why:
Yeah that confuses me too.  I added a little warning.  The
script has to generate some of the help at run time by scanning
various directories and such... which is what takes so long.
