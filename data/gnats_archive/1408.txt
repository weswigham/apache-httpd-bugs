State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly a configuration error.  You need
to reread the docs, check the error log to be sure the
server is being started, and verify what port you are 
running it on.  We can't really help 600000 users with basic
installation issues; you may get a better response asking
on the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix newsgroup.
