>Environment:
HP-UX 10.10 on an HP 9000/735  System compiler (though same on gcc 2.7.1)
>Description:
I have configured a single directory inside the document tree as a link to a direcory
outside the doc tree.  Have searched completely for .htaccess files (none found on
entire system).  Receive error in browser that access not allow and get the 
"Symbolic Link not permitted" message in error log.

I am able to view the link outside of the browser (from command line...)

Even fired server off running as root...no change.
>How-To-Repeat:
Site is inside a firewall.... sorry.
>Fix:
My only option right now is to place the files physically inside the doc tree. 
I don't really want to do that if I have a choice..

State-Changed-Why:
I can't reproduce this problem.  Can you double check all the
Options settings in your files?  That includes httpd.conf, access.conf
and srm.conf.  If you're still having problems then please mail
your config files.

Thanks

 Thanks for the reply.  I am out of the office this week for training,
 but will try to do a minimal clean install.  I have been through the
 files pretty thoroughly and am beginning to wonder if the problem is
 related to HP-UX 10.10, as a similar issue has been kicked out the perl
 5 porters regarding that particular O/S version...
 
 Will followup if I find any changes,

Closing this up assuming that it's an OS problem rather than
an Apache problem.  I don't recall getting any other email about
the problem.
