>Description:
While setting up virtual host support on my web server I experienced some bizarre behavior.  I may hav simply overlooked a directive or something.  Anyway lets say I am on www.realdomain.com and I serve many virtual hosts using IP-based virtual hosting.  The machine www.realdomain.com is a multi-user platform with the user realuser1.  When I access http://www.realdomain.com/ I receive the normal document root index.html.  When I view http://www.realdomain.com/~realuser1 I am able to view that users index.html in their home directory.  When I access http://www.virtualdomain.com/ I receive the proper document as specified from the Document root within the <VirtualHost>.  However if I do http://www.virtualdomain.com/~realuser1 I receive that users web page again.  This behavior is less than desirable it seems.  Is there a way to prevent this?

I've searched the documentation regarding all the directives and virtual host setup in detail and have not been able to fix this problem.  I'm assuming its a simple configuration problem, since I have seen this behavior on other systems similar to my setup.

Thank you

State-Changed-Why:
I don't see anything bizarre about this.  Main server
directives are inherited by virtual hosts.  You have
something like "UserDir public_html" in your config,
so that is used.

You can either make your main server a virtual server
(and use something like ServerName localhost in now-unused
"main" Apache server) or you can add something like
"UserDir disabled" to each virtual host.
