>Description:
I cannot get a CGI script (Perl script) to execute with Windows 95 and Apache 1.3.1.
I have looked at all the bug reports, checked all the docuementation, checked my config files, 
and I still don't know what I'm doing wrong.

Here is my error
Error Message

Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, you@your.address and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you
might have done that may have caused the error.

Here are snippets from my config files.

# To use CGI scripts:
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

State-Changed-When: Sun Sep 20 15:21:33 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
First, be aware that interpreted CGIs have to have a
#! line as the first line specifying the name of the
interpreter.

Second, in 1.3.1 there is a bug related to directories
with spaces in the name.  This is fixed in 1.3.2, which
should be available this week.

 Marc,
     Thanks for the quick response. I do have the "#! " in the first line of the
 cgi script, as required. However, I _do_ have spaces in the directories pointing
 to the cgi script.   Thanks so much for the tip; I look forward to getting the new
 1.3.2....
 
     Thanks again for responding so quickly!
