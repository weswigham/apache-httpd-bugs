>Description:
This is similar to 3866.
When I am either connected to a LAN or connected to my ISP. mod_jserv has no
problems connecting to the JServ servlet. But when I am doing development while
not connected to a network I get the following error in mod_jserv.log:

(EMERGENCY) apj11: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007
(EMERGENCY) ajp11: connection fail
(ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "ajpv11"
(ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "status"

I have set all of the hostnames to 127.0.0.1 in the config files

I wonder if it can't figure out my host name or something of that sort.  When I am connected
to a net work, the host name is being given to the computer.

This is similar behaviour to item 3866.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Apache and ApacheJserv on a laptop that is not connected to a network. (Using one
that is sometimes connected to a network may more closely match my situation)

type in the URL http://127.0.0.1:<your_port_number>/jserv/

then click on one of the mapped servlet engines

>Fix:
I haven't a clue (maybe I am not setting something up right)

 Can you tell me what Operating System are you using? I'd bet you're
 trying JServ on a WINDOWS (95/98/NT) machine...

 Please do the following test WHILE NOT CONNECTED TO ANY NETWORK (PCMCIA
 or DIALUP):
 Enter the MS-DOS prompt, then:
 C:\> ping 127.0.0.1
 
 You should get one of those two responses:
 "Request timed out." or
 "Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128"
 
 Which one you get????

 Do this other test... While not connected to the network, try to telnet
 to your JServ port (like telnet localhost 8008), and tell me what
 happens (does it connects or not?) and also repeat the same test w/ your
 PCMCIA card inserted....

 It seems that the bug resides in localhost binding from the JVM...
 I don't know how it works under windows, but it seems that when you're
 not connected to the network, the localhost interface is "somehow"
 disabled... (MicroSoft Mysteries)...
 
 Just check if you have a card in Windows95 called "localhost" or
 "looback" something (under Windows NT there is), if it's there, just
 install it and choose the 127.0.0.1 address for it w/ a netmask of
 255.0.0.0...
 It should solve the problem...
 
 Please, also, can you tell me if, while doing those tests, the PCMCIA
 card was in the slot or not (you removed it, or just disconnected the
 network cable?)
