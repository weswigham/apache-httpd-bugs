OS: Solaris2.6 CC: gcc2.8.0 MAKE: /usr/ccs/bin/make
>Description:
both are not REAL bugs (and perhaps reported long times ago), but ...
1. making with mod_perl fails because the script 'apaci' is located in 
   apache_1.XX/src, but make for mod_perl searches in apache1.XX/src/modules.
   ln -s ../apaci . solved the problem, but may be done in configure
   (or is this problem caused by mod_perl ???)
2. starting the server with the precompiled *.conf's wont work with Solaris2.6,
   because the entry "Group #-1" in httpd.conf produces an error like:
   [alert] (22)Invalid argument: setgid: unable to set group id to Group 4294967295
>How-To-Repeat:
-
>Fix:
1. fix searchpath for 'apaci' script in configure ?
2. dont really now, may also be done by configure ?

Comment-Added:
Thanks.  mod_perl *just* added support for apaci last night,
so expect to see it in the next few versions.

The "Group #-1" thing is designed to force you to put a 
real value there :)

Thanks for using Apache.
