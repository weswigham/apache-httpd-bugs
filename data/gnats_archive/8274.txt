 Hello Serious Investors,
 
 The downward spiral continued on Thursday burying the Dow Jones
 below the key 10K level and forcing many other major market
 averages to post new relative lows. News from overseas was
 mostly responsible for today’s plunge in addition to the dull
 earnings outlook that investors heard from Sun Microsystems
 (SUNW) yesterday 
 
 Earlier on Thursday, the European Central Bank cut interest
 rates by 25 basis points to 4.25%, delivering its second easing
 this year in response to increasingly weakening growth and
 slowing inflation. The cut was not unexpected as the ECB has
 been under heavy pressure to ease for quite a while. However,
 some had hoped that the ECB would be more aggressive in today’s
 decision and would cut by a half a point. The U.S. federal
 funds rate stands at 3.5%, and Europe is clearly behind the
 curve by majority opinion. 
 
 But what really distressed the equity markets today was the
 ECB’s apparent bias against further easing. The European Bank
 has been much more stubborn than the Fed or even the Bank of
 England in bringing down rates despite the fast deterioration
 of the European economy. Today’s move was only the third rate
 cut by the stingy ECB since it took control over rates in the
 single currency zone in January 1999. 
 
 And more gloomy news from Europe followed. The number one
 software giant got hurt on the day as investors realized
 Microsoft is now having ‘problems with the law’ over in Europe.
 European Union regulators have opened additional proceedings
 against the company today. European Union thinks that Microsoft
 could be in violation of antitrust laws by tying its Media
 Player product into its Windows operating system in attempt to
 extend its dominance from personal computers into other
 markets. Despite many brokerage firms trying to defend
 Microsoft, the stock was sold off sharply losing 5.5% on the
 day. 
 
 
 +>+>+>  GOOD NEWS... Notice that the Volatility index (VIX.X)
 is now over 28 and made another advance of 9% in today’s
 session.  Market bottoms are often made when this index spikes
 over 40 for a number of days, so this index is moving in the
 right direction at this time.
