>Description:
mod_proxy drops the query ("?option=value...") part of a request under the following conditions:

Setup:

A user agent (Netscape 4.61 for linux) is directly (no proxy in between) accessing a Apache (http://apache.some.domain/) with mod_proxy enabled and configured as a reverse proxy for https://host.some.domain/. (configs see below)
Access from Apache to host.some.domain is handled via http://proxy.some.domain:8080/

User agent
--> sends request to get http://apache.some.domain/cgi-bin/whatever?option=value
to 172.20.64.74 Apache installation (linux, as stated above)
--> sends request to get https://host.some.domain/cgi-bin/whatever and drops (!) the "?option=value" part completely
to proxy.some.domain:8080 (Netscape Proxy Server) via http
--> sends malformed request "https://host.some.domain/cgi-bin/whatever"
to host.some.domain:443
where the malformed request triggers a server error (500) because no values have been submitted

The problem seems to depend on at least one condition, namely that the request is done via https, not http. No dropping of the query part occurs when accessing any server via http (via proxy).
The patch delivered eliminates this problem (in my setup, at least).

Configuration data on the Apache machine (relevant lines):
ProxyPass / https://daska.union-investment.de/
ProxyPassReverse / https://daska.union-investment.de/
ProxyRemote * http://192.0.2.30:8080
NoCache *

a quick patch for src/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c:

This patch seems to work great, but since I'm not an expert for the things happening within Apache, I do not know for sure whether this is the right place to fix the problem or not.
