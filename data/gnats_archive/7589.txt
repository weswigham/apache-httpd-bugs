State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Thu Apr 19 04:41:54 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The Acrobat plug-in uses byte range requests to retrieve
sections of a PDF file from the web server.  Unfortunately,
this function was broken in the version of Apache you are 
using -- 1.3.14.

Please upgrade to the current stable version (1.3.19).

Thanks for using Apache!
