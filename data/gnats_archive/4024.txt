>Description:
I have verified that the jserv.conf file exists that the specified location

Also when I run the file 'apachectl start', 
I get errors saying that I must specify a secret key....well, 
I have done that and it still gives me the errors.

>How-To-Repeat:
please help me in getting the JServ running, the apache 1.3.4 runs fine.  
I compiled them together with no problem, should I get a page up at 127.0.0.1/jserv/
saying that all is well when the JServ is running right?  the online docs say so.
I am very interested in getting this running so that I can start my java development
>Fix:
tell me what needs to be done at this point to solve the problem.  I am experienced in 
java, but somewhat limited in my web server capabilities.  I apologize for that 
and hope that I can get this fixed.
