>Description:
I'm using the mod_proxy module to proxy to another server that sets multiple cookies and it appears that the proxy server is dumping all but the last cookie.  My suspicion is that this is due to the fact that multiple cookies each get their own line in the set of HTTP Response headers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Have a server proxy to another server that can serve up CGI scripts.

Then execute this script via CGI

----- begin script here ------
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5 -w

sub printPage {
  print <<EOF;
Set-Cookie: cookie1=cookie1; domain=.lehman.com; path=/; expires=Mon, 06-Feb-2012 15:32:33 GMT\r
Set-Cookie: cookie2=cookie2; domain=.lehman.com; path=/; expires=Mon, 06-Feb-2012 15:32:33 GMT\r
Foobar: test1\r
Foobar: test2\r
Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2002 15:32:33 GMT\r

}

printPage;
---- end of script -----

When I access the page via a browser, I see the following returned to me:

As you can see, the Foobar headers got combined into one line, but the Set-Cookie headers had some trouble. Only the last Set-Cookie header got returned to me.
