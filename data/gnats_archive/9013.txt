>Description:
Hello.

I'm having problems with Apache 2.0.28.  Since I edited the httpd.conf I've been getting problems with some modules. Here's some info:

#LoadModule gzip_module modules/ApacheModuleGzip.dll

This one.  The server says "Cannot find module in "path""

same for:

#   LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll

When testing httpd.conf  Apache just open window then closes window straight away.  So,I had to goto command prompt and did apache -d httpd.conf

Apache doesn't seem to start properly.  Says Error "The Request operation has failed"

Same for Shutdown or restart.

State-Changed-When: Sun Dec  9 11:12:59 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Both of the modules you mentioned are third-party; that is,
they are not distributed with the base apache.  Therefore,
if you have problems with them, you really need to address
it with the people who are distributing those modules.
There is nothing we can do about software that we don't
control.

Thanks for using Apache.

 Hello,
 
 Thank you for your response.  I know it's 3rd party software.  But, when
 using
 Apache 1.3.22 it works fine.  Loads fine.  No problem.  Now, onto Apache
 2.0.28
 It doesn't work.
 
 I think there was some info about Apache not supporting DLL anymore.
