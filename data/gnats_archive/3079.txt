>Description:
During the run of a cgi script, the web server receives a SIGUSR1 (graceful shutdown and reload). This signal is propogated to all members of the process group, include the cgi process. Not expecting a signal, the cgi process dies. Is this a reasonable thing to expect? SIGUSR1 will almost certainly not have the same semantics for the CGI as it does for the server. 
>How-To-Repeat:
write a quick cgi script that sleeps for 30 seconds, call it, meanwhile send 
SIGUSR1 to the web server daemon.
>Fix:
call setsid inside spawn_child... ?
