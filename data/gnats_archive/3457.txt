>Environment:
Win98, Apa 1.3.3 (win32)
>Description:
Can you please see to it, that the directory listing gets fixed for those entries that result in special HTML notations being insterted in the output text?
For example whenever I use "&" in a name on the disk, it gets translated to "&amp" in the output, but the length of the output is not recalculated to one character instead of four. So the result is a line that is 3 chars shorter than it should be and than all the others are... 
>How-To-Repeat:
Just make a name on the disk with a "&" in it and watch the output of that directory thru mod_autoindex (FancyIndexing on)
>Fix:
