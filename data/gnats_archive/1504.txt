>Description:
I used a simple script that logs all requests to a file to track down this
problem.  When I give a URL encoded query with an equals sign my script 
reports no input.  But as long as the query string doesn't contain an equals
then it reports what I would expect.  I'm _pretty_ sure this is a server bug.
I apologize if I'm mistaken.  I tagged this as 'critical' because I believe 
this to be an important and widely used feature

 Don't use argv.  Read the CGI "spec" http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ ... 
 you'll find a description of this bizarre behaviour.  Tell us if that
 doesn't cover what you're talking about.

 MY GOD.  You're right.  That's about the strangest thing.  Well, my life
 just got complicated :(.
 
 Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.  Keep up the good work.
