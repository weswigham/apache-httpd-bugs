Windows 95 with NN 4.x
>Description:
Html/javascript code runs on the "www", but, same code will not run correctly 
on the Apache //localhost: server.
There is a significant difference in how files are handled on the Apache-Win32
versus the "web".
When writing and testing "HTML" code, "http://" url's will not work. Quite 
interestingly, this affects "HTML" only, as in this example:
"<img src="http://localhost:4444/images/9.gif">" does NOT work !
"<img src="file://D|/Perl56i/images/9.gif">"     does work !

however, when I use javascript, I can use relative URL's, such as:
  image.src = "../images/9.gif"; -or-
  image.src ="http://localhost:4444/images/9.gif"

also, when I write javascript "functions", many will not function correctly 
when the //localhost: is mounted, so I have to test them with the browser in 
"stand-alone mode".
This is not a "Browser" specific problem. I have tested this under several 
versions of Netscape (v4.08, v4.5, v4.75) with the exact same results.
I have no idea why the Apache alters the behavior of the browser.

Thanks for your help,
Steve A. <sarbayo@telis.org>
>How-To-Repeat:
HTML example:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img border="0" src="http://localhost:4444/images/box.jpg" width="100" height="100"></td>
<td><img border="0" src="file:///D|/Perl56i/images/box.jpg" width="100" height="100"></td>
</tr>
<...>
in this instance, only the second image will display, where actually they
should both work.

Javascript example:
<script>
function print_to_msgWindow() {
//this function should print to msgWindow
  msgWindow.document.image.src = "../images/box.jpg";
  msgWindow.document.image.src = "http://localhost:4444/images/box.jpg";
}
</script>
this function does not work on //localhost:, 
but, does on the "www".

State-Changed-Why:

Your question is quite confusing, and is almost surely
not a problem with Apache, but rather some sort of
error in your configuration.  I suggest that you
take your question to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup
or a similar forum that is able to help with
basic configuration issues.  This database is
only for reporting bugs in Apache.
Thanks for using Apache!
