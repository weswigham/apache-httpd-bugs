State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid you have to give more information than that.
What are the contents of the htaccess files?  Does it work
locally?  Can you read it if you su to the user that Apache
runs as on the server?

 It works locally but only under Document root directory
 
 Here is the content of ".htaccess" file :
 
 AuthUserFile /home/dangt/.htpasswd
 AuthGroupFile /dev/null
 AuthName Tuan DANG
 AuthType Basic
 
 <limit GET>
 require valid-user
 </limit>=20
 
 >> Error log of Apache server :
 
 [Thu Feb 26 17:21:54 1998] access to /home/dangt/.htaccess failed for
 fred2640,
 reason: Invalid command ~    <<<<<<<<<<< You may notice this strange
 message.
 
 Thanks

 Erm....
 
 You say the htaccess file contains:
 
 	AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/passwd/.htpasswd
 	AuthGroupFile /dev/null
 	AuthName Tuan_DANG
 	AuthType Basic
 
 	<limit GET>
 	require valid-user
 	</limit>
 	~                  
 
 Well, it seems pretty obvious that ~ is an invalid command and that
 is what the server is reporting...

 No.  If it is invalid, it will not be allowed.  Ignoring invalid things is
 bad.
