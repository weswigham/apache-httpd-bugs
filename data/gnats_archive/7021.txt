>Description:
This configuration worked fine in version 1.3.12, but when I upgraded to 1.3.14, it no longer worked.

>How-To-Repeat:
Put this into your httpd.conf file:

<Directory "C:/">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>   
Alias /c "C:/"

Then try to access the /c alias.

State-Changed-Why:

You are correct.  The directive previously succeded due
to a parsing error in 1.3.12 which has been corrected
for security.

The Alias and ScriptAlias directives -require- trailing
slashes to both be present or ommitted from the alias's
path and the filesystem's path.  Therefore these alias
directives are legal:

Alias /foo/ c:/apache/docs/foo/
Alias /foo c:/apache/docs/foo
Alias /foovol/ f:/

Since rooting to a volume requires a slash-terminated
filesystem spec (f:/), it is impossible to root the share
with a non-slash-terminated alias name.  There is no
workaround, this is consistent with security practice that
volume roots should never be exposed as web directories.

It may be possible for you to work around this issue by
using a redirection in addition to your alias.  You can
equire on news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows

Thanks for the report and your interest in the Apache
httpd server project!
