I will use Apache webserver for Net.Data but if not succesfull, maybee better to
use Lotus Domino.... what's your point about that?
>How-To-Repeat:
1.Cannot find path but configuration is ok.
msg.: can not find file on this server
Simular configuration is running on OS/2 !?@#
2.URL to the installation tool for WINDOWS 95 (or NT)

1.Other conf file(s)

 Yes it is.
 
 I'm not sure how more explicit than labelling it "1.3.1 Win32 binary" we
 can be.

 No.
 
 The source is available in the .tar.gz file, but the only Windows version
 is the installshield installer.

 You didn't mention a DocumentRoot, which tells the server where
 the documents can be found.  Take a look at your error.log to see
 what it says about not being able to find the file.  You'll have
 to stop the server to look at the error log.

 That's obviously up to you.. :-)
