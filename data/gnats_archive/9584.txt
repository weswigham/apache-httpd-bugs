>Release:        1.3.22
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
OS Windows 98 SE, Tomcat 4.0.1, webapp-module 1.0-tc40
>Description:
I´ve added the mod_webapp.so and libapr.dll to the folder /modules in APACHE_HOME. And I´ve modified my httpd.conf adding the following lines:

LoadModule webapp_module modules/mod_webapp.so
AddModule mod_webapp.c
WebAppConnection conn      warp  127.0.0.1:8008
WebAppDeploy     examples     conn  /examples
WebAppDeploy     manager      conn  /manager
WebAppDeploy     tomcat-docs  conn  /docs
WebAppInfo /webapp-info

If I try to acess http://localhost/webapp-info or /examples or /manager or /docs, I get an HTTP 404 Error - File not found. The /server-info page says, mod_webapp.c is installed and configured like I wrote above. Sorry I report this here, but I couldn't find any help. Everything is exactly as described in the install instructions, so it should work, but it doesn't.
>How-To-Repeat:
On a Win98SE machine, install apache, tomcat and the webapp module and see if it works.
>Fix:
no, just use mod_jserv or mod_jk for communication
