>Description:
I have previously filed a bug report saying that Apache refuses arguments
to CGI scripts in the URL containing '%2f'. The reply was that Apache refuses
to accept '%2f' in URL so that CGI scripts may not unknowingly allow something
where a '/' would've called for refusal. 

My point is that Apache always unescapes the arguments before passing them to
a CGI script. So a %2f in the URL would be seen by the CGI as a '/' and it is
free to refuse corresponding access. I think Apache's intent should be to 
refuse a %2f in the UNESCAPED URL. That is, if a %2f is further escaped into
%25%32%66, Apache would unescape it - so it'll become %2f and then it'll be
passed to the cgi script. So Apache shouldn't be rejecting URLs containing a 
%2f - it should be rejecting URLs containing a %25%32%66 sequence. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Try the following with the default Apache 1.3.3 distribution:
http://serverhost/cgi-bin/printenv/a/a/     ->  allowed
http://serverhost/cgi-bin/printenv/a%2fa/    -> disallowed
http://serverhost/cgi-bin/printenv/a%25%32%66a/ -> allowed (look at PATH_INFO)
>Fix:
The fix is to modify function ap_unescape_url() in src/util.c so that it
doesn't reject %2f in the original URL but rather rejects %2f in the 
unescaped URL.

State-Changed-Why:

As mentioned when your previous report was closed,
this issue is being tracked in PR #543.  It is not
considered resolved, but we don't want to have multiple
reports of the same problem when the database is available
to all.  If you wish to provide feedback on the issue,
send a message to <apbugs@apache.org> with a subject of 
'Re: mod_cgi/543: "%2F" not allowed in VGI script PATH_INFO'.
I am closing this report for the same reason.
