>Description:
Using multiple entries for Accept-Language: w/o any weighting results in language other than first being returned, at least in the cases below.
I'm using OmniWeb 4.0.6 through the current beta, also tested manually by entering the headers in a telnet session.  Changing User-Agent to 'Hand' resulted in the same problem.
I saw several PRs in the area of Accept-Language relating to en-us, but didn't see this problem.  Sorry if its a dup.
>How-To-Repeat:
URL = http://httpd.apache.org/docs/

By hand:
telnet httpd.apache.org
GET /docs/ HTTP/1.0
Host: httpd.apache.org
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, image/tiff, multipart/x-mixed-replace,  */*
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1, utf-8, iso-10646-ucs-2, macintosh, windows-1252, *
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en, de, nl, fr, it, es
User-Agent: Hand

French is returned.
Include 'ja' before 'es', and Japanese is returned

Unknown - could be content, config, or server code problem.

 	I think this is not really a bug in apache, I wasn't
 supplying any preference orders for languages (q=<value>).
 It'd be nice if the spec. said to take the order in which
 Accept-Language: values arrive for precedence when no
 q=<value> info is present, but (I think) it doesn't,
 so Apache is doing the right thing.
 	Sorry for a bogus bug report.  I didn't see another
 way to respond to the bug than replying to this email,
 is there something?
 
 		Thanks,

Also take a look at some fixes that made it into the
2.0.32 release.  We did address some Accept-Language
issues within the .31-.32 timeframe.
