State-Changed-When: Sat Feb  3 16:32:04 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Since the 1.3.6 installer is no longer supported, afraid
we can't be of much help.  The current directory contains
much more recent versions that address a ton of bugs.
1.3b1 - 1.3.15 were beta-quality releases, whereas 1.3.17
is the first 'initial release quality' product released.

Please use a more recent version.
