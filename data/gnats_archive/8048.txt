>Description:
More detailed analysis of bug 5811:

Because of the use of strstr() on line 234, a cookie named "BID" could
mistakenly get recognised and used by mod_usertrack as a cookie whose
name is a substring of "BID", such as "ID".
>How-To-Repeat:
1. With mod_usertrack compiled in, set httpd.conf:
<IfModule mod_usertrack.c>
CookieTracking on
CookieName ID
CookieExpires 2147483647
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" \"%{cookie}n\"" cookiecombined
</IfModule>
# CustomLog /usr/local/apache_1.3.20/logs/access_log common
<IfModule !mod_usertrack.c>
CustomLog /usr/local/apache_1.3.20/logs/access_log common
</IfModule>
<IfModule mod_usertrack.c>
CustomLog /usr/local/apache_1.3.20/logs/access_log cookiecombined
</IfModule>

2. Hit your site with Netscape Navigator (or any browser that allows cookie
manipulation) to allow the cookie to be set. tail -f logs/access if you'd like
to watch the cookie get set (it'll be the last entry of each log line)

3. Quit Netscape Navigator.

4. Edit $HOME/.netscape/cookies and change the cookie named "ID" to "BID"

5. Restart Netscape Navigator and hit your site, watching a "tail -f logs/access"
You will see that the cookie named "BID" is getting logged, because it is
being recognised as the cookie "ID". What *should* happen is a new cookie
named "ID" should get set on your browser, as BID should not be recognised.
>Fix:
Correctly parse the cookies into an Apache table, favouring ap_getword()
over strstr() and retrieve the cookie you are interested in from the table.

Here is a patch:
