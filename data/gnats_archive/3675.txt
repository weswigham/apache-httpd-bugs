NT4sp3,MSVC5sp2,JDK1.2,JSDK2.0, Apache JServ1.0b2
>Description:
I've written a servlet that accesses native code using JNI.  
This appears to works for a while and then fail.

From the logs it appears that the JVM in which the servlet
ran initially has been closed but subsequent attempts to
access the servlet fail because the library "has been loaded
by another JVM".
