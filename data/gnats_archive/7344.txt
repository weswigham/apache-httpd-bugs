>Environment:
Windows 98, 4.10.1998
>Description:
When I try to install apache_1.3.17-win32-no_src.msi and specify installation directory not a "C:\Program Files\Apache Group" by pressing "Change..." button,  MSI installer says "The volume C: is currently unavailable. Please select another", then finishes installation procedure without any copying etc.

If I install it into "C:\Program Files\Apache Group", installation proceeds fine.

The version of MSI installer I use is downloaded from links on apache.org download page.
>How-To-Repeat:
I think, you can repeat it with selecting "Custom" setup and changing installation directory.
>Fix:
Throw away that buggy MicroShaft(r) installer. Or, release addition zip-package to win32-versions.

State-Changed-Why:

Please indicate which version of the installer you are
running by launching MSIEXEC and noting the version number.

Also, are you choosing the path through the custom install,
or the complete install?  Are you keying the path you want,
or choosing it from the filesystem browser?

 !!! Important note !!!
 
 After all problems with changing installation path I has to install
 Apache with "Complete Install" to default directory. After this, I
 tried to reinstall Apache with different path, and installation was
 successful.
 
 Anyway, I think this is still a problem, double installation isn't a
 good solution.
 
 wao> Please indicate which version of the installer you are

 Windows Installer V 1.20.1827.0
 
 wao> Also, are you choosing the path through the custom install,

 From custom install.
 
 wao> Are you keying the path you want,
 wao> or choosing it from the filesystem browser?
 
 Neither first, nor second. This message is poped-up directly after
 pressing "Change" button, before I can choose any path.

State-Changed-Why:

I've reproduced the problem by keying c:/foobar/apache
as the target path.  This is Windows, it only accepts
backslashes in this field.  I'll note that in the prompt
in the next release.  Thanks for your report, and interest
in the Apache httpd project!
