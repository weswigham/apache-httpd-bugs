I'm using Windows NT4 fp 6 as a workstation
>Description:
i found in the book "Professional Apache" by Peter Wainwright tha the module
mod_auth_nt can be found to solve the specific NT authentication aspect
as NT based authentication for users/groups.
Ican't get this module anywhere. Where can i find it because it could solve
our NT security problem using the uid & passwd from NT itself without special
file *.passwd &/or group file
Thanks for help

 Erm... don't ask us.  We have nothing to do with this module and have no
 idea where to look, except for the standard http://modules.apache.org/

 ok thanks for answer.
 Unfortunately that can't solve our problem.......
 Do you have the solution somewhere using Apache server and NT to get the userid
 and passwd from the NT user login and include these into Apache.By this way if it
 exist we can use one UID & PWD known by the system and have control on the
 directive AUTHUSERFILE or AUTHGROUPFILE.
 
 Best regards
