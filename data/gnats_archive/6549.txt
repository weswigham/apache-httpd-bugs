>Description:
Hello I would like to protect a directory with password and host limitation. 
I put Auth* directives and allow directive.
I am trying to access the protected directory from adrian.cicataqro.ipn.mx computer.
In error log appears that 

[Mon Sep 18 16:16:55 2000] [alert] [client 148.204.99.132] /home/httpd/html/vu/books/.htaccess: allow not allowed here

If I remove order directive from .htaccess file everything works fine.

Below you'll find content of .htaccess file
#
# restricted access to Virtual University
# Books Section
#
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Libros sobre Educacion a Distancia. Collecion Privada."
AuthUserFile  /etc/httpd/conf/users.conf
AuthGroupFile /etc/httpd/conf/groups.conf
require user ced2000
allow from .ipn.mx
Satisfy all

In /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  I have
#
# restricted access to Virtual University
#
<Directory /home/httpd/html/vu>
	AllowOverride AuthConfig Options
</Directory>

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.cicataqro.ipn.mx/vu/books/
(currently I have removed order directive so it is working)

Please see http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_access.html#allow, which 
clearly describes that "AllowOverride limit" is necessary for the 
"allow" directive.
