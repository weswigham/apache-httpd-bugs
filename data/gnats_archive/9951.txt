>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
I'm running Win 2000 Pro and have installed from the latest binary .msi file from www.apache.org/dist/httpd
>Description:
After installing this version of apache, I am unable to load the php_oci8 module with php.
Even when I try running php from the command line this occurs but only after upgrading.
Error message returned is:
The procedure entry point OCILobOpen could not be located in the dynamic link library OCI.dll.
Whilst this looks to be a Zend problem, it is only reproduced by a new apache installation. Even after uninstalling apache, this error still occurs.
If you comment out the oci8 extention in the php.ini file, the problem goes away.

I have tried installing different versions of php (4.0.6 and 4.1.1) but I receive this error with both. I have also been able to reproduce on another PC.
I have then tried re-installing php but the same problem persists.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a new or relatively new version of php on Win 2000 (I have not tested on othe Win OS' as to not mess up too many of my companies pc's) and install an old version of apache i.e. 1.3.9.
PHP should work.
Now upgrade apache 1.3.23 and you should find that upon starting php you get this error.
Remember to un-comment the oci8 extension in the php.ini file.
