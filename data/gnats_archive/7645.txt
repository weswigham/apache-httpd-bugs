Red Hat 7.0 Linux (kernel 2.2.16-22)

>Description:
ok, I have a formmail script that is correctly configured, paths are correct, etc. I have a test page with a form setup. If I specify a redirect directive in the HTML code:
        <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="http://63.86.48.102/thankyou.html">

it does NOT work. The email disapears, and I see nothing in the mail or apache logs related to it. If I do NOT specify any redirect page, the email is sent no problem. I am not sure if this is a sendmail or apache issue. Maybe there is some setting in Apache I a missing?
>How-To-Repeat:
http://63.86.48.102/application.html
>Fix:
No idea. formmail worked on an old Red Hat 6.2 machine that someone at my company had built some time ago, but they are no longer here and I have lost touch with that person. I have asked around on countless forums and mailing lists to no avail. No one has been able to come up with an answer.
