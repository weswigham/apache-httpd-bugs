Solaris 2.4, unpatched. gcc 2.7.2.x
>Description:
In this case, a GIF file, which is certainly 'OK' in general fails to
download from a virtual server.  It is not a client issue - direct
telnet confirms the problem.

The identical file will download fine from a different virtual host on the
same server.  Although the configs are not identical (of the two servers)
making them so does not change the problem.

Restarting the web server process does not fix the problem.  Sometimes,
but not always, copying the file will fix the problem.  It is as if the file
is 'locked' open (mmap()ed?).

The server will always report a succesful (status 200) access.  The client
will hang on 'host contacted, waiting for reply'

I have extensively investigated this problem, and it's either very stupid,
or very bizarre.  Although NFS is involved in our setup, I am confident that
is not relevant (I can replicate the problem on a non-NFS set up).

Although I have not tried to test it on another OS, I'm guessing that this is a
solaris problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem *is* rather erratic.  It can occasionally be made to go away
by copying files.

Currently, I have an example running as:

http://www.erik.co.uk/TNGirl.gif
http://www.eurotalk.co.uk/TNGirl.gif

You will, I hope, find that the one under 'erik' works fine, the one under
'eurotalk' doesn't.
>Fix:
Looks to me like something freaky to do with overrunning buffers, or 
similar

 I doubt it's directly an apache bug... but just in case it's related to
 the pthreads problems in 1.3b5 could you try 1.3b6-dev?  Visit
 ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs/ to find a snapshot of the current cvs
 code.
 
 BTW, solaris 2.4 unpatched is uh, unstable, and uh, lacking ;) 
 
 Oh wait.  Damn.  You're not using pthreads because they're only used in
 2.5 and later.
 
 Ok, edit main/http_protocol.c and add this:
 
 #undef USE_MMAP_FILES
 
 right before the first line that says
 
 #ifdef USE_MMAP_FILES

 USE_MMAP_FILES doesn't appear in my copy of http_protocol.c.
 
 I decided to go into conf.h, and (within the SOLARIS #ifdef) replace
 #define USE_MMAP_FILES with #undef USE_MMAP_FILES.
 
 However, the problem hasn't gone away.
 
 This is a very odd one - even actually restarting the server doesn't fix
 the 'broken' file.
 
 Unless you have any other ideas, I'm going to treat this as a Solaris bug,
 and convince my clients to upgrade (all the way to 2.6, I hope).

Yeah this really looks like a solaris 2.4 bug... you should
probably start by applying any recommended 2.4 patches.  You
could upgrade to 2.6 ... but you shouldn't need to go that far.

Tell us how it goes though, or if you get any more data.

 Yeah, well, I'd been advising them to for a while anyway.  The upgrade to
 2.6 has gone through, and the problem has vanished.  Indeed, performance
 has also improved by almost an order of magnitude...
 
 I regret not being able to investigate the problem as fully as I would
 like to, but time is pressured, and I have to move on...
 
 I advise anyone out there using 2.4 to move on to 2.6...
 
 Yours,
