RedHat Linux 5.2, apache 1.3.3 from RedHat rpm-package.
apache-1.3.3-1, glibc-2.0.7-29
>Description:
We are using apache and ProxyPass to hide the thing that our (and our custommers) websites have been split to several servers. ProxyPass is fine for this, except that it does not work correctly on this architecture.
Parts of site are on Microsoft IIS server (yuck), and other parts on apache server running on Linux
When we are using ProxyPass on apache server (1.3.4 running solaris) without any virtual-hosts everything runs fine.
But when I tried this same thing on RedHat Linux 5.2 (apache 1.3.3) problems exist.
When client requests url from this site apache adds lots of headers to those what IIS has generated (apache running on solaris does not add these headers)
These headers include Content-Location, which reveals information about servers (this address is from private address-space, so it does not work from outside world)
Lynx uses this content-location header to generate URLs of links. So lynx-users are unable to browse those pages.
This server has Name-based virtual hosts in use.

no.
Header unset Content-Location does not fix this.

Try using "UseCanonicalName Off" on your backend-servers.

 I investigted this more. And you are right that the backend server adds
 that header.
 It adds when requesting an URI like: http://www.somesite.com/something/
 and it adds Content-Location: http://www.somesite.com/something/index.html
 
 The problem here is that in many cases these backend servers are not very
 configurable. I am unable to strip that Content-Location header with that
 backend-servers that sends it.
 
 Apache module mod_headers has the ability to unset http-headers, 
 but it seems that it won't work with ProxyPass.
 I added lines like this to my httpd.conf:
 
 ProxyPass /somelocation http://somesite/someplace/
 ProxyPassReverse /somelocation http://somesite/someplace/
 Header unset Content-Location
 
 Apache did not strip Content-Location header with this configuration
 
 
 I also tried this:
 
 <Location /somelocation>
 Header unset Content-Location
 </Location>
 
 But apache still did not strip Content-Location headers.
 
 
 So I would like to see mod_headers and ProxyPass working together
