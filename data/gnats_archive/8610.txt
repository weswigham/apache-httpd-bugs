>Description:

When doing server-side includes using the "file" or "virtual" directive, e.g.

<!--#include virtual="stupidname.txt"" -->

Any file extension may be used. In the above example, I used ".txt"

HOWEVER, if you want to do *nested* includes, the file
name MUST have the ".shtml" extension, e.g.

<!--#include virtual="stupidname.shtml"" -->

Inside of stupidname.shtml, you might have another include which
also must end in ".shtml", e.g.

<!--#include virtual="insidestupid.shtml"" -->


This clarification is important because some web servers,
like MS IIS, let you use other extensions, such as ".stm"
for nested SSI's. Also, the fact that you can use any
file extension for regular SSI's, but must use ".shtml"
for nested SSI's, needs to be spelled out in the docs.

State-Changed-Why:

I don't think your assessment is correct.

Apache uses exactly the same technique to determine whether
a nested include should itself be parsed as it uses to
determine whether an original document should be parsed.

In other words, try accessing the nested document directly.
If it is parsed that way, it will also be parsed when you
get it via "#include virtual".  You perhaps need to check
the AddHandler configuration in httpd.conf to make sure
that it designates the appropriate document extensions
as server-parsed.  There is nothing magical about .shtml.

Thanks for using Apache!
