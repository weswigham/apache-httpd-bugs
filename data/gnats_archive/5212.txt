Make apache log in a server log why it's issuing 500 errors.

Otherwise it's damn hard to track the cause of the problem

 Hi,
 
 We suggest the following changes in the file
 http_request.c in Apache core  to log the cause in
 error_log file, when "satisfy any" in the config file
 without any related conf lines used.
 
 static void process_request_internal(request_rec *r)
 {      
        int access_status;
        ....
        ....
        case SATISFY_ANY:
         if (((access_status = ap_check_access(r)) !=
 0) || !ap_auth_type(r)) {
 -           if (!ap_some_auth_required(r)) {
 +           if (!ap_some_auth_required(r) &&
 (((access_status = ap_check_user_id
 (r)) != 0) || !ap_auth_type(r))) {     
 			                 decl_die(access_status,
 ap_auth_type(r)
     ? "check access"
 -   : "perform authentication. AuthType not set!", r);
 +   : "Satisfy any directive must be used along with
 both allow and require directives..!",r);
             return;
             }
             ....
             ....
             ....
 }

 vsolve_apache.
