Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-unknown-linux-gnulibc1/2.7.2.3/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
After I do these commands:
 cd apache_1.2.6/src/;  ./Configure  ; make
then the following errors come out (I have no problem compiling Apache1.3b5(6) )

(cd regex; make lib CC='gcc' AUX_CFLAGS='-O2 -DLINUX=2 ' RANLIB='ranlib')
make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/apache_1.2.6/src/regex'
rm -f *.o
sh ./mkh  -i _REGEX_H_ regex2.h regcomp.c regerror.c regexec.c regfree.c >regex.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I don't think this is the problem with Apache itself, but I don't
know what is wrong since Apache1.3b5 or Apache1.3b6 compiles but
Apache1.2.5 or Apache1.2.6 fail to compile.

 What directory is your egrep in?
 
 Try removing the "PATH=/bin:/usr/bin ; export PATH" line from the start of
 src/regex/mkh.
