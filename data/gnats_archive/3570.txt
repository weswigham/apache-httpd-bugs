Any OS
>Description:
If you have multiple AddLanguage with the same file extension, the LAST
one will be used for "reverse" lookups (extension to language mapping),
but all of them will be used for "forward" lookups (language to extension).
This does not seem to be mentioned in the documentation.
It would be very helpful if the default srm.conf had a note added to explain
this behaviour.
>How-To-Repeat:
If someone is not aware of this, she might use
AddLanguage en .en
AddLanguage en-us .en
AddLanguage en-uk .en

Then, the language reported for all documents with the .en ending would 
be "en-uk".
>Fix:
Add a note in the default srm.conf.dist and document the behaviour in the
mod_mime documentation .../mod/mod_mime.html#addlanguage

State-Changed-Why:

This note has been added to the mom_mime documentation for
the next release after 1.3.6.  The config files have not
been updated, though, because this behaviour occurs for
several other directives and documenting only one isn't
the Right Thing.  People can read the docco if things seem
confusing; the config files contain comments, not
documentation.  Thanks for the report and for using Apache!
