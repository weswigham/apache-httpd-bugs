mod_proxy, with a custom patch
>Description:
I want to deny proxy requests coming from a specific IP address.
I have the following in my config:

  <Directory proxy:*>
  order allow,deny
  deny from 123.45.6.78
  </Directory>

where 123.45.6.78 is a test IP address that I want to deny.

Yet all requests from that IP address succeed.  It leaves that
IP address in the logs too.

When I use "deny from all", it still lets the requests through!

I've looked through the bug reports and found a couple of mentions
of similar problems, but no solutions that worked for me.  I've
tried variations, such as Files, DirectoryMatch, Location, and
LocationMatch, all to no avail.

 Hi,
 We suggest the following changes in the httpd.conf
 file for
 "deny from all" inside a <Directory: proxy:*> to work.
 Uncomment the "ProxyRequests on" line in httpd.conf
 file.setting the ProxyRequests directive to on allows
 Apache to function as a proxy server.
 
 ie., in httpd.conf file
 
 <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
 ProxyRequests on
 
 <Directory proxy:*>
 order allow,deny
 deny from all
 </Directory>  
 ........
 ........
 ........                   
 </IfModule>
 # End of proxy directives.

 Thanks for your reply.  However, "ProxyRequests On" is already
 uncommented
 in my httpd.conf file, and the apache is successfully proxying requests.
 
 The only problem here is that I can't get it to deny requests from any
 IP

 Do you have any ideas for how I can further diagnose or fix the problem?

 Hi,
 To deny proxy requests from any IP addresses you can
 use ProxyBlock directive.
 
 ie., in httpd.conf file
 
 <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
 ProxyRequests on
 ProxyBlock 172.16.1.110 172.16.1.190
 ........
 ........
 </IfModule>
 
 where 172.16.1.110 and 172.16.1.190 are the IP
 addresses that are denied for proxy requests.

 Thanks again for your reply.  However, I think your answer is still not
 right.  The documentation on www.apache.org says that ProxyBlock lets
 you
 block requests TO the listed addresses, not FROM the listed addresses.
 I am looking for the correct way to block requests FROM certain IP
 addresses.
 
 I appreciate your taking the time to investigate this problem.  I've
 reproduced the problem with a different build of Apache too:
 Apache 1.3.6 with mod_perl (without mod_proxy, etc.).  So I
 think that it's really a core Apache problem.  Can you try to
 reproduce the problem?
 
 Are there other people in the Apache bug-fix community who
 should be involved in this problem?

 Thanks again for your reply.  However, I think your answer is still not
 right.  The documentation on www.apache.org says that ProxyBlock lets
 you
 block requests TO the listed addresses, not FROM the listed addresses.
 I am looking for the correct way to block requests FROM certain IP
 addresses.
 
 I appreciate your taking the time to investigate this problem.  I've
 reproduced the problem with a different build of Apache too:
 Apache 1.3.6 with mod_perl (without mod_proxy, etc.).  So I
 think that it's really a core Apache problem.  Can you try to
 reproduce the problem?
 
 Are there other people in the Apache bug-fix community who
 should be involved in this problem?
