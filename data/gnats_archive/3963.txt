>Environment:
Digital Unix 4.0D 
>Description:
httpsd processes multiply when the following RewriteRule is triggered in the
1.3.3 web server (Stronghold):

RewriteRule ^/(mum)$ https://arden1.mcis.washington.edu:4443/$1 [P]

BTW...the rewrite rule doesn't work correctly in addition.

For us.  this puts our web server over our user process kernel limit and we can
no longer kill the httpsd process.
>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
I don't know how to fix this..or exactly what causes this.  I'd love to know.

This database is only for problems with the Apache base

vendor.
