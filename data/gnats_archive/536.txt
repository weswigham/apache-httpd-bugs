>Environment:
Running on HP-UX 10.20
>Description:
If httpd is configured to run as user ``nobody'', you'll get
errors claiming that: 
	
	shmctl: Invalid argument
	httpd: Could not set segment #XXX

(with some number for XXX)
>How-To-Repeat:
Just do it!  Or if you can't, I'll provie an account on a HPUX machine
to demonstrate.
>Fix:
Run httpd as any other user - www, for instance.  And put it 
somewhere in the docs, preferably in a comment in httpd.con
