>Environment:
NT4SP3, microsoft java sdk 3.0
>Description:
The inner classes JServInputStream and JServOutputStream access the private members "in" and "out", respectively, of JServConnection. This is caught by Microsoft's jview in java sdk 3.0.

This bug manifests itself as not getting any output returned from the servlet and getting an illegal access exception.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run jserv on NT with Microsoft's Java SDK v3.0 (see www.microsoft.com/java for download, I recommend using the separate .exe downloads and not trying to use their brain-damaged internet install wizard)
>Fix:
my fix was to add private "in" and "out" members to JServInputStream and JServOutputStream, respectively, and to initialize these in the constructor, e.g.,

   public JServInputStream(InputStream in) {
      available = getContentLength();
      this.in = in;
   }

a similar change is made for JServOutputStream, as well as changing the calls to the constructors to provide the "in" and "out" arguments.

State-Changed-When: Sun Oct 25 23:09:21 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:

This is fixed in the latest version of JServSSI.  You can
get this with the latest snapshot of the JServ source tree
(the 0.9.x tree is no longer in development); the snapshots
are available from http://java.working-dogs.com/daily/

This bug will be marked closed when a checkpointed version
of the 1.0b development tree is released, unless we hear
that this is still a problem.
