Solaris 2.5.1, gcc 2.7.2
SunOS theson 5.5 Generic_103093-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
I use the following command as part of rotating log files at the end of each day:

    kill -HUP `cat httpd.pid`

This works for release 1.2; however, with release 1.2.1 this causes all the 
webservers to die.
