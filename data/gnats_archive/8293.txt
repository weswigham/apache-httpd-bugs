>Description:
After configuring appache jserve. I'm trying to run my servlet and getting server error 500. When looking in the error log (mod_jserv) file it says 
"[05/09/2001 01:35:01:240] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: connection fail
[05/09/2001 01:35:01:240] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "ajpv12"
I looke in several references on the web and it looks like my configuration is correct, but still I get the erro. I guess I still have misconfiguration of the Apache Jserv. Can somebody please suggest how can I fix my problem, or at least give some reference which can help me to configure the server.
Thanx
