I have bring the server (apache.1.2.0) up on 
       http://www.weltbild.de:8000/
       User:     apache
       Password: bug
But try it fast, please, because this is an port where other people
look, too. 

If you try this with Netscape or IE <=3.01 there is no Problem
but with IE3.02 there is a bug!!!

I hope you understand my bad english.
