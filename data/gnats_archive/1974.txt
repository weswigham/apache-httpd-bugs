>Description:
'tis very simple.  this is the only log file i'm aware of that encounters this condition.

i have root owned dirs for apache.  i just realised why the ScriptLog directive never worked on my machine.

apache runs as user 'httpd'.  i needed to make logs/ and logs/<file> owned by user 'httpd'

not too critical of a situation, more a matter of inconsistency as all other log files appear to be created/updated as root.
>How-To-Repeat:
n/r
>Fix:
setuid(0) when creating/writing this logfile....i won't make a patch as this is probably a one+one liner or close to it :).

State-Changed-Why:
We can't just magically become root at any time we want during server exection.
If we could, that would be a rather large security hole.
This file is explicitly documented as being opened by
the user Apache runs as, and it is explicitly noted that
you have to set the permissions as appropriate.
