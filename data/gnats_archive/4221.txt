>Environment:
Linux RedHat 5.2.  I assume this is in every config file, however.
>Description:
The default httpd.conf-dist seemed to be incorrect about how to allow users to have public_html directories accessible (I wanted to change to allow Indexes, in this case).

Instead of the line <Directory /*/public_html>, I had to use the line <Directory ~ /*/public_html> before the configuration file changes to the Options tag (but presumable any information inside that <Directory> area) would work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the default httpd.conf and try to get a directory index (a directory without an DirectoryIndex specified file in it, usually a file listing of all things in the directory).
>Fix:
Modify the default httpd.conf-dist.  The line:

<Directory /*/public_html>

Should really be this, I think:

<Directory ~ /*/public_html>

... because it makes it work. :)

State-Changed-Why:
You probably want <Directory /home/*/public_html> ...
The example is silly -- * matches only a single component.
I changed the example.
