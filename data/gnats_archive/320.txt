Works fine here.  Try invoking one in the same directory or using "include
virtual" instead of exec cgi.  

This is something that really needs to be taken up with the person
maintaining the web server since we have no way to know what they have
done.  

If they have installed suEXEC (program to run CGIs as the user) that could
change things, but it is simply wild guessing to try to say anything
without knowing the server setup.
