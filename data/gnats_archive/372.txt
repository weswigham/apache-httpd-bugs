Any operating system with GNU make.
>Description:
I'm building modules using a flex parser, and I'm having a conflict
between Apache's Makefile and GNU make.  The variable LFLAGS is
used by Apache for linker flags, but it has already has a special
meaning for make when used with Lex:

Lex for C programs
     `N.c' is made automatically from `N.l' by by running Lex.  The
     actual command is `$(LEX) $(LFLAGS)'.
>How-To-Repeat:
-
>Fix:
I currently work around this by overriding make's default rule for Lex
files, but it might be worth changing the name of the variable within
Apache.  Should all occurences of LFLAGS be changed to LDFLAGS?%0
