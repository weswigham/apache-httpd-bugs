I have run into a hard problem to fix. Looked at the faq's and they help with most but not all.

When I upgraded to 1.3b5 from 1.2b7 and try to access certian home pages I get "access denied", when I put the older relese back into the system it works fine. With the new release I was changing access to nobody from root. This is a signup server that had scripts that needed the root execute untill we re-worked them.

Now that we re-wrote them we would like to be able to get it all working. In the error logs I have the following error's when I accessed some of thos pages.

They mention .htpasswd file but there is no such file in home page directories.

Any help would be great.
