 Hi,
 
 I'm trying to reproduce this bug, but can't.
 
 Which version of JServ are you trying to build ? 
 Which java compiler are you using ?
 
 Thanks.

 I use java 1.2 from HP (hpux).
 
 ApacheJServ-1.1b3  and JSDK-2.0
 
 
 Thanks for any help.

 I too am having this problem building JServ-1.1b3
 
 SunOS 5.6 Generic_105181-16 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise.
 gcc-2.8.1, GNU make 3.78.1, Sun JDK 1.1.8, JSDK2.0
 
 I'm not a Java person, but a co-worker says its a problem with the .java
 source itself and the error (org.apache.jserv.JServConnection is an abstract
 class. It can't be instantiated) is accurate.

 Ok, this definitely shows that you are NOT using JSDK 2.0. This method
 doesn't exist in that version, it is: isRequestedSessionIdFromUrl (notice
 the lowercase Url)...
 
 What I'm guessing is that you have another version of the JSDK in your
 CLASSPATH env setting and that is where the confusion is happening.

State-Changed-Why:
I examined my CLASSPATH and sure enough, jsdk2.1/server.jar is in there.  I
figured specifying the JSDK on the configure command-line would have
overridden this.  What's the point of specifying this?

I placed JSDK2.0/lib/jsdk.jar before the jsdk2.1 references and everything
compiled fine.  I'll have to test it tonight.

Thanks for your help.
