State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly a basic configuration problem;
this is for bug reports, we can't answer every user
support question.

It appears that you don't have your server configured to
treat the file in question as a CGI.  You need the proper
AddType directive and need to have "Options ExecCGI"
enabled in the directory.  This is in the docs and the FAQ.
