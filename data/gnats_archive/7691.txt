>Organization:
>Environment:
Solaris 7, but the 'problem' exists wherever the distributed apachectl is used
>Description:
The bin/apachectl binary doesn't support the use of command line arguments to httpd.  I use a version hacked to support this.

It also fixes what I think is a bug: the server status is re-checked for each
argument, because the code is within the loop.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try

  apachectl start -DOI

(which is what I use to start a differently configured 'OI' server)
and notice that httpd gets started without the -DOI flag.
>Fix:
Adapt <A HREF="http://www.win.tue.nl/~rp/util/apache/apachectl">my version</A> (the indentation is imperfect to make the diff return only true differences) or implement the same idea in a different way.

State-Changed-Why:

I think it would be a mistake to mix httpd command line
options with apachectl command line options.  They
are designed to be different, and allowing both would
be highly confusing.

Instead, the proper course of action is to make
whatever local modifications are necessary to apachectl.
The script as distributed is not intended to cover
every situation.

Thanks for using Apache!
