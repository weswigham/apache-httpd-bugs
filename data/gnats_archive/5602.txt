>Description:
I've found a bug in AdaptiveClassLoader.loadResourceFromZipfile. This
method returns an InputStream with zipfile.getInputStream from within the
main block of a try/catch/finally statement and then calls zipfile.close
from within the finally block of the same.  When I commented out the
finally block of the try/catch/finally, it works fine.  (This is how it
was up through 1.1b3.)

Grossly paraphrased it's doing this:

try {
        ...
        return zipfile.getInputStream(entry);
        ...
} catch (IOException ex) {
        return null;
} finally {
        ...
        zipfile.close();
        ...
}

>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to load property file from repository jar file.
>Fix:
Remove finally block, zipfile should close when gc'd.

 On JDK 1.1.8 (Linux) I get a NullPointerException when attempting to read
 from the return InputStream while in JDK 1.3 (Win32) I get an IOException
 - "Bad File Descriptor".
