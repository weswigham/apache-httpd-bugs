>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
I am using Solaris,BSDI,Linux, etc. gcc and ProC compilers
>Description:
I wrote and maintain mod_backhand.  Like any proxying module, it benefits
TREMENDOUSLY from KeepAlives being turned on on the backend servers.  However,
mod_backhand doesn't differentiate between front-end and backend.  Thus, one has
to enable KeepAlive for everyone or disable them completely.

I need an KeepAlives On/Off/Network (where Network could be of the form IP/mask)

Or, code needs to be added to the apache source tree to change it.  I hate to
distribute a patch to Apache with mod_backhand, because I like the fact that
one can use it with apxs.  The patch I have is as follows, please consider it or
more flexible alternatives (like KeepAlives that takes a network adresses as
parameters).
>How-To-Repeat:
Sure, install mod_backhand, and try to turn on KeepAlives from fellow machines 
in your cluster, but disable them from everwhere else.  It is a fundamental 
configuration limitation.
