>Description:
In our servlet we have a thread that polls for database updates. When we upload a new set of classes, the servlet is reinitialised with the new classes, and a new thread is created, however the old thread is not destroyed. This means that we have multiple database update threads. Whilst this is not a critical problem it does lead to us using up all of our database driver licences after some time.
>How-To-Repeat:
There is unfortunately no publicly available URL. A simple Servlet using a thread and showing a list of all threads in the group should support this though.
>Fix:
Possibly starting the main Servlet in a new threadgroup and then killing all threads in that group on class reload would solve the problem.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: p.fumagalli@fumagalli.org
State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 29 07:15:24 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
The servlet engine is not supposed to kill threads created in init()
method of the servlet.
As described in the API specs, you should close your thread in
the servlet's destroy() method.
