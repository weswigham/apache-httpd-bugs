>Organization:
>Environment:
SunOS hurricane 5.5.1 Generic_103640-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
There is currently no way to have the ReadmeName and HeaderName files be
considered to be "server-parsed". This makes it impossible to use SSI
directives in these files, limiting their usefulness in some cases.
>How-To-Repeat:
With README.shtml, the file is not even recognized (when a handler has been
added for .shtml). XBitHack appears to have the same problem.
>Fix:
Not specifically, but it sounds like ReadmeName and HeaderName aren't aware of
the existance of server-parsed documents (much like mod_cgi), and so they are
incapable of being parsed (just like the output of a CGI script cannot be
server-parsed)

State-Changed-Why:
You're correct; the Readme and Header files are not
handled like normal subrequests.  This is something that
we hope to change, but it might not happen until some
version after 1.3.  I am suspending this report so we won't
forget about the issue.  Thank you for submitting it, and
for using Apache!

State-Changed-When: Tue Aug  7 06:13:58 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Filters in Apache 2.0 change all this (and SSI parsed
README and HEADER files have worked since 1.3.6.)
