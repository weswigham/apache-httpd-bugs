>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 SP1
Visual C++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
Any CGI executable that I run via a common cgi-bin URL will fail for Apache running on the Windows platform.  It appears that Apache is putting quotes around the unqualified part of the filename. If a shell were being run, that might work. However, actual programs are run under Win32 with CreateProcess which expects a valid filename. Embedded quotes are taken as part of the filename, not as "meta-characters" to be stripped off.
>How-To-Repeat:
This needs to be attempted on the Win32 platform.
Create an executable CGI application and put it in the configured cgi-bin directory e.g. C:/Apache/cgi-bin. I'm using one called "printenv.cgi". 
Invoke it with a URL like:
    http://localhost/cgi-bin/printenv.cgi

You will get an error in the browser, and the error log will contain a message such as the following:
[Wed Nov 22 15:04:44 2000] [error] [client 0.0.0.0] (22123)The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.  : couldn't create child process: 22123: e:/apache/cgi-bin/printenv.cgi
[Wed Nov 22 15:04:44 2000] [error] [client 0.0.0.0] couldn't spawn child process: c:/apache/cgi-bin/printenv.cgi
>Fix:
Line 471 of src/modules/standard/mod_cgi.c (specific to WIN32). Change it to
    quoted_filename = apr_pstrcat(p, "\"", r->filename, "\"", NULL);

It seems to be okay to quote the entire filename, but not just the tail.

I don't know why the filename is being quoted, though. This fix may affect scripts that need to be passed to an interpreter of some sort.
