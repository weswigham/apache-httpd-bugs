>Description:

I've tried 1.3.14 (can't find patch file referenced in other bug reports for this same problem, or I WOULD try that). Also, 1.3.17 with an apparent 'patch', and 1.3.19. All yield the same result; mod_rewrite doesn't expand the $1 token in a rewrite map: 

RewriteEngine on
RewriteLogLevel 9
RewriteLog  /home/httpd/logs/rewrite.log
RewriteMap    cloak       prg:/home/httpd/cgi-bin/cloak/cloak.cgi
RewriteRule   ^/(.+\.(html|htm|php|php3))$ /${cloak:$1} [L]

${cloak:$1} doesn't expand. 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I've seen references to a 1.3.14 patch file, but apparently it's been taken down?

 Figures, just after sending the bug report I figure it out.
 
 Stupid operator error, didn't realize that I had to copy the modules 
 into place (wasn't using make install for fear of copying over 
 something live.. ).
 
 sorry, 1.3.19 works fine.
