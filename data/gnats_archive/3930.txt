>Description:
When I add new users to the system, and we place a index.html file in thier
directory (the one in srm.conf for the home directotyr) it will give me
a 403 forbidden error, HOWEVER all the users that were ont he system BEFORE
I upgraded can be viewed, and people in a alternate dir /home/www can be 
viewed.. so I dunno why..

>Fix:
I see having to add each new users to the access.conf, but I'm sure there is 
a better way.
