>Description:
Problem appears to be within SuEXEC:  Users with a dash (-) in their userid (NOT domain) get a 500 Internal Server Error.
/etc/password and httpd.conf specify the proper username with the dash, however the suexec.log file shows:

...
[2000-04-17 15:51:26]: notice: username/groupname mapping = stutzla/customer
[2000-04-17 15:51:27]: notice: (www.stutz.com) -> stutzla
[2000-04-17 15:51:27]: notice: username/groupname mapping = stutzla/customer
[2000-04-17 15:51:28]: crit: invalid target user name: (stutzla)
...

/etc/passwd:

stutz-la:EPKcTh63jxcp.:2979:1001:customer:/mnt/netapp/home/stutz:/bin/sh

.. and the VirtualHost entry clearly states:

  User stutz-la
  Group customer

... and I went ahead and replaced suexec with a shell script to log the command line options to a file...

stutz-la customer test.cgi

.. showing that Apache is passing the proper userid to suexec.  Suexec is somehow filtering out -'s.

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a user and virtualhost with ScriptAlias for CGI with suexec.  I am using name-based hosting, unknown if that is a factor.
Userid associated with the virtualhost needs to have a - in it.
Attempt to run a cgi, noting logfile entries.
>Fix:
I'm about to dive into support/suexec.c now...:-)

 I managed to trace this down to a non-apache issue (change by a 
 co-worker).. Please disregard this case.
 
 Thanks!
