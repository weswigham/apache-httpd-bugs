>Description:
When protecting a directory with some kind of authentification
(both AuthUserFile and AuthExternal tested) in .htaccess or
access.conf (both tested) and defining ErrorDocument 401 in
srm.conf nobody is prompted for username/password and gets
directly the document pointed by the ErrorDocument 401.
>How-To-Repeat:
----- srm.conf ------
ErrorDocument 401 http://web.ols.es/messages/401.html
---- access.conf ----
<Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/test>
AllowOverride All
Options Indexes
AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/test.psw
AuthName TEST
AuthType Basic
order deny,allow
allow from all
<Limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</Limit>
</Directory>

State-Changed-Why:
There are several closed PRs in the database on this same
subject, and it is documented in the FAQ.  You can not
use a remote URL due to the way authentication works.
You have to use one on the local server, ie. in the
form /messages/401.html not http://foo/message/401.html.

 The only solution I can think of offhand would be a global alias that
 mapped a certain path under each virtual domain to the main server.

 The normal way of notifiying a client that authorization is required is to
 send a 401 response.  That notifies the client that authorization is
 required.  The normal way to tell the client that authorization failed is
 to send another 401 with a failure message.
 
 If you have an ErrorDocument for 401 responses that points to a http://
 URL, then Apache must send a redirect with a Location: header to tell the
 client to get that resource.  That means it can't send a 401 which means
 the client never knows authorization is required.  URLs without a method
 can be handled as internal redirects, without sending one to the client,
 avoiding this problem.  In your case, since it is on the same server, it
 would be possible for Apache to look at the URL and figure out that it
 really is on the same server and do the internal rewrite, but that is a
 complicated issue and can be a bad thing to do.
