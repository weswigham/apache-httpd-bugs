SunOS atlas 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
Solaris 2.6 seems to have a bug in ifconfig so that one must do an extra
ifconfig le0:0 x.x.x.x (machines REAL IP) after you have set the virtual interfaces.
This is because it seems like solaris 2.6 assumes that the last ifconfig command made is 
setting the machines real IP, which is not the case.

Example, i now only have 1 virtual interface, ifconfig shows:
le0: flags=863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
        inet 194.18.134.14 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 194.18.134.255
        ether 8:0:20:82:bd:d 
le0:1: flags=843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
        inet 194.18.134.220 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 194.18.134.255

this is how the machine looks after a reboot. And this makes the server to think that
its real IP is 194.18.134.220 (which causes IP-checkers looking for 194.18.134.14 to refuse our connections).

So what i discovered is that if i do ifconfig le0:0 194.18.134.14 up , the machine
appears on it's real IP again. But after aprx. 5mins the webserver stop to respond
to the virtual interfaces IP (194.18.134.220).  I can still ping all IP's fully, and telnet 
to port 80 and the webserver responds.. but it will not load the pages that
are supposed to show on 194.18.134.220, but on 194.18.134.14 the server still 
responds as it should..
>How-To-Repeat:
the following are the only modifications on any services on our machine,
ndd -set /dev/ip ip_enable_group_ifs 0
ndd -set /dev/ip ip_forwarding 1

so to reproduce the problem, do:
ifconfig le0:1 x.x.x.x up
ifconfig le0:0 x.x.x.x (machines REAL IP)
and of course configure up a webserver to respond to both adresses. wait 3-10 mins
and you should se that webpages under le0:1 will not load.

State-Changed-Why:

Are you 'plumbing' the physical interface before
defining any virtual interfaces?
e.g. 

  ifconfig le0 x.x.x.x plumb
  ifconfig le0:1 y.y.y.y


And what about 'ip_enable_group_ifs'?
Have you intentionally disabled this feature?
Can you reproduce the problem when 
'ip_enable_group_ifs' is set to '1'?

 No, I am not plumbing. Is that necessary, everything looks ok in ifconfig -a.

 yes, to disable roundrobing on the interface.
 
 >Can you reproduce the problem when 
 >'ip_enable_group_ifs' is set to '1'?
 
 Yes it is reproducable with that too.

 According to Andreas Norman:

 Well, the ifconfig man pages says mentions this.
 
 But I think I was able to reproduce your problem...
 On a Sparc 5 test machine running Solaris 2.6 I added a virtual interface
 and in the beginning everything worked without problems.
 
 After pinging both IPs for some time the machine stopped to respond on both
 IPs I configured for the physical interface.
 
 This looks like a Solaris bug to me (or we are both doing something
 wrong ;-) and isn't caused by Apache, because Apache wasn't running when
 I tested it.
 
 Please ask in a Solaris newsgroup for help or talk to your vendor
 (maybe there's a patch available).
 
 Feedback welcome.
 
 Regards...

 Is NFS involved in any way?  If yes, then try using the LockFile directive
 like "LockFile /var/tmp/htlock" to move it away from NFS.
 
 Does the /server-status page show there are idle children?  If not,
 what are they doing?  If they're stuck in DNS lookup then either disable
 HostnameLookups, or turn off the solaris name caching daemon... whose
 name escapes me at the moment.
 
 Are you using multiple Listen statements?
 
 Can you reproduce this on a server which is running on a different port,
 and using the -X option?  This will cause it to run only a single child.
 If you can't reproduce it with -X then try setting MaxSpareServers
 to 2, MinSpareServers to 1, and see if you can reproduce it that way.
 Keep trying to increase MaxSpare until you can reproduce it.
 
 Once you've got it to reproduce like this, use truss to find out what
 system call each child is doing.  If they're all idle, then all but one
 of them should be in fcntl(), the rest should be in select().

 I did not manage to solve the actual problem. So I had to stop using virtual
 interfaces. I did ask Sun about this too, but they only said it was a
 problem within Apache causing this.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm sorry, but we can't help you with your problem.
In my opinion this is either a configuration error
regarding your interface setup or it is a Solaris bug,
because there isn't much Apache can do wrong when dealing
with virtual interfaces.

I know several people who use Apache on
Solaris 2.5/6 boxes with hundreds of virtual interfaces
without any problems (I'm using Solaris myself)
and we have currently no similar reports from other
Solaris users.
