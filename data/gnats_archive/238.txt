>Description:
I've been successfully accessing my apache 1.2b7 web server's html docs over our LAN but I don't see any cache files in /usr/local/etc/httpd/proxy (CacheRoot).

I've already set the ProxyRequests to ON, and also uncommented the CacheNegotiatedDocs. CacheSize is 50 right now. It was 5 before, but it also didn't work.

State-Changed-Why:
Check in the subdirectories under CacheRoot. The actual
cached files will be CacheSize - 1 directory levels down
under it. Your cache size is 50 kbytes, so you may not find
many files there.

State-Changed-Why:
Cache files are found several directory levels down from
the CacheRoot, specifically they are CacheDirLevels down
from it.
