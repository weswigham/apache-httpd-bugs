>Description:
Greetings,

I tried hard to find this in the bug database and elsewhere, so I think it's a new bug. I'm trying to create an Alias "http://localhost/mamamia": 

I have a directory "C:/hello/myalias" containing an index.html file.
If I enter the following entry for my alias:
Alias /mamamia "C:/hello/myalias" 

,restart Apache and then access URL "http://localhost/mamamia" the browser times-out after a while and I get a TCP_ERROR.
 
If I try to access the URL "http://localhost/mamamia/" the index page is displayed successfully.

Not dure if it's helpful, but if I change the Alias entry as follows:
Alias /mamamia "C:/hello/myalias/"
i.e add a trailing slash to the "real" directory name, restart Apache and then access the URL "http://localhost/mamamia/" again I get different behaviour - this time the directory root of C:/hello/myalias is displayed showing that it contains the file index.html (rather than displaying the CONTENTS of the index.html file as it does above).

This behaviour is not consistent with that described in the documentation nor articles I read about Apache aliases.

LOGS
-----
no error.log
access.log contains:
127.0.0.1 - - [18/Oct/2001:12:30:56 +0200] "GET /mamamia HTTP/1.1" 301 323
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an alias not ending in a slash and try and access in a URL that also DOES NOT CONTAIN A SLASH. If the URL ends in a slash there is no problem.
>Fix:
Nope - sorry.

 BTW I forgot to mention I added the necessary
 Directory directive to enable access to the myalias
 directory. If I use URL
 "http://localhost/mamamia/index.html that works fine -
 but I would expect that when I call URL
 "http://localhost/mamamia" the webserver should retrun
 be the index.html in the myalias directory.
