>Description:
Default installation of Apache comes with welcome page in several languages(index.html.xx). The correct ISO 639 language code for Czech is "cs" not "cz". Due this problem, Apache didn't serve correct welcome page for Czech users after installation.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set preferences of languages in your browser to Czech (cs).
>Fix:
Rename index.html.cz to index.html.cs.
