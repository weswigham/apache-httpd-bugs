IRIX 6.2 ( IRIX64 6.2 IP19 )
>Description:
Apache 1.2.4 will not accept any more then 138 virtual hosts which have their
own error/access logs. A system trace ends in:-

WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3
29849mS[ 0]     httpd( 1659): fcntl(3, F_DUPFD, 15) = 186
29849mS[ 0]     httpd( 1659): close(3) OK

29849mS[ 0]     httpd( 1659): lseek64(186, 0, SEEK_END) = 406
29849mS[ 0]     httpd( 1659): open(/usr/ns-home/https-xxxxxxx/logs/errors, O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3

OVERFLOW: total so far 35867
OVERFLOW: total so far 36137
OVERFLOW: total so far 36957
OVERFLOW: total so far 39179

Increasing the file descriptor limits by changing rlimit_nofile_cur from its
default of 200 to 1024 makes no difference.

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug in Apache, but rather a limit of your
OS.

Please read the FAQ (http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ#fdlim) and
the page on descriptors (http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/descriptors.html).

It is very unlikely that this is a bug in Apache, and this
is asked all the time, zillions of copies in the bugs database
that you should easily be able to find, and is well documented
in the above files.

In this case, IRIX 6.2 doesn't support FILE structures
with descriptors above 255 unless on a 64 bit machine or
compiling with the n32 ABI.  You may be able to work around
this using the HIGH_SLACK_LINE described in the docs above
or compiling using the n32 ABI; eg. add -n32 to the command
line if using SGI's cc.  This is an OS-specific issue.

 I apologise if I came across as just another dumb user who hadn't RTFM,
 but I did read the URLs you quote above aswell as a load of SGI web pages
 on file descriptors and searched the web/usenet for any related info.
 I came to the conclusion it was an OS issue and managed to increase the
 file descriptors available by using the systune command and setting
 the RLIMIT_NOFILE_CUR to 1024. Since then, both the hard and soft limits
 are set to 1024 rather than 200. But the problem still occurs at exactly
 the same point.

 We are running it on a Challenge DM but, as I didn't do the compile,
 Im not sure whether the -n32 option was specified. I will try a recompile
 with the -n32.
 
 Thank you for your help.
