Error: When manually trying to start the service in the services console.

"Could not start apache service on local computer
Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly"

Note:* I get the same error even when changing the logon account in 
services to administrator or apache.

The windows manager's event veiwer loggs the problem as an error due to a logon error for the service. I set the logon to use the apache account and made sure it was a member of the administrator group, which it is. Still recieved the same error after refreshing the services manager.
>How-To-Repeat:
By trying to manually start the service fro the services console.

No errors are displayed when trying to run the web server as an application instead of a service.

[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows and related 
newsgroups.  Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!

Also, try running apache from the command line to determine
what the configuration error is, before trying to start the
service.
