I run Apache 1.2b10 on Linux 2.0.25, but this is a general suggestion.
>Description:
From draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-08, page 125, section 14.15 ("Content-Location"):

    The Content-Location entity-header field MAY be used to
    supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the
    message when that entity is accessible from a location
    separate from the requested resource's URI.

    ...a server SHOULD provide a Content-Location
    for the resource corresponding to the response entity.

I would very much like you to consider emitting a "Content-Location:"
header to help identify documents uniquely.  In particular, when the
server responds to a directory request (e.g. "/foo/") with a default page
("/foo/index.html"), it should emit the new location:

    GET /foo/ HTTP/1.0

    HTTP/1.1 200 Okay
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Location: http://www.apache.org/foo/index.html
    ...

There is no way for the client to infer the true location from
the response otherwise, because it cannot guess whether the
default name is "default.htm", "index.html", "welcome.html", etc.

This information can be very valuable to search engines, scripts
that do indexing, and so on.  Thank you for considering it.

(You could also provide this information when the file is a
local symbolic link to another file within the document tree,
though that would be harder.)

 Emitting Content-Location for / -> /index.html is not desirable at all.
 Neither is emitting it for /foobar -> /foobar.cgi.  Those are not
 just time-saving internal redirects... those are methods of hiding
 implementation of your website.  For example, if you never tack .html onto
 your URLs and you use multiviews everywhere then you can later switch
 selected files to .shtml (SSI), .phtml (mod_php), or .cgi and none of your
 pages will need to be updated to reflect this chance.  None of your users
 will notice the change.
 
 Content-Location is not supported by at least Netscape because of the
 hassles of verifying the validity of the header.  The possibility for
 abuse is large.
 
 So it's unlikely we'll support it.
 
 You however are free to write a module that does it... it shouldn't be too
 hard.  Use a fixup handler and test if r->main != NULL then strcmp
 (r->uri, r->main->uri).  If they're different then a subrequest to a
 different object happened.  But you'll quickly discover that sometimes a
 subrequest does not have a URI.

 I agree that it is not necessary to emit Content-Location for
 new names produced by multiviews or for all subrequests in general.
 
 I'm specifically requesting that Content-Location be given for
 / -> /index.html, because it is by far the most common manner of
 aliasing on the Web that cannot be automatically circumvented, 
 and this header gives us a fairly easy way to fix that.  Reducing
 aliasing is important for any application that wants to associate
 information with remote documents (such as annotations, ratings, etc.).
 
 In such cases /index.html is exposed to the world anyway, so i
 don't think this is in conflict with hiding implementation.
 Content-Location: is supposed to show a variant name to make
 caching work, and my suggestion is an application of the same idea.

 This header is not something that would affect the pages in any
 event, i believe.  No URIs change; this is just a way of providing
 extra information to aid caching and identification.  RFC 2068 says:
 
     In the case where a resource has multiple entities associated
     with it, and those entities actually have separate locations
     by which they might be individually accessed, the server should
     provide a Content-Location for the particular variant which is
     returned. In addition, a server SHOULD provide a Content-Location
     for the resource corresponding to the response entity.
 
 Thanks for taking the time to consider this one.  Let me know if
 this has convinced you at all... :)

 But index.html is really just an artifact of the implementation.  When you
 ask for /foo/ you're asking for the directory object, not the
 /foo/index.html object.  That the two are (sometimes) the same is really
 just an implmentation detail.  That's why I don't agree with doing this. 
 
 If in the unix file system you could have a file and directory with the
 same name then index.html wouldn't be a special case... 
 
 Some sites are "lazy" and refer to directories both by /foo/ and
 /foo/index.html, they would benefit from your proposed feature.  But it
 would hurt sites that deliberately hide these details from the user. 
 
 I think caches using Content-Location would have the same problems with
 reliability that Netscape didn't agree with.  For example, suppose I
 access www.yadda.edu/~studenta/ and it includes Content-Location: 
 http://www.yadda.edu/~studentb/ ... you've successfully poluted a cache.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache may at some future time use Content-Location, but there
does not seem to be any benefit to using it at the moment.  The
main intention of Content-Location was to support browser/editor
applications, so that they would know what URL to attempt to edit.
But there is other work in this area at the moment which may
supercede Content-Location.
