Generally Directives:
---
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>
---

Users' configuration:
---
<Directory /home/*/public_html>
    Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
</Directory>
---

I want apache not making Directory Listings generally 
("Options -Indexes" - not explicitly written)!
But, I want the users to decide in their directories whether a listing is 
to be done or not; by using ".htaccess"!
The Problem is:
I can do 
<Directory /home/*/public_html>
    AllowOverride Options
</Directory>
so the users can put the line 
"Options Indexes" in their .htaccess. 
But then the users also can do a "Options All" 
(Includes,FollowSymLinks,ExecCGI...) - what I really don't want!!

I think it is a design bug!
There should be something like "AllowOverride GenerateIndex"!

Michael
