>Description:
Followup to #2584, July 10 and #2529, June 30.
I noticed that I was getting a similiar logging info in comparision with #2584.  

[Fri Jul 31 10:49:15 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.1 (Unix) configured -- resuming normal operations
[Fri Jul 31 10:49:30 1998] [warn] handler "msql" not found for: /home/httpd/html/test.msql
[Fri Jul 31 10:49:32 1998] [error] File does not exist: /home/httpd/html/yes.html
[Fri Jul 31 10:49:56 1998] [warn] handler "msql" not found for: /home/httpd/html/index.msql
[Fri Jul 31 10:49:57 1998] [error] File does not exist: /home/httpd/html/yes.html

srm.conf includes:
DirectoryIndex index.msql index.html
AddHandler msql .msql
Action msql /cgi-bin/w3-msql

This setup matches another box running Apache 1.2.6 and which doesn't show this log
behavior.

For testing, I changed access.conf:
from
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
to
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

[reference #2529]

No change, as these seemingly "bogus" warnings still appear in the log.

The bogus warnings have been fixed in the next release
after Apache 1.3.9.  See PR 4807.
