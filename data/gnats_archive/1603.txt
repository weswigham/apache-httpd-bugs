Perl v 5.003
>Description:
I can't seem to get any perl scripts to run propperly under apache.  I have run the scripts by themselves using perl and redirected the output to a HTML file which looks fine if I bring it up in netscape.  The CGI that came with the version of apache I compiled work fine, I even have the extra CGI and they work also.  I still just get a 500 though when I try to run any perl script.
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm not always online (usually am), and you have to hack URLs to get to the CGI, but here is how.  I keep a page with my latest address on it at http://www.ovnet.com/~diyab/server.html.  Now once you go there and click on the HTTP://ME!!! link you'll get a URL that looks like http://AM6-X.mountain.net/publicaccess/ where the X is any number from 1 to 49.  once you pull back this page from my system (if I'm online) replace the publicaccess/ part of the URL with /cpus.html. This will take you to a test page for my scripts.  Then just click on the Add to Cart button and you'll get the error.
>Fix:
I think it's either my config or permissions, but I doubt it's the permissions
