>Description:
When I try to access an html page from a servlet using relative path name wrt 
the Apache root I get a FileNotFound Exception, but when I give an absolute
path name it works,i.e it is able to access the page, 
but within the page if I give a relative page access (images etc.) it seems to be
able to access the page, is this a bug? Do I have to do any config setup for
allowing the servlets to access html pages using relative path names?
I have set my zone, repositories etc.
Thanks for suggestions

 As far as I know, there is no concept of relative path names from within
 servlets and hence you get your error.
