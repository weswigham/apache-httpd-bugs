>Environment:
FreeBSD 3.0-CURRENT  --- Last updated 4/18/98
>Description:
While running 1.3b3, I could use Name-Driven virtual hosts, upon upgrading
to 1.3b5, using the same configuration files, I found I couldn't.  I have
re-downloaded and COMPLETELY re-installed apache, only to find it still
does not work.  I have used the new command, "NAMEVIRTUALHOST", and still
it doesn't work.  *.WWW.ENGULF.COM goes to this IP (I am only using ONE ip
for all the servers).  Do I need atleast two IP's?  If someone needs to
see the conf I am using, I will be glad to e-mail them.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can't really repeat it yourself, it isn't a DUMP, just the conf not
working.

State-Changed-Why:

This is a configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.

You are welcome to re-submit your problem report if you
think you found a bug in Apache, but we won't be able
to help you if you don't tell us *what* actually is not
working and provide the relevant parts from your
configuration files.

Thanks for using Apache!
