State-Changed-Why:

Yes, Apache is Y2K compliant.  See the FAQ (which you
should have checked first) where this is answered:
<http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#year2000>

We state very clearly before allowing you to enter a 
PROBLEM REPORT that you should search for answers yourself
first, in various places including the FAQ.  We would
appreciate your assistance by going along with the request.
