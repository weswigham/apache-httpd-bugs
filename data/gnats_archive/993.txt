>Description:
Apache does not show any error message when it is restarted. 
Apache simply dies when there is a corrupt line in a config file with any warning.
After a normal start it shows the warning and dies afterwards :-)

State-Changed-When: Thu Aug 14 06:31:13 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:

Yes, you are right, but that is no bug, because the
output cannot be send to the shell from where someone has
sent a restart signal.
Apache outputs the messages always to the shell from
where it was started.

In one of the next releases we will supply a control script
for starting/stopping/restarting that will check if a
restart succeeded.
