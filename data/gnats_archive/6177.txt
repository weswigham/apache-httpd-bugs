>Description:
When compiling suexec, errors occurred.  Specifically:

1) the compiler was looking for the header file /usr/local/include/apr.h
and could not find it.  My solution was to link /usr/local/include/apr/apr.h
to /usr/local/include/apr.h.

2) the compiler has looking for the file stream stderr and it was an
undefined symbol.  My solution was to add the line '#include <stdio.h>'
to the file suexec.c

3) the compiler was returning errors involving errno.  My solution was to
add the line '#include <errno.h>' to suexec.c

I do not know whether these compilation errors are specific to my distribution,
or whether they are just code errors with the new beta version of apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install the Slackware v7.0 distribution of Linux and try to compile
suexec via the command 'make suexec' from the src/support directory.
>Fix:
See above.

State-Changed-Why:
Suexec has not been re-implemented for Apache 2.0 yet.  There
is an outstanding patch to make suexec work with 2.0, but it
is still being reviewed.  Please look for Suexec functionality
to be added in a future alpha version of 2.0.

Thank you for your bug report.

State-Changed-Why:
Suexec has been implemented in the CVS tree, so this should
work now.  Please try with either the latest CVS or the next
alpha release
