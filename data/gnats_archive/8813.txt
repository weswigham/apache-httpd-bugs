 Actually, this is the system error [outch!]  We shouldn't be sending things
 like 32545 as HTTP response codes, yet we still are [thought that bug was fixed.]

 This request is a _huge_ hint, it looks like the sockets reuse is failing.
 That is, the first request was just fine, the second (kept-alive) was the
