>Environment:
Linux 2.2.13, IBM JDK 1.1.8. Web server is on a different machine from the JServ engine. No authentication, two servlet zones, all logging on.
>Description:
Form fields with the same name with lots of data cause the servlet to return no data. The servlet does nothing but call getParameterNames() and iterates through each and prints each value. When the fields are filled with lots of data, the servlet doesn't return anything. Somewhere around six hundred bytes in a single field, the servlet fails.

I have sniffed the network to see if the data is being transmitted from the web server to the JServ server. It is. No log information is recorded with all logging enabled.

 Please close this bug report. This problem has been discovered to exist in an alternative servlet library. The problem does not
 occur in the Sun JSDK 2.0, but rather in the servlet 2.0 library from http://www.euronet.nl/~pauls/java/servlet and is used in the
 GNUJSP 1.0 implementation.
 
 After replacing the "servlet-2.0" jar from the GNUJSP installation, the problem does not occur. I will report this bug to the
 appropriate people on the GNUJSP team.
