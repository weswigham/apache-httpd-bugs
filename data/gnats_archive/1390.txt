>Environment:
Windows NT4SP3, VC++5, perl 5.00404, mod_perl-1.05
>Description:
To get full functionality from mod_perl, it needs to get access to the basic_http_header routine. This routine is not exported from the DLL. As indicated in the following section, it is needed for mod_perl :

#ifdef WIN32
    croak("Apache->basic_http_header() not supported under Win32!");
#else
    basic_http_header(r);
#endif

Without this, mod_perl does not get thru its selftest.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not easy. Install mod_perl-1.05. Remove the #ifdef Win32 sequence which blocks usage of the routine under Win32. Apply half a dozen patches to the test scripts to see it working. Contact me for more details.
>Fix:
To get to the basic_http_header routine replace the following in /usr/src/apache-1.3b2/src/main/http_protocol.c and /usr/src/apache-1.3b2/src/main/http_protocol.h

<void basic_http_header(request_rec *r)

State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 27 01:30:35 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
basic_http_header should not even be exported from http_protocol.c
let alone be used by a module.  The module would have to implement
large portions of HTTP/1.1 to get things right.  mod_perl should be using
send_http_header().
