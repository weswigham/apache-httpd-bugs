>Environment:
NT4 Workstation SP 3, VC5, Perl 5.004_04
>Description:
After calling 680 times the following script, the server refuses to handle anymore CGI scripts. Another script does the same after 85 times. The error_log reports 

[Sat Dec 06 15:05:42 1997] [error] (24)Too many open files: couldn't spawn child
 process: c:/apache/cgi-bin/odbctest/select2.pl

for each subsequent request. (The "too many open files" message comes from the perl interpreter).

Stopping and restarting the server restores functionality.

No difference was observed between 1.3b2 and 1.3b3, NT WS and NT server, Changing the number of threads, "Apache -s" or "Apache -X".
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run the following scripts 680 times


#!/perl/bin/perl
use CGI;
use Win32::ODBC;

$q = new CGI;
print $q->header;
print $q->start_html("ODBC test");
$db = new Win32::ODBC("NorthWind") unless $db; 
unless ($db) {
	die "Unable to open ODBC : ".Win32::ODBC::Error;
}
print "<H2>Status after opening :</H2>";
print $db->GetError();
print "<BR>ok.<P>";

&Select();
#&Drivers();

undef $db;

print $q->end_html;


sub Select()
{
	print $q->h1("Customers :");
	print "<TABLE>\n";
	$db->Sql("SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName, ContactName, Phone FROM Customers");

	print "<TABLE>\n";
	while ($db->FetchRow()) {
		@_ = $db->Data();
		print "<TR><TD>".join("</TD><TD>",@_)."</TD></TR>";
	}
	print "</TABLE>\n";

}

>Fix:
Nope.
