./configure (empty)
Later I install php... enable the php mod following instructions.
make (all fine)
make install (all fine)
./httpd -f /etc/httpd/bla bla
And then it yells me: Floating Point Exception.

¿? I had installed the previous version of apache.. It worked fine always.
The php config options I use are: --with-mysql --with-apache=../path/ --enable-track-vars --enable-ftp

State-Changed-Why:

It is highly unlikely that this is an Apache problem.
If the server works without PHP compiled in, but not
with PHP, then I suggest you check on the PHP
site to see if you can find an explanation for the
problem.

Thanks for using Apache!

 Greetz,
 
 I realize that this particular bug isn't an apache bug, but I figured I'd
 explain what was happening in case anyone else ran into the same problem.
 The PHP configure script for 4.0.4 p1 seems to mis-detect the presence of
 the SRAND48 function.  The solution is to either manually edit:
 
 main/php_config.h 
 
 and change #define SRAND48 1 to #define SRAND48 0 and then re-make/make
 install PHP, or make sure you get the lastest PHP source from
 snaps.php.net which hopefully has an updated configure.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jason Nugent
