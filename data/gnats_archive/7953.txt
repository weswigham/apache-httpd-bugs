FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE (package from CD-ROM)
>Description:
As soon as I bring up the server, my access log begins filling with accesses to pages NOT on my server -- full URL's such as

207.14.190.121 - - [27/Jun/2001:14:32:10 -0500] "GET http://www.bizarre-top.com/cgi-bin/potop.cgi?action=in&ACC=394 HTTP/1.0" 404 291 "http://www.xxxsexodyssey.com" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98)"

>How-To-Repeat:
Install an unconfigured server and wait for it to be found, I guess!
>Fix:
I'm sure that this has been covered somewhere, but I've searched the FAQ and supporting documentation, and have failed to find it.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jun 29 14:24:29 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

These are just stupid people trying to find open proxy
servers to exploit.  Since all the responses have
status code 404 (file not found), your server is obviously
doing the correct thing and rejecting the requests.
The only thing you can do is contact the ISP of the
clients and complain.

Thanks for using Apache!
