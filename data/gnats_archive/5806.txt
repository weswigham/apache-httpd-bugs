>Description:
Respected sir/Madam,

 As v know there r three types of access restrictions to
 our documents. one of those is htpasswd.
 I created a .htaccess in a protected directory
 it's contents r shown below
  AuthUserFile /home/httpd/html/surya/.htpasswd
AuthName Surya
AuthType Basic
<Limit GET POST>
require user anand
</Limit>
--------
 then i used htpasswd pgm
 htpasswd -c .htpasswd anand
 it asked for password & password file
 was created succesfully.
 Now when i access some file in protected
  directory it's not asking user name & passwd
   it just allows anyone 2 access files in those directory.
  will u please help me out reg this problem
   thanx in advance
        truly
           rajni

State-Changed-Why:
1) What specific version of Apache are you using (e.g.,
   1.3.9, 1.3.12, ...)?  If you are using anything older
   than 1.3.12, please upgrade and try this again.
2) Try removing the <Limit> and </Limit> directives.
