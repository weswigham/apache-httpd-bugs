>Description:
I am using the Oracle/Apache webserver for a document archiving application that uses PL*SQL to write back DHTML to the users browser.
The user may download a document directly into the browser (using mime types).  Previously a cgi download program (written in C) was used but now it is all handled through PL*SQL.  However as the URL reference to the cgi program is included in documents and other external references we used the following mod_rewrite to redirect the cgi reference to the new PL*SQL download procedure.

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/dms/download?webid+(.*)$ /pls/dms1/download?webid=$1

This works fine but if the downloaded document is a html document any referenced images (or other documents) (that require the above mapping rule) are not loaded into the displayed html page.  Using the browser view souce the references contain the premapped reference.

This is the first time I've worked on a web application but I guess:
when the Apache server sends back a page it looks into the page then it can send back any referenced documents that are on the current site with the main page.  When this happens it doesn't send the references through mod_rewrite so in this case it sends a "document doesn't exist" flag.

State-Changed-Why:
The browser is the one that requests the images.  You either need to have the server send a redirect (instead of just an internal rewrite) so the client knows how to resolve the relative URLs properly, or you have to add more rewrite rules so when the browser requests the images the requests will be rewritten to where they really are.

Apache does not parse the HTML or send the images, the client parses the HTML and requests the images.

 Hi Marc,
 
 Thanks for the information but now I'm really confused.  From your response
 I gather the following happens:
 
 1)  My browser requests a document.
 2)  The server remaps the URL.
 3)  The server returns the document.
 4)  My browser parses the document and comes across a reference to an image
 which it requests.
 5)  This time the server does not remap the URL so the image is not
 returned.
 
 The URL request format is the same in both cases.  From your mail it sounds
 like they are separate requests from the browser so why does the first work
 and the second fail?
 
 I have been looking on the web for information on browser/server
 communication and more specific details about their internal workings but
 haven't found anything yet.  If you know of any references I would happy if
 you could forward them so I can work out what's going on.
 
 
 Cheers,
 
 Dave

 Then obviously the "request format" isn't the same.  Figure out what URL
 your browser is trying to use to load the image that isn't working.  Then
 figure out why your rewrite rules aren't applying to that URL, and fix
 them so they do.  I'm afraid we really can't help explain how the web
 works here, this forum is for bug reports and we do not have the resources
 to tutor people.
