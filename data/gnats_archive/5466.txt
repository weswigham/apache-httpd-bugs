>Description:
I have a cgi-script that sends the location-verb
"Location: http://name.dom.se/cgi-bin/script.cgi?some_variables"
when the client-browser is a Microsoft Internet Explorer 4. or 5.
Requesting SERVER_PROTOCOL= HTTP/1.1 
all my apache child processes dies, and becomes restarted by the apache-father
process who do not die.

An strace of the father-process looks like this

>How-To-Repeat:
Here are two sampe cgi-scripts that can reproduce the problem.

############## one.cgi
#!/bin/ksh

# disable filename globbing
set -f

echo "Location: http://name.dom.se/cgi-bin/two.cgi?\c"
echo "A=23456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678&\c"

# The following two lines in httpd.conf makes the problem dissaper
