how about add to include directive possiblities for specify mask of files?

include virtualhosts/*.conf

in this case I can add virtual server just by put file in virtualhosts
and reload config by apachectl graceful

how about this?

State-Changed-Why:

I'm marking this for future consideration, although I don't
think it is likely to be popular; wildcards are too
dangerous.  All it would take is a single file that
doesn't contain directives -- such as a log file -- to
appear in the directory and the server becomes unstartable.
However, we'll consider it more carefully later.  Thanks
for the suggestion.
