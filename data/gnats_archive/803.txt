>Description:

Multiple /'s in a URL..

e.g. http://host///file.html

Discovered when another server did a redirect to ours. I've checked a number
of apache powered sites and the same occurs (i.e. allows it through). Causes
wierd log entries, and a few errors for accessing users. Doesn't appear
to affect our CGI stuff yet, but we're still checking.
>How-To-Repeat:

e.g. http://www.apache.org///dist.html
>Fix:
Looks like the URL parsing isn't being strict after the http://

Yes, that is the way Apache behaves, but what is the problem
with it?  It is the same behavior as most Unix filesystems
exhibit.

 Well, that forced me to go look at the definition again,
 and from the BNF description, /// can occur
 (http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/5_BNF.html). Compliance
 means no bug.
 
 The apache server is relying on the underlying file system
 which may not act the same way on every system, thus possible
 inconsistencies. Other servers such as Netscape don't allow
 multiple /'s in the path (probably to remove the possible
 inconsistency.) Maybe the apache behavior (even if it's
 compliant) should be pointed out in the documents.
 
 Mike.

State-Changed-Why:
Decided this isn't against any spec, but it is arguable that Apache
shouldn't act this way.  Some servers do (eg. IIS), some
don't (eg. Netscape's servers).

May be changed in the future if we add an abstraction
layer to take away the dependency on the filesystem.
