>Description:
i have left the default home directory call as public_html
so if i type ~username
it should reference
/home/username/public_html
One problem.. i'm under 95 where there isn't a /home and i don't know how to fix this
i have tried making /home/username/public_html on all my drives but it ceases to work
I think this may just be a bug
>How-To-Repeat:
Seems obvious... just try this under win95
>Fix:
In config file have a field to locate the top level home dir like
e:/users/
then every time a ~username request was filed it would look at
e:/users/username/public_html/

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr  7 06:45:51 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
UserDirs in the form "UserDir foo" do not function on
Win32 because they rely on the concept of a user home
directory supported by the OS.  Please read the
mod_userdir docs for other forms that can be used
on Win32.
