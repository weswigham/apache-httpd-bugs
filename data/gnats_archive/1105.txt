State-Changed-Why:

The bug was tracked in PR#1024 and
is already fixed in the current 1.3 source tree.

>Unformatted:
>>ProxyRemote https  https://proxy1.domain:8080

Brings Up an Error Messsage (Netscape):
    "Netscape cannot find the server '...'.
     Server has no DNS entry."

The https request is doing fine, if I'm accessing the remote proxy (firewall)
directly from my netscape browser.

Is this Bug related to #PR173? (using port 443 doesn't work either)
