Compiling from command line using NMAKE
>Description:
I am building and installing Apache on Windows from the command line using NMAKE (not the IDE).  The current directory is src/.  I have successfully built Apache using "nmake /f Makefile.win _apacher" and am trying to execute

nmake /f Makefile.win installr INSTDIR="E:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache"

The build fails on the following line in the makefile:

awk -f <<script2.awk "support\apxs.pl" $(INSTDIR) >"$(INSTDIR)\bin\apxs.pl"

The failure occurs because $(INSTDIR) contains embedded spaces, but the macro preceding the redirection is not quoted.  By adding quotation marks, the build finishes successfully:

awk -f <<script2.awk "support\apxs.pl" "$(INSTDIR)" >"$(INSTDIR)\bin\apxs.pl"
>How-To-Repeat:
Build from the command line and install into a directory that contains embedded spaces.
>Fix:
Yes.  Add quotation marks around the $(INSTDIR) macro on the following line in src/makefile.win:

Bad:  awk -f <<script2.awk "support\apxs.pl" $(INSTDIR) >"$(INSTDIR)\bin\apxs.pl"

Fix:  awk -f <<script2.awk "support\apxs.pl" "$(INSTDIR)" >"$(INSTDIR)\bin\apxs.pl"
