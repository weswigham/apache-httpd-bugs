State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
