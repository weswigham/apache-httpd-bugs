>Environment:
NetBSD 1.3.3 x86 with gcc 2.7.2
Simple Apache 1.3.9 using suexec without any additional modules
>Description:
By compiling Apache 1.3.9 on NetBSD/1.3.3 x86 with gcc 2.7.2, it does not seem to read the README files anymore when parsing http://www.server.com/~user/dir/.

Using the same compilation directives and the same config file, Apache 1.3.6 works correctly.

So, when I switch back to 1.3.6, I can access them. You (www.apache.org) seem to run Apache 1.3.8-dev and do not face this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.epita.fr/~cahagn_o/test2

There's a README file that's not read by 1.3.9 whereas it is with 1.3.6 (again using the same httpd.conf and same compil directive).
>Fix:
Nope. Sorry. I didn't look at the Apache source code.
