I'm using the apache_1.3.22-win32-no_src.msi to install the application
>Description:
I am installing version 1.3.22 (as a service) on my Windows 2000 box and the last screen of the installer throws displays: 

"Warning: The TCP/IP networking protocol ro the WinSock2 update were not successfully detected on this PC.  Until the problem is corrected, Apache installation cannot continue reliably.  Assure TCP/IP networking is configured correctly.  Windows 95 users must install the Winsock 2...." etc.

This would make sense if I was running Win95, because the documentation on requirements is extensive.  I have reinstalled TCP/IP to make sure there was nothing wrong with that.  I have checked the version number of the Winsock2 dll... everything is fine there.  I use valid network names when requested at the second screen of the installer.  In fact, I have tried every possible combination of network names to see if one set of values is the "one" the installer needs.  I have also made sure that I have installed Windows Installer 2.0.

If I ignore the error, Apache will not install correctly as a service, although it can be launched from the start menu.  If I go back and don't install as a service, I still receive this error.

This is NOT a problem I encountered in version 1.3.20.  That installs as a service just fine on my PC using the same configuration information requested by the installer.  It is a very smooth install.

I have tested only on two other similarly configured (exact same OS and hardware) machines, with no errors one one, and errors on the other.  

What kinds of things will cause the installer to throw this message and not complete the install? If I can find that out, I can probably troubleshoot and resolve.  Is there a possible registry setting that the installer looks at that I need to delete?
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the installer on a Windows 2000 professional machine with Service Pack 2?  That might or might not work.
