HP-UX hpinteg2 B.10.20 U 9000/800 2011705904 unlimited-user license
>Description:
I was trying to install php4 
I configured php using the following line:
./configure --with-apxs=/opt/apache/bin/apxs --prefix=/opt/php4 --without-mysql

make works fine but in make install, apxs complains that
libs/libphp4.sl is not a DSO

I edited apxs and had to change line
if ($f !~ m|.so$|) {

to 
if ($f !~ m|.sl$|) {

The fact is that shared library files under HP-UX are ".sl" files.
