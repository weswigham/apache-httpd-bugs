diff conf.h conf.h.old

You man also change the compiler flag '-O2' to '-fast -xO4' for SPARCcompiler

State-Changed-Why:
That can fix the problem, but I think the cause is the
getwd() define in the SOLARIS2 section in conf.h.  From
what I have heard, that messes up some macros that Solaris
defines which causes the error.

The fix would seem to be to not define getwd() for 
Solaris, but older versions may need it; I am unsure.  It
will be checked.

Unfortunately, we don't have anyone with a 2.6 machine to
test things on...

State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 21 11:53:00 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Should be fixed with some changes made that will be 
available in the next beta in the next few days.  If you
get a chance, please try 1.2b7 when out and let us know if
it still gives problems.
