State-Changed-Why:
Read what the error says.  You are trying to send an
ErrorDocument that is protected by authentication
so of course it can't be sent.

You need to make your authentication restriction so
it doesn't apply to the errordocument.

You can either move everything else to a seperate subtree
and only restrict that, or remove the restrictions from
the error document, eg.

<Location /error/>
allow from all
Satsify any
</Location>

There are many different ways to do this.

 Erm... that should be "satisfy" of course.
