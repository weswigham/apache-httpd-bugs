Netscape 4.04
MSIE 4.01
>Description:
Netscape correctly displays .htm files from ServerRoot
but shows them as text when they are retrived from UserDir.

Even tried AddType in directory section access.conf. Telnet
to port 80 show same header info (except of course for ETag
and Last-Modified) for test.htm and test.html.

Installing 1.2.6 produced same results. Dont have any old
browsers around to test further. Old user directory server
was apache 1.0.5 on SCO OS5 which did not show this problem...

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid I don't understand.  You say Netscape doesn't
display them properly from ~userdir directories but
then you say the fix is to nuke Microsoft?

Do you mean IE doesn't display them properly or what?

I'm afraid that we really can't help you though, since Apache
is clearly sending the correct information and there is
nothing we can do to make the client act differently
if it is broken.  I would suggest that you need to be
sure you clear your cache in your browser and try reloading
it.

If that fails, you need to contact the browser vendor to
see what is wrong.  I can't reproduce it here.

 You have to clear the memory and disk caches to force netscape to re-read
 a content-type.  So if you accidentally sent it text/plain once it'll
 think it's text/plain for eternity.
