>How-To-Repeat:

Page <http://www.djvuzone.org/links/index.html>
contains links to several sites using DjVu.
About 50% of them  do not serve the data with
the proper mime type.  Many web site authors only check 
with MSIE and do not realize the problem since MSIE rely 
mostly on the file extensions instead of the mime type.

We address the problem by registering a vnd mime type,
including support for this new mime type in the
djvulibre plugins, lobbying Lizardtech to do the same
in their commercial plugins, and asking the apache 
group to include this mime type into your future 
distributions.
>Fix:
Add the following line to   conf/mime.types :

image/vnd.djvu		djvu djv
