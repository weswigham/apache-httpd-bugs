Linux lobos 2.0.29 #2 Sat Mar 15 22:10:23 PST 1997 i586
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
According to the docs, "The User directive sets the userid as which the
server will answer requests."  I have a virtual server with the following
configuration:

<VirtualHost 206.40.79.20>
ServerName www.ender.org
User hudson
ServerAdmin webmaster@ender.org
DocumentRoot /www/docs/www.ender.org
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /www/cgi-bin/hudson/
TransferLog logs/www.ender.org
</VirtualHost>

The server still uses the www:www user:gid for reading the files in
DocumentRoot; that is, if I have a file owned by me (hudson) with
permissions 0600, access to the file returns a 403.  Access to a file
owned by user "www" with the same permissions will work.  Execution of
CGI scripts using suexec does execute with the correct user (hudson).
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.ender.org/ has two files on it, both with permissions 0600.
"hudson" is owned by me, and "www" is owned by user www, the user the
server normally runs at.
http://www.ender.org/cgi-bin/printinfo will show the UID/GID it executes
as on the bottom.  I am UID 1000, user "www" is UID 500.  This seems to
be correct.

>Fix:
Does the "User" directive in a <VirtualHost> only affect execution
of CGI scripts?  If so, the documentation should be changed to reflect
this.%0

State-Changed-Why:
As you surmise, the User directive in VirtualHosts only
affects the user CGIs run as.  Documentation has 
been updated.
