State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Jul 14 20:32:02 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
No, we can not.  Making binaries for zillions of platforms
is done only on an as-available basis and really cuts
into development time.

You can download and install gcc for free and use it to
compile Apache.
