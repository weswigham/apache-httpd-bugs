>Description:
If the status for a http request is on a file and that file has not changed
a return code is given HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED. If HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED is the return
code. Only specific http headers are returned from the function:
ap_send_error_response. If a module inserts a Cookie by adding a Set-Cookie
header to the request struct "r->headers_out" this will be ignored by
the ap_send_error_response. Only the following headers are returned:

                    "Connection",
                    "Keep-Alive",
                    "ETag",
                    "Content-Location",
                    "Expires",
                    "Set-Cookie",
                    "Cache-Control",
                    "Vary",
                    "Warning",
                    "WWW-Authenticate",
                    "Proxy-Authenticate",

insert a cookie from a module like usertrack and if the file 
>Fix:
This can be changed by addint "Set-Cookie" to the list of allowed headers in
the function ap_send_error_response.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a duplicate of GNATS pr 8970.

It is not valid to send Set-Cookie for a 304 response.

See old GNATS pr 8970 for slightly more info.
