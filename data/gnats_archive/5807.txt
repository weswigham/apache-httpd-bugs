 I tried with WinNT Workstation 4.0 and it works ok, but on Win95 it does not:
 I tested on several computers both Apache 1.3.11 and Apache 1.3.9.
 
 I tried to load any other module (anon_auth_module, cern_meta_module, and
 so on) and they all work right, so I think it is not a matter of path: the
 problem is only with the proxy module.
 
 Thank you for your help, best regards
