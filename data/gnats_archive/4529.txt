>Description:

I am not getting the output from my Perl 5.04.02 DBI:ODBC statements with NT as a service, vs. as a conosle app

>How-To-Repeat:
I have a Perl 5.04.02 DBI:ODBC script which will run under console App, but not under NT as a service.  Here are the critical elements:

#(After setting up ODBC Service:)
use CGI;
use DBI::W32ODBC;
$qs="SELECT DISTINCT PartType FROM PARTS WHERE Classification='$FORM{'class'}';";

$dbHandle = (DBI->connect('PartsDB-I', '', '', { RaiseError => 1 }));
print $dbHandle->errstr . "\n";
$sth = $dbHandle->prepare("$qs");
$rc = $sth->execute;
$row_ary = $sth->fetch;
$rc = $sth->execute;
@row_ary = $sth->fetchrow;
print "@row_ary[0]";
>Fix:
WORKAROUND - You can start Apache Console app, even if it is already running as a service.  Maybe it could be put into the NT startup scripts.

(Could this have anything to do with different privs as a service?)

It sounds like a problem with DBI::ODBC or with the perl you're using. Your report doesn't really provide anything to work on for us.

Please report again if you get more information.

 We think that this may be the priviledges that I DON'T have as a service, that I
 DO have as an individual.
 
 It may be a useful gotcha tip to include for running as a Service vs. running as
 a concole app.
