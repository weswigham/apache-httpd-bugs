>Description:
Hopefully there is a simple answer to this simple problem.  I have a directory that contains an index.html file.  I have set the server to use index.html files on initial directory access:

<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.jsp default.jsp
</IfModule>

I have created two identical aliases:

    Alias /pictures  "D:/Pictures"
    Alias /pict      "D:/Pictures"

The second one brings up the index.html file, but the first one brings up a directory listing.

I have cleared my browser's cache.  I have tried this from another system.  I have restarted the server.  I have rebooted the server system.  Nothing seems to make the first one recognize the index.html file.  Very strange.

I figure there must be a server cache somewhere, but I can't find it.  If one does exist, please point me to it and tell me how to clear it.  If not, please tell me what else I may be doing wrong.

Thank you!

>How-To-Repeat:
Yes.  

http://abraham.cs.uml.edu/pictures will give you a directory listing.  Click on index.html and you'll see what you're supposed to see instead.

http://abraham.cs.uml.edu/pict will bring up the index.html file.
>Fix:
All I can think of is that there must be a cache somewhere, as mentioned above.  Any help you can send would certainly be appreciated!

Thank you,
Jesse

State-Changed-When: Tue May  1 11:25:37 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The page at the given /pictures/ url is NOT the format of an Apache directory listing, so it must be generated by some other piece of software.  Let me guess... you have jrun installed and configured to handle requests to /pictures/

In any case, you have some other module setup to handle requests for /pictures/ and we have no control over what it does WRT displaying indexes itself.

 Answer found!  After trying all kinds of things with the Apache server, I
 thought that perhaps the problem is with JRun, which was connected to the
 Apache server.  Sure enough, I had to delete some things in JRun to avoid
 conflicts and now everything works as it should.  Sorry to have bothered
 anyone, but this has stumped me all day!
