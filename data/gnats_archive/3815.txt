This sounds like a windows TCP bug.

State-Changed-Why:
How are you starting the server after the change? (What command are you using?).
If you start Apache from the command line using 'apache', the server will not come up for
several seconds (it is querying the service manager, which is unnecessary if apache is 
run from the command line). If you try with 'apache -s', you will not see this
delay in starting. Could this be the problem you are seeing?
it comes up immediately. -s tells the 
server not to try to query the service manager

 Dear sir:
 
   Sorry, My earlier post is not really right.
 
   After few days watch, I found the reason is because my site is too busy.   
 
   Now my Apache setting is like:
   -------------------------
   KeepAlive Off
   MaxKeepAliveRequests 0
   KeepAliveTimeout 20
   MaxRequestsPerChild 0
   ThreadsPerChild 256
   -------------------------
 
   And I use http://mysitename/server-staus to check it, screen show:
 
   130 requests currently being processed, 126 idle servers
 
   So, When I switch to "KeepAlive On", the "MaxKeepAliveRequests" is not enough.
   (I think maybe 300~800 users online, if keep-alive)
    
   I don't understand why Apache server never tell me "too busy", Apache just 
   delay each web-page "first" 3~4 seconds.  (sometimes 10~15 seconds)
 
   So, I disable KeepAlive now.
 
   However I hope user can keep-alive, But I found Apache's Windows version just support
   max 256 users keep-alive.  it's too small for me.
 
   And I found the only way to expand this number is "modify the source, re-compiler it"
   but it's too hard for me...
 
   I hope the future version's apache can expand this limit.
 
   There is also a small problem.
 
   "Apache -k restart"  can restart apache.  but not immediately.
   If I send this command at PM23:30, the Apache will restart at AM1:00 ~ AM2:00
   It's really too late.
 
   Thanks for your reply , and sorry for my broken english.
 
 Lee-1

State-Changed-Why:
Lee,
Thanks for the additional info. Now I understand what is happening. Apache on Win32 will accept all connections and queue them for the worker thread pool. The queue size is unbounded (not good. I'll try to fix this in the next release). 

What you are seeing is hundreds of connections being accepted and queued, but all 250 worker threads are blocked on persistent connections, blocked waiting to receive requests from clients.  If a thread is blocked waiting on data from the client, it is not available to service new connections on the queue. 

Here are a tuning tip...
You need to balance the settings of ThreadsPerChild with the KeepAliveTimeout.  First, I'd decrease KeepAliveTimeout, to perhaps 10 or maybe 5 seconds. If you still see problems, try increasing ThreadsPerChild. You should favor decreasing KeepAliveTimeout over increasing ThreadsPerChild.

State-Changed-Why:
I just checked in changes to:
1. Honor restart and shutdown, even if it means loosing 
connections in the TCP stack's listen queue. Restart 
triggered by MaxRequestsPerChild will wait until the server
is not busy before restarting the child process

2. Increase HARD_SERVER_LIMIT on Win32 to 1500

Thee changes should be available with Apache 1.3.7. I
