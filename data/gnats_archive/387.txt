>Description:
contents of /usr/include/sys/uio.h included by buff.c follows:

---- begin ----
dusty:/usr/include/sys# cat uio.h
/* Copyright (C) 1991, 1992 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This file is part of the GNU C Library. ....... etc. */
#ifndef _SYS_UIO_H

#define _SYS_UIO_H      1
#include <features.h>

__BEGIN_DECLS

#define __need_size_t
#include <stddef.h>


/* Structure describing a section of memory.  */

struct iovec
{
  /* Starting address.  */
  __ptr_t iov_base;
  /* Length in bytes.  */
  size_t iov_len;
};


/* Read data from file descriptor FD, and put the result in the
   buffers described by VECTOR, which is a vector of COUNT `struct iovec's.
   The buffers are filled in the order specified.
   Operates just like `read' (see <unistd.h>) except that data are
   put in VECTOR instead of a contiguous buffer.  */
int readv __P ((int __fd, __const struct iovec * __vector, size_t __count));

/* Write data pointed by the buffers described by VECTOR, which
   is a vector of COUNT `struct iovec's, to file descriptor FD.
   The data is written in the order specified.
   Operates just like `write' (see <unistd.h>) except that the data
   are taken from VECTOR instead of a contiguous buffer.  */
int writev __P ((int __fd, __const struct iovec * __vector, size_t __count));


__END_DECLS

#endif /* sys/uio.h */
----- end ----

Since compile error was:

--- begin ---
[snip]
gcc -c -Iregex  -O2 -DLINUX -DSTATUS   buff.c
In file included from buff.c:66:
/usr/include/sys/uio.h:33: redefinition of `struct iovec'
make: *** [buff.o] Error 1
--- end ---

I rem'd the include at line 66 of buff.c - as per:

#ifndef NO_WRITEV
#include <sys/types.h>
/*
#include <sys/uio.h>
*/
#endif

since struct iovec is defined at line 644 of buff.c

I'm not competent at C, but it looked like a possibility to me, the
compile then ran ok to end, and httpd 'appeared' to work... however
I did not leave it in service since I was not sure of the consequences.

>How-To-Repeat:
easy to repeat using code of 1.2b8 and uio.h given above
>Fix:
suspect that /usr/include/sys/uio.h may be obsolete code..%3
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Mon Apr 14 07:23:17 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
buff.c is NOT redefining iovec, just declaring a variable
of that type.  Allan Cox says:

>Unformatted:
>You are using an old C library include set and a newer kernel. If you
>remove the definition of struct iovec from your includes, or you use
>a set of includes appropriate for a 2.0 kernel you will not have this
>problem.
