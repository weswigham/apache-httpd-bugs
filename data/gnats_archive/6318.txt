>Description:
I have a patch for this, so you do not need to study the traceback too
carefully.  ap_read_config does not set parms.err_directive, but this
field is derefenced by the routine that prints error messages relating to
any syntax errors found.  So, instead, if apache core dumps when it tries
to print the error message.

>How-To-Repeat:
Retrieve ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/adam/for_apache/httpd.conf.broken
into a local file and run "httpd -f" on it.
>Fix:
Yes.  Here is a suggested patch.  Warning: all I did was stuff the undefined
field with the only value that I saw laying around that was of the same
data type.  I do not know if, for example, the line numbers in the resulting
error message are correct.

State-Changed-By: abagchi
State-Changed-When: Mon Jul 17 09:20:50 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
This problem is due to the ClearModuleList/AddModule directives
in your config file.  If those are removed, this config file
will not cause a seg fault.

We are currently discussing if those directives are really
necessary in 2.0 or not.

State-Changed-When: Mon Jul 24 22:33:21 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
ClearModuleList and AddModule were both set as EXEC_ON_READ
and they don't need to be.  Because these were set as
EXEC_ON_READ the server was seg faulting.  I have removed
the EXEC_ON_READ definition, and tested this on my server.
It seems to have worked.  These changes should be in the
next alpha version of Apache 2.0.  Please try them, and let
us know if this solves your problem.

Thank you for your bug report, and I'm sorry it took so long
to fix this problem.
