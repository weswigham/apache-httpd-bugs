BSD/OS 4.x, but most BSD's probably affected.
>Description:
The Apache Makefile depends on a "make" that supports the SysV include directive.
This causes people to complain, over and over, that "make is broken" because they are
trying to use Berkeley make.

It would be nice if the Makefile didn't depend on this feature, or if the documentation
made it really abundantly clear that GNU make or SysV make is required.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile on a system with BSD make.
>Fix:
I would tend to not use includes at all, since they aren't a portable or standard
feature.  Most of the "desired effects" can be obtained by using environment variables,
or by building the makefile from component parts.
