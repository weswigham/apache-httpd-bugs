State-Changed-Why:
Please give a gdb backtrace from the coredump.  I'm 90%
sure this is a known problem in ap_get_local_host() where 
a DNS lookup fails but we segfault dereferencing the return 
value from gethostbyname().

See this patch to ap_get_local_host() if you're interested:

http://www.apache.org/websrc/viewcvs.cgi/apache-1.3/src/main/util.c.diff?r1=1.194&r2=1.195

To get a gdb backtrace:

  gdb /path/to/httpd /path/to/httpd.core
  bt

Thanks!

State-Changed-Why:
The requested feedback was never received, but it is safe
to state that this is the oft-seen 1.3.19 bug in
ap_get_local_host() which is fixed in CVS and will be
fixed in the next release of Apache 1.3.x.
