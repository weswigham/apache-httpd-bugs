>Description:
Excerpt from error_log file 
httpd: [Thu Jan 28 11:09:56 1999] [notice] child pid 337 exit signal User Signal 2 (17)
httpd: [Thu Jan 28 11:09:56 1999] [notice] child pid 336 exit signal User Signal 2 (17)

We are not running this over nfs, or doing dns lookups.
The server is plain vanilla out of the tar file compile.

There does not appear to be a pattern to when it suddenly has these problems.  

The only other information in the error_log file is the following, our users
are not always patient enough to let the program finish: 
httpd: [Thu Jan 28 08:45:44 1999] [error] [client 164.76.107.174] Premature end 
of script headers: /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Swebrecon

>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot repeat the problem on demand, it happens when it does.
>Fix:
Not a clue.

State-Changed-Why:
Nothing in apache sends SIGUSR2.

Can you truss the parent when it's not forking?  That
would provide useful info.
