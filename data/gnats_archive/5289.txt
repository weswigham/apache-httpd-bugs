http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#ssi-part-i

Processing a document at run-time is called parsing it; hence the term 
"parsed HTML" sometimes used for documents that contain SSI instructions. 
Parsing tends to be extremely resource-consumptive...

This has been true with 1.1 version of Apache, but running a server that is 
doing several millions includes a day, I would rather leave word 'extremely"
out of that sentence, it simply is not true any more.

http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#footer

You can make arbitrary changes to static documents by configuring an Action 
which launches a CGI script. The CGI is then responsible for setting a 
content-type and delivering the requested document (the location of which is 
passed in the PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable), along with whatever 
footer is needed. 

Combined with above information about SSI being _extremely_ resource-
consumptive, one may think that using CGI or PHP this way would need less
resources, which of course is not the case.
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A
>Fix:
Take away the word extremely from resource-consumption in SSI part, and add 
warning about resources when using CGI to add footers (etc).
