bug report system should return form with already entered information if some fields are missing.
I tried to report bug. Because it was not related to any OS, I left Environment 
field blank (where it is said that this field is mandatory?). Bug report system 
complained about empty field. Pressing back showed me empty fields. I had to 
reenter evrything again :-( Not sure I will act this way next time :-|
>How-To-Repeat:
See above
>Fix:
In case of empty required fields show form with text already entered and comment what is still missing.

What the form fields contain when you click your browser's
Back button is up to the browser, not the remote site
which isn't consulted.
