I'm using perl, version 5.003_93

>Description:
I upgraded to new version of apache from
1.2b6 to 1.2b8 on my Linux 2.0.27 system.

This morning the server was out of memory, and I
found a lot of unterminated requests.

From apache status info there was a lot of servers
in "mode of operation = W".

I restarted the servers, and all memory was released
servers started and all was looking god.

Then I started a Perl CGI from my browser making some
200Kb output, and was pressing STOP from the browser.

The "apache status info" was again showing me that the
server was in  "mode of operation = W" - But then after
10 minutes - the server was still there in same mod., and
the Perl CGI still loaded.

My httpd.conf have Timeout set to 120.

Is it not so that this timeout supposed to kill the server
after 120 sec in my case ??

I did not have this problem in 1.2b6

 Can you try editing conf.h, search for LINUX and remove the "#define
 HAVE_SHMGET", then "make clean; make". 
 
 Are you running multiple apaches on this machine? 
 
 Could you try 1.2b7 if the first thing doesn't work?  That'll just narrow
 down our search.
 
 Thanks
