>Environment:
The Apache server is running at my ISP's web site, so I don't have access to all this info; sorry.   It doesn't related to my report, in any event (really!)
>Description:
I've looked hard, searched www.apache.org, etc, and just can't find a list of all the error messages you can get in the server's error log, and their exact meanings.   Some are obvious, but others are not, and we don't know whether to be concerned about them or not....

If I've missed this list, please forgive me and give me a pointer to how to obtain it!   I sure TRIED hard to find it....

State-Changed-Why:

I'm afraid there is no such list.

There are always added new and different log message while
others are removed... maintaing a list with all log messages
and a description is more or less impossible.

With version 1.3 all error log entries are logged with
a syslog-like category, eg. notice, error, warning to
give people an idea about the importance of a specific
log entry.

On the other hand most log messages are self explanatory
(at least the important onces)...
