SunOS shade.twinsun.com 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
suexec assumes that tm_year is the year modulo 100, but it's actually
the year - 1900.  This will cause suexec to generate bogus logs after 1999.

While we're on the subject, dates like `01-02-03' are confusing and ambiguous.
It's better to use ISO 8601 format dates like `2003-01-02'.
Also, put the date first, so that timestamps sort correctly.

State-Changed-Why:
Yup this is a bug, but it'd be preferable for suexec to
use one of the date formats already in use ... like the
one in error_log or common log format (both are lame).
