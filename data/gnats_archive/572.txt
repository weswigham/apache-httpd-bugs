State-Changed-Why:
Apache does not support OnDeny. However it does support thesame functionality using the much more general ErrorDocumentdirectory. For example, to redirect on authenticationfailure, use  ErrorDocument 401 urlor to redirect on remote address failure, use  ErrorDocument 403 urlThe "url" can be a full URL, a local URL or a string(starting with a ").Let us know if this does not provide all the functionalityyou need.

State-Changed-Why:
Note to corrrect above: With ErrorDocument 401 the urlcannot be a full URL - it must be a local URL or string.
