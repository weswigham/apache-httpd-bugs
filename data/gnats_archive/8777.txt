>Description:
I'm working ofr a firm that want to hide the web server platform that
they are using.

By default Apache volunteers the product name, version, platform, and 
installed modules (ServerTokens = Full).

Shouldn't there be a ServerTokens = None option for paranoid sites?
>How-To-Repeat:
(See default setting for ServerTokens)
>Fix:
ServerTokens = None to suppress the header message containing the header 
message containing server tokens.
