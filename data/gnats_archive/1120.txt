SunOS hurricane 5.5.1 Generic_103640-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1, GCC 2.7.2
>Description:
A passing arguments to #exec cmd works fine when not using suEXEC,
but suEXEC dies on this when trying to execute the command.
>How-To-Repeat:
<!--#exec cmd="blah.pl blah=foo"--> used to pass "blah=foo" on the
command line. suEXEC dies on this since it cannot lstat the whole
string.
>Fix:
Change suEXEC to break "cmd" out into a command, and arguments to it.

State-Changed-Why:

Sorry about the delayed response.

This looks good to me, except that it doesn't account for
filenames with spaces in it; think about Win32, or more
realistically, think about Unix-mounted filesystems that
are also exported to other OS's where spaces in file and
directory names are much more common.  

We're in feature freeze for 1.3.0 right now, but this is
on our docket for 1.3.1.  Please keep the patch around,
and if you improve it to handle spaces so much the better.

 i hope i've got the format right for appending to an existing PR; i
 couldn't find any docs on that subject.
 
 anyway: i was curious about the status of this PR, because although
 the PR says it was scheduled to be fixed in 1.3.1, it doesn't seem to
 be fixed as recently as 1.3.3.
 
 a closely related question:  i could not figure out for the life of me 
 how suexec is supposed to know when to pass its arguments to the
 shell.  as described in this PR, suexec prints an error message that
 indicates that it tried to run lstat on the entire command line that
 it was called for.  however, our logs show that that command is not
 prefixed with /bin/sh.  it would seem that suexec is supposed to infer 
 this, but i certainly do not see any code to do that.  am i missing
 it?

[Text sent to the DB incorrectly.]

The argument about filenames with spaces doesn't really apply,  those
spaces would have to be escaped to be handled properly by the shell (if
suexec was off).  The patch would only have to handle escaped spaces.

This brings up an interesting point.  If #exec is parsed by the shell
without suexec it needs to be parsed just the same way with suexec.  This
is especially true since non ~userdir cgis under virtualhosts (or main
servers) without User/Group directives will not run through suexec.
