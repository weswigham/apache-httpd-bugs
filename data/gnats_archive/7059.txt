Linux klon 2.0.36 #7 Wed Nov 1 13:27:30 CET 2000 i686 unknown
>Description:
configuration:
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
ServerName testserver
ServerAlias test
DocumentRoot /home/httpd/test
</VirtualHost>

/home/httpd/test/.htaccess (basic auth)

So when i typed http://test/ i had to authorise twice
(once for test, once for testserver) and then i was
redirected to http://testserver/
why?
>How-To-Repeat:
I think single authorisation sould be enough.
Then, I would like to see http://test/ again (not beeing redirected
to $SERVER_NAME)
>Fix:
I am not a programmer :(
