Sorry, if you won't tell us what is wrong we can't help you.

"crashes" doesn't say much.  I think it is a bit much for you
to say it won't work on Win98 at all, when many people have it
working without problem.

Most likely you need to try running it from the command line
and look in the error log and take note of any messages it
gives.

Since you don't appear interested in resolving the problem,
there isn't much we can do...

 You don't have to be a programmer, but you do have to be able to read and
 follow instructions.  I have already told you what you have to do; I can't
 help any more than that.

 Read the manual.
 
 It quite clearly describes what the ServerName directive is and where to
 set it can be quickly figured out by looking around, thinking "hmm,
 configuration may be in the directory named conf", looking at *.conf,
 seeing "hey, here is a commented out example of ServerName that tells me
 how to set it", and setting it.
 
 You can't just sit there and not think and expect things to be handed to
 you step by step.

 Some people are just idiots; not knowing things is fine, although this
 isn't the place to learn such basic things, but refusing to even make the
 most remote attempt to learn is idiotic.  Guess we better give this guy a
 full refund.

 Dear Marc Slemko,
     Well then maybe I am confused, I humbled myself to get help...this is
 THE Apache server project right.....  Well I thought I made myself clear, I
 could NOT get it up and running I read the whole manual and everything from
 serverroot to notes on the stability of the win 32 version....  but every
 time I try to set anything it doesn't give a clue as to where you might find
 out the info you need to input it instead if you are not sure (on anything I
 might add) check with you network administrator (I happen to be just that so
 he is no help)   I will thank you for the insult in your last mail, and also
 the lack of aid you provided....
 Oh..I almost forgot i am just one person so my opinion doesn't matter and
 you are a VIP  with the Apache Project and you are a god...so I will crawl
 away and BUY me some software with tech support...  I hope you let others at
 the Apache Project know you just scared away another believer in the
 project...  I am one no longer you have to be a programmer or a college
 educated network systems administrator to figure out this software.  Alos I
 asked for a little help and you shoot me down at the knees ...thanks alot
 from this humble poor guy with a peicemeal computer and a love for the
 net...  well anyway I have to go and find a server that offers tech
 support... along with clear directions...
 
 
 
 Sincerly,
 
 Raymond
 
 P.S. : I did read all the *.conf files just in case you're wondering  and
 they were as clear as mud...

 Bye.
 
 You come in, ignoring everything we ask you to provide when reporting a
 bug, ignoring everything we tell you about the appropiate places to go if
 you need basic installation support, ignoring and refusing to answer all
 the questions I ask you in an attempt to figure out your problem, and then
 get upset when we won't babysit you.  No one is going to take that sort of
 abuse from you without being paid a whole lot for it.
