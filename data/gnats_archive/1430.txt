>Description:
Sometimes "access failed" errors are logged with a stray newline following the
date string but prior to the closing "]".  The log entry continues on the next
line starting with the "]" character.  For example:

> [Mon Nov 17 12:44:08 1997
> ] access to /local/www/home/grpproc/production/crisp.html failed for 199.72.241.189, reason: File does not exist

Only "File does not exist" errors exhibit this behavior.  It does not seem to
be associated with any particular URI, nor with any particular connecting host.
These entries always log an IP address; most of the IPs have either no DNS A
records or nslookup reports an .in-addr.arpa alias and a hostname.  But at least
some of these addresses are in normal "access failed"/"File does not exist" log
entries, as well as in other errors.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have been unable to repeat the problem.  A partial list of IP addresses that
have exhibited this behavior on my server can be found at:

State-Changed-Why:
I doubt this is anything that Apache is doing wrong, I've never
seen it on linux, solaris, or irix.  I guess AIX has some weird
bug.  Although hmm, the util.c get_time() function does do some
suspect crap, it shouldn't be wrong with an ANSI-spec ctime()
function.  Without a reproduceable case and/or access to AIX
it'd be hard for us to fix this.

One thing you may want to look at is if these occur at specific
offsets in the error log... maybe there's a stdio bug.

At any rate I'm gonna close this ... if you figure out anything
more send it our way.
