>Description:
The problem actually involves interaction of mod_rewrite with mod_include.  

Background:  The main server document root is "/html".  
The URL "http://mydomain.com/xxx/doc.shtml" would serve file "/html/xxx/doc.shtml".
I have defined a virtual host "productxxx.com" with document root "/html/xxx".  
The same document can now be reached as "http://productxxx.com/doc.shtml".

The problem:  Within doc.shtml are references such as 'SRC="/xxx/image/prod.gif"'  
and '<!--#include virtual="/xxx/header.html" -->'.  The virtual host is defined 
by:  

<VirtualHost *>  
ServerName productxxx.com  
DocumentRoot /html/xxx  
ServerPath /xxx/  
RewriteEngine on  
RewriteRule ^/xxx/(.*) /$1 [L,R]  
</VirtualHost>  

The image references are being properly converted (from the access_log):  

132.246.156.20 - - [08/Nov/2001:17:43:24 -0500] "GET /xxx/images/prod.gif HTTP/1.0" 302 294 "http://productxxx.com/doc.shtml" "Mozilla/4.76C-SGI [en] (X11; I; IRIX 6.5 IP20)" "productxxx.com"  
132.246.156.20 - - [08/Nov/2001:17:43:25 -0500] "GET /images/prod.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 1301 "http://productxxx.com/doc.shtml" "Mozilla/4.76C-SGI [en] (X11; I; IRIX 6.5 IP20)" "productxxx.com"  

but the SSI is not (from the error_log):  

[Thu Nov  8 17:43:22 2001] [error] [client 132.246.156.20] File does not exist: /html/xxxheader.html
[Thu Nov  8 17:43:22 2001] [error] [client 132.246.156.20] unable to include "/xxx/header.html" in parsed file /html/xxx/doc.shtml  

The file reference should be "/html/xxx/header.html", but a "/" is missing.  

I know I could correct this by removing "/xxx" everywhere, but I was hoping  
to be able to use "http://mydomain.com/xxx/doc.shtml" and  
"http://productxxx.com/doc.shtml" during a transition period.  
(The URLs and log entries have been modified to simplify the discussion.)
>How-To-Repeat:
The real URLs for the above are:  
  http://www.nrc.ca:1200/ccbfc/site_E.shtml  
and
  http://www.ccbfc.org:1200/site_E.shtml  
>Fix:
I have tried various versions of the RewriteRule, using "//$1", "\/$1", "/./$1".  
It appears as though the include processing is "cleaning" the URL after the 
rewrite and dropping the "/".
>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Fri Nov  9 05:31:00 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

mod_include subrequests are not going to follow an
external redirect.  Try removing the [R] from your
RewriteRule.

This question is more appropriate for a user mailing
list or newsgroup.

Thanks for using Apache!
