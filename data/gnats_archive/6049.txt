>Description:
ap_unescape_url in util.c does not change '+' in the url to be a space. This is a part of the specification for url encoding. This results in mixed levels of unescaping whenever ap_unescape_url is called. Coupled with the fact that almost all urls get erroneously unescaped (see my report general/6048), this can be extremely annoying.
>How-To-Repeat:
Together with bug 6048, the sequence in any url "+%2b" will be incorrectly translated to "  " rather than " +".
>Fix:
Include a check for '+' in ap_unescape_url and change it to space.
