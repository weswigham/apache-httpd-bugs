 Hi,
 I tried to look for any queries/problems with the
 Apache Web site about the Apache HTTP Server running
 on an AMD chip (Window 2000), but I could not be able
 to find any.
 
 The problem I experienced is that I could not start
 the server after I have installed successfully. One
 primary question I would like to ask before I
 investigate the problem further, IS IT TRUE THAT THE
 Apache HTTP Server ONLY WORK ON THE PENTIUM processor
 ???. 
 
 I raised this question is because I have read
 somewhere(which I could not recall now) about this.
 
 Your respond is really appreciated, since I don't know
 who can tell me the exact answer for this and I don't
 want to go about changing my processor on the new
 computer if I don't need to, since I think there may
 be a way to get around to make it work with the AMD
 chip processor. is it right ?
 
 ... many thanks in advanced.
 
 Have a lovely day.
 
 KHT.
