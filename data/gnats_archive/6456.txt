>Description:
force-response and downgrade options only work for successfully-served static documents.
If a handler (e.g. PHP) is used, or an errordocument served, the the response will
be HTTP/1.1, chunked etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set force-response and downgrade options globally. Telnet to port 80 on server and request
a non-static document or send a request that will cause an errordocument to be served.
>Fix:
Some serious restructuring of the source code :(
