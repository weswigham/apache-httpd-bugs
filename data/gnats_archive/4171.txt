bash$ uname -a; gcc -v
SunOS l98upww2 5.6 Generic_105181-11 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

>Description:
Parameters that are conditionally met based on <IfDefine> are reported 
back as being configured by mod_info, regardless of whether <IfDefine> was met.
>How-To-Repeat:
I put the following in my httpd.conf and restart apache (without -DBOGUS)

<IfDefine BOGUS>
LoadModule jserv_module         /apps/apache/run/jserv/lib/mo_jserv.so
</IfDefine>

I then go to /server-info and I read:

Module Name: mod_so.c 
Content handlers: none
Configuration Phase Participation: Create Server Config
Request Phase Participation: none
Module Directives: 
     LoadModule - a module name and the name of a shared object file to load it from 
     LoadFile - shared object file or library to load into the server at runtime 
Current Configuration: 
httpd.conf 
     LoadModule jserv_module /apps/apache/run/jserv/lib/mo_jserv.so
