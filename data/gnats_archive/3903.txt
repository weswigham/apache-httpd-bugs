>Description:
In the httpd configuration file, using the ALIAS command

The Fake name needs to be 14 characters or less. Longer names are not flagged as an error, and the command does not work.

The fake name is case sensitive. In windows (or OS/2) this doesn't make a lot of sense).

I suggest the following lines be added to httpd.conf under the notes on aliases.
#
# Keep fake names to 14 or less characters
# Fake names are case sensitive
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an ALIAS fake name with more than 14 characters, eg

Alias /PROJECT_OFFICE/ "//sys1/technical/project office/"
Alias /Project_office/ "//sys1/technical/project office/"
Alias /Project_Office/ "//sys1/tecnical/project office/"

Set the real name appropriately, create a web page using the ALIAS and attempt to access the link.
>Fix:
Either
1) update documentation to describe syntax and restrictions of ALIAS
or
2) allow longer fakenames
   and/or
   remove case significance of fakenames for Windows versions

State-Changed-Why:

I don't believe this is an issue any longer in the most
recent versions of Apache.  Please try Apache 1.3.12/Win32
and report if you continue to have issues with long alias
names or case sensitivity.

Note that Apache is inherently a case sensistive environment.
