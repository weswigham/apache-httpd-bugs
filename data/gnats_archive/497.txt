>Description:
If content-negotiation is turned on generally, and a cgi program (say foo.cgi)
is called unqualified, say as /cgi-bin/foo, it loses its script-ness, and
returns the source code as text/html!!

>How-To-Repeat:
Find a script named foo.cgi on a machine with content-neg on, and
call it as foo ... yikes!
>Fix:
This is obviously pretty bad. I will turn off negotiation in cgi-bin dirs,
and I think something like <Files ~ .cgi|.pl> -ContentNegotiation 
(or whatever the syntax is) will plug the hole generally, but what happens if
there are alternate version of a script, eg foo.cgi.es|en ?

Seems like maybe mod_negotiation should be moved the other side of mod_cgi
in the Makefile?? I don't know what that might affect though...%0

State-Changed-When: Fri May  2 15:30:54 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Solved by using "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi" and/or by
turning off multiviews in the cgi-bin directory.  For example:

<Directory /server/root/cgi-bin>
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

Thanks for using Apache!
