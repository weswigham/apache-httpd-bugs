>Release:        1.3.12
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.15, Redhat 6.2, self compiled
>Description:
The encoding apptribute requires quotes around the "none".  The documentation
is not clear on this point.  Putting a document out without the quotes is 
disasterous -- it terminates parsing, with prejudice, leaving out the remainder
of the parsed file.  In our case that left the site showing blank pages to 
Netscape clients for a significant amount of time.  

FWIW, I think making the default "entity": when the previous default was "none" 
was an extremely poor choice.  1.3.12 broke a significant amount of our site
and required much work to upgrade as a result of this additional "feature" 
which changed the default behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
<!--#echo encoding=none var="REMOTE_SERVER" -->
>Fix:
Graceful error handling would be appropriate -- why abort the file instead 
finding the matching --> and continuing on with the rest of the include?  A 
meaningful and comprehendible error message would make a good second choice.
