>Description:
The netscape browsers 3.0 and 4.0.1 cannot play midi background music
on the URL http://www.brazil-brasil.com/open.htm, yet it can on the URL
HTTP://www.flic.net/~dinh/open.htm.  Those two URLs have the exact same
content and brazil-brasil.com is a virtual host on flic.net with the
following configuration:

<VirtualHost brazil-brasil.com>
ServerAdmin webmaster@brazil-brasil.com
DocumentRoot /u/brazzil/html
ServerName brazil-brasil.com
ServerAlias brazil-brasil.com *.brazil-brasil.com
ErrorLog logs/brazil-brasil.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/brazil-brasil.com-access_log
Alias /icons/ /u/brazzil/icons/
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /u/brazzil/cgi-bin/
</VirtualHost>

After reading through the FAQ, I tried adding

	AddType audio/x-midi .mid .midi .kar

to the httpd configuration file but it did not help.

Appreciate your help on this problem,

>How-To-Repeat:
Yes.  I'm running netscape 3.0 on a Windows 95 system.  The browser
cannot play background music on the URL www.brazil-brasil.com/open.htm
but it can on the URL www.flic.net/~dinh/open.htm.  Like I mentioned
already, the contents on those two URLs are exactly the same.

Here is one of the methods it uses to start up the background music:

<EMBED SRC="xosatana.mid" AUTOSTART=true VOLUME=100 HIDDEN=true WIDTH=10
 HEIGHT=10></EMBED><NOEMBED><BGSOUND SRC="xosatana.mid"></NOEMBED>
>Fix:
I mucked around with the configuration files without any luck.
In short, I don't have a clue

This is a followup on the last bug report that I sent.
This problem does not happen when using microsoft internet explorer v 3.01.
This problem occurs when using netscape in some patterns.  I am enumerating
some of the cases.
 1. open up www.brazil-brasil.com/open.htm works.
 2. open up www.brazil-brasil.com follows by a click on the blinking eye fails.
 3. open up www.flic.net/~dinh follows by a click on the blinking eye works.
 4. open up www.flic.net/~dinh/open.htm works.

I think this is a netscape problem.

State-Changed-Why:
This is probably a bug in Netscape.

Is anything recorded in your logfiles when you access the
page that doesn't work correctly?  Check both access and
error logs for both the specific virtual domain and for
the main server logs.  It may be that Netscape isn't properly
sending the Host; header for background sounds.

Appears to be a Netscape issue; nothing Apache can do.
