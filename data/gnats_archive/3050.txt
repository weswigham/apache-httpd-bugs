State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Sep 23 09:04:53 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is _NOT_ an appropriate place to be sending this.

First, as we clearly state we can not support ancient versions
like 1.1.3.

Second, this is detailed in the docs.

 Where?
  
 Instead of a curt and unhelpful diatribe, a simple yes or no
 would have A), helped me greatly and b), saved you some time.
 
 As it is you have now alienated a user of your product.

 Then you have to look a bit more closely or ask in the other forums
 referenced.  We don't have the resources to answer basic use questions
 from millions of users.
