WIN 2000 SP1, Microsoft Client for Netware
>Description:
If i configure the document root to a local disk, such as "c:/dir", all works fine, but if i configure the doc-root to a directory on a network server, such as "//Servername/vol/dir" or "w:/dir", where w: is a mapped drive to the Netware Volume //Servername/vol, it seems, that apache (as system service) get no access to the server.
That is surely not a problem of apache, but do you have any suggestions to solve this problem ?  Under WIN NT 4.0 it works fine, without any problems.
Thank you in advance

State-Changed-When: Sun Apr 15 11:15:13 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

The problem is that the default system userid does
not have permission to access network drives.  You
need to modify the permissions under which Apache
runs as a service.

Thanks for using Apache!
