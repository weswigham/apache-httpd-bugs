State-Changed-Why:
Those directives are defined and handled by the proxy
module.  It seems clear that you haven't included that
module in your server.  Edit your src/Configuration file
to uncomment the "AddModule modules/proxy/libproxy.a" line,
re-run src/Configure and re-make, and install the new
server binary.
