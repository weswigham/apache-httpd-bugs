>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, Build 4.00.1381 Service Pack 5
>Description:
In the file "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache JServ 1.1.1\conf\jserv.properties" is the heading 
#   Apache JServ Configuration File   #
which is the same as in the file "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache JServ 1.1.1\conf\jserv.conf"
This made me a bit confusion when configuring Apache JServ module to distinguish these two files at once.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look in the installation package for Microsoft Windows NT platform.
>Fix:
Change the heading in the jserv.properties this way:
#   Apache JServ Properties File   #
Trifle, but could be helpful.
