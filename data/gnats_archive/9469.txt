>Description:
By starting an antiviral software (Dr. Web 4.27) it checks memory.
By checking Apache process, Win2K.CodeRed.3569 was found in memory.
By checking the files nothing was found.
So far I know, Apache is not vulnerable for such the things. 

regards
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to infect with Win2K.CodeRed.3569.
>Fix:
Hmm... No idea what could it be...

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Jan 13 20:22:18 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
You should contact the vendor of your antivirus software.  Apparently, it is poorly implemented and treats the memory left over from a codered request as if something was infected.  Nothing Apache can do about this false positive by your antivirus software.
