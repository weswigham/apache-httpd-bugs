Windows NT 4.0 SP3
Microsoft VC++ 5.0 sp2
Mod_Perl 1.10+patches
>Description:
When starting the Apache service using the 'NET START apache' command the 
service control manager reports an Error 1067, but the Apache program does
start and continues to run.  I have not restarted the Server to see how it 
will respond.  It is almost as if the apache program starts as one process, 
exits and starts as another one.
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be able to 
Apache -i -d c:\apache
NET START apache
Check task manager and see it is still running
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
Have you tried this with the latest version of Apache?
Do you still receive the error?  Do you receive an error
if you start Apache from the command line (not as a
service)?
