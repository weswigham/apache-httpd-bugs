>Description:
I have been using Apache server pretty successfully. TOday the machine was 
rebooted and as usual I wanted to start the Apache server and as usual I gave the
following command :

./httpd -d <dir>

But to my surprise found that the server was not started ( Gave a ps and found
no httpd server running ). Then tried and again and again it resulted in the 
same result. Server not started. So went to the Logs file and found the following
meesage :

[Web Oct 28 11:05:11 1998] [crit] (48)Address already in use: make_sock: could
not bind to port 1080.

Well this means that the port 1080 has already been used ?
But when I have started the server only now how can the port be already in use ?
>How-To-Repeat:
Well the problem is repeatable only by me since its a server start problem.
>Fix:
Nopes. I tried to see if the port 1080 is free but dint know how to get hold
of the port 1080. Its critical to run this on this port as there are lots of 
dependencies and hence cant change the port 1080.

State-Changed-Why:
This message means that you already have something running
on that port.  1080 is the socks5 port, so check to be sure
you don't have any socks stuff running on that port.
Use "ps axuw" to check for running processes that look
like they could bind to the port, use "netstat -a  |grep LISTEN"
to see if there is a process listening on that port.

If you still can't find out what process it is, go search
for a program called "lsof" that can tell you what sockets
are open. eg. "lsof -n -i -P | grep 1080".

This really isn't an Apache problem.

 Yes, that is what it means.
 
 Try doing a 
 
 	ps -ax
 
 and see if you are running any deamons (such as a sockd deamon perhaps) or
 if there is anything left from a previous incarnation of apache.
 
 Using
 
 	netstat -na | grep 1080
 
 would also help, you can see if the kernel things if there is anything
 on that port.
 
 That is the most likeley cause.
