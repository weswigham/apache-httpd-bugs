>Environment:
OS: Windows 2000 Server with all current updates as of 08-Jan-2002.
Cold Fusion 4.5 with all current patches.
All shares verified and working correctly.
>Description:
Browser Error Message (from share, access is allowed as are shorter paths from the Internet): Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /Docs/Harveys_Supermarkets/Merchandisers/Planograms_MDR/849_-_HBC_Deodorant_and_Shampoo_and_Ethnic_and_Hairspray_COMBO/849c_-_04_FT_HBC_DEOORANT_SHAMPOO_ETHNIC_HAIRSPRAY_COMBO_SECTION_for_-MADIXandLOZIER_FIXTURE-_@_105A849A.PDF on this server.

Error Log entry (this is a valid file on the server with a length of 278 characters): [Tue Jan 08 10:50:50 2002] [error] [client 208.255.153.163] Filename is not valid: c:/program files/apache group/apache/htdocs/docs/harveys_supermarkets/merchandisers/planograms_mdr/849_-_hbc_deodorant_and_shampoo_and_ethnic_and_hairspray_combo/849b_-_04_ft_hbc_deoorant_shampoo_ethnic_hairspray_combo_section_for_-madixandlozier_fixture-_@_105a849a.pdf

A shorter file path/name works fine but limiting length causes other problems on intranet side.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I am at a loss if 255/256 characters is the maximum length of a path/file name.

State-Changed-Why:

This is not a bug, it is by [Microsoft's] design.

Apache 2.0 supports extremely long path names, on WinNT
and cousins (2000, XP), but long path names >260 characters
will still not be supported on Win9x (or ME).

This is a restriction on the Win32 API.  The introduction
of huge path names requires Unicode file path arguments
to system calls, and this only became possible under the
APR library with Apache 2.0.
