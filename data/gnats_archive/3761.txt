>Description:
Was working w/ the httpd.conf file and had started the server and set the MinSpareServers
and StartServers to 3, however I forgot to change the port it would run on 
(default is 8080).  I looked in the process table and 3 were running - that's all.
Then I had changed the running port to 80 and leaved everything else the same.  I restarted 
the server and 5 running processes showed up.  This doesn't seem right.  I asked 
a bunch of people about this and they told me just send in a bug report.  
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.  Start the server, change the port and restart (stopping and then starting 
does the same thing).
>Fix:
Don't have any time to look through the code right now, otherwise I'd tell you.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... are you sure that you didn't simply request some
documents from the server, making it spawn more processes?

This is really really unlikely to be a bug in Apache.  Please
take a closer look at what you are doing...

 I apologize for wasted time, but I did this last week Friday and I got 5
 seperate processes without trying to access anything via httpd.  I was
 running this on my sparc 5 workstation and I couldn't believe it.  I then
 went to chech the server-status and it still said 5 for the number of
 running processes.  From what I recall, the server (in general speaking) 
 itself shouldn't spawn any processes just for the hell of it.  
 
 In any case, ignore this then until I can give you some "documented"
 proof.  I should've done this last week when I saw it.
 
 Keep up the great work!  I was a big fan of NCSA in the early days and saw
 Apache come out from the woodwork.  I admit I was sure it was just another
 company trying to "fit in".  I was wrong.  Apache has become something
 better than the Netscape servers (minus the configuration menus... which
 are indeed nice. ;)
