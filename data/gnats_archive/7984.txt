Windows 9x
Apache/1.3.19 (Win32) mod_perl/1.25
Perl 5.00503
>Description:
An MS-DOS console briefly appears when Apache is started, stopped, or
re-started. I believe this is due to the creation of a child process
which frees its console, and allocates a new console, then hides the
new console's window.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start Apache from an MS-DOS command prompt.
>Fix:
The console hook code is complex (and it works!), so the danger of introducing
new bugs may outweigh removing this annoyance, but the following appears
to work:

In ../src/main/http_main.c: create_process(), set the 'dwCreationFlags' 
argument of the Win32 CreateProcess() call to 'CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE' for the case
of Win9x and not-a-service. Otherwise, use the existing value (of zero).

Then, in ../src/os/win32/service.c: ap_start_child_console(), remove the block:
   if (!is_child_of_service) {
        FreeConsole();
        AllocConsole();
    }

Here are the diffs for Apache 1.3.19:
../src/main/http_main.c:
6153a6154
>     DWORD createFlags;
6246a6248,6251
>     createFlags = 0;
>     if (!isWindowsNT() && !isProcessService())
>       createFlags = CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE;
> 
6249c6254
<                        0,         /* Creation flags */
---
>                        createFlags,         /* Creation flags */

../src/os/win32/service.c:

302,305d301
<     if (!is_child_of_service) {
<         FreeConsole();
<         AllocConsole();
<     }


A new console will be created by Win32 during CreateProcess() but without
the screen flash. If this causes problems, the screen flash can at least
be reduced somewhat by placing:
 if (console_wnd)
  ShowWindow(console_wnd, SW_HIDE);
before 
  Sleep(100)
