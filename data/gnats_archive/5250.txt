>Description:
I compiled with Borland compiler a simple C code like this:

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

	printf("Content-type: text/plain\r\n\r\n");
	printf("cgi test\r\n");
	exit(0);
}

Using the default configuratione files, I put the cgi.exe in the cgi-bin 
directory.
Then I try to request this cgi.exe by Netscape 4.05 browser: 
http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgi? 
The browser locks up waiting for a reply.
No error log in logs directory.

I red a lot of FAQ, a lot of bug report, tried what suggested in them like
"AddHandler cgi-script .exe" and setting "Options +ExecCGI" for the script 
alias directory, but I had no improvment.

What I have to do?
