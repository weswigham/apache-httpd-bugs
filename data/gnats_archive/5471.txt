>Description:
I have an intranet server (thorheim.holland) which has an URL /horde/imp, his works fine.
I created an Alias /webmail/ "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde/imp". Later I changed this to
Alias /webmail "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde/imp" only now when I type in:
thorheim.holland/webmail/ it works OK, when I type thorheim.holland/webmail it redirects me to
www.thorheim.com/webmail/ which obviously doesn't exist. It is not my domain either.
>How-To-Repeat:
Have an intranet server with the same name as a real domain (pref. .com) ??
>Fix:
no

When you are making up domains, you have to be consistent.
Somewhere in your configs you have www.thorheim.com as your
domain.  See http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ#set-servername

 As I said, the domain www.thorheim.com is not in any way related to the
 intranet server thorheim.holland. The problem got worse however. I can't
 call any url to a directory without a trailing '/'. I've tried to solve this
 by copying the httpd.con.default over the httpd.conf, than setting the
 servername and typed: thorheim.holland/manual  it (apache?) then puts me
 through to www.thorheim.com/manual/ (which doesn't exist) if I type
 thorheim.holland/manual/  however I can enter the manual.
 
 Problem with URL's (no longer mod_alias bug)
