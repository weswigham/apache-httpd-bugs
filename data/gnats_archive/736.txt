>Environment:
compiler: gcc 2.7.2.1
system:   OSF1 V3.2 41 alpha
>Description:
During compilation by gcc (not DEC's cxx) you get complaints about
pointers being cast as integers of a different size in alloc.c,
http_config.c, mod_alias.c, mod_dir.c, alloc.h, http_core.c,
mod_browser.c, mod_rewrite.c.  This is no wonder as any reasonable
compiler on any 64-bit machine should complain if you cast a pointer
to a 32-bit int.  I suspect memory problems might occur due to this
handling of pointers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache 1.2.0 (the older versions had the same problem, I
think) with a good compiler on a 64-bit machine.
>Fix:
The fix is quite simple, just change the relevant
occurences of `int' into `long.'  You can pick up my ideas of how
to change things at http://www.phys.ucl.ac.uk/~op/changes.tar.gz
(or http://ross.phys.ucl.ac.uk/~op/changes.tar.gz, or
http://guarnerius.phys.ucl.ac.uk/~op/changes.tar.gz).  Unfortunately,
I am not absolutely sure I have done everything consistently, after
all I have not written Apache.  But the server seems to be running
rather happily.  On 32-bit machines, longs are often the same length
as ints (32 bits), so changing the important `ints' into `longs'
should be OK.  Alternatively, you can introduce preprocessor
directives of the sort:

#if defined( __alpha) || defined(__mips64)
long stuff
#else
int stuff
#endif

etc, and put the `long' alternatives inside those.

 There's a patch in the dist/contrib directory that fixes this.  We should
 add it to the known bugs page too.
 
 Hey wait, the patch isn't there any more.  Ugh I wonder where it went.  At
 any rate yeah there's a few 64-bit patches floating around.
 
 Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
Something will be done about this by the time we release 1.3.
The code is actually safe as it is, it just generates warnings
'cause gcc can't tell if we're doing the unsafe manipulations.
