>Description:
As already suggested in PR 2832 (another author), it would be a very useful
feature if it would be possible to do things as following:

 <!--#set var="var_name" value="x" -->
 <!--#set var="$var_name" value="2" -->

(same for echo, Example taken from PR 2832)

 <!--#echo var="$var_name" -->

The answer for PR 2832 was: "Send a mail, if you really want this to
be added" and I dont know, whether it was considererd to add.

This would be a very useful feature when also working with mod_rewrite:

Scenario: mod_rewrite sets an env-var which is then used in shtml-files
to print the content of these vars indirectly.

This allows an additional level of indirection which opens a whole new
class of flexiblity.

I am using this for several time (I patched Apache) and saved a lot of work
and time.
>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
A patch was already included in PR 2832 (for 1.2).

I can provide another patch for 1.3.12 and/or 2.0aXX, if you consider to add
this feature. The patch is simple, has no side effects and is obviously correct.
