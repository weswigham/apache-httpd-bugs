>Description:
The following error appears without asking me for a username or password. If I use netscape and not IE, then it asks for the username and password but does not allow access. I have spoken with the webadmin at the other site and apparently they have no other partners unable to access the site, the only difference between us is the proxy server ( apparently! )

HTTP Error 401
401.2 Unauthorized: Logon Failed due to server configuration

This error indicates that the credentials passed to the server do not match the credentials required to log on to the server. This is usually caused by not sending the proper WWW-Authenticate header field.

Please contact the Web server's administrator to verify that you have permission to access to requested resource.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://corp.skymall.com and see if it asks you for security with IE4.
>Fix:
No, I'm afraid not.

 OK I got a sniffer on it and it wants NTLM authentication. I assume there is
 no way of getting this to work. I'm not much of an NT person so I'm not sure
 what this is all about.
 
 Ken.

State-Changed-When: Sun Mar 14 13:23:27 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
NTLM autentication is proprietary M$ authentication
scheme and violates the HTTP specifications (a duplicate
WWW-Authenticate header with wrong syntax is added to
the reponse by the MS Internet Information Server).

Most browsers (e.g. Netscape Navigator, Lynx) ignore
the duplicate header, but older MSIE browsers simply
fail... welcome to the wonderful world of Microsoft.

This isn't a bug in mod_proxy. You should complain
to Microsoft about this problem (and ask the admin
of the site to turn of NTLM authentication).
