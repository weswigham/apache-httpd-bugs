SunOS metropolis 5.3 Generic_101318-83 sun4m sparc
>Description:
mp3 files are not defined in the mime.types file under audio.mpeg,
which does have support for mp2 and mpga files.  This caused 
Netscape and lynx to download as a text file rather than as a binary,
IE handles files correctly
>How-To-Repeat:
load any mp3 file under netscape or lynx and file gets treated improperly
>Fix:
add mp3 to the extension under the audio/mpeg file type in mime.types fil

State-Changed-When: Mon Feb  2 08:50:53 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
I will have to check to see if mp2 is a registered suffix
for audio/mpeg.  In the meantime you can work around this
by adding the following line to one of your *.conf files:

 AddType audio/mpeg mp2
