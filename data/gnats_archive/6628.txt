I use Apache 1.3.12 win32
>Description:
I saw that Apache supported SSL via modules...
But why not add a built-in support for
SSL 2.0
SSL 3.0
PCT
TLS
Fortezza
then it would be much easier to use and configure apache and maybe more would use Apache Web Server.
I saw a Web server from www.imatrix.com called Xitami, that web server doesn't have support for much things, it is a cheap server, it suckz, but it can be installed and configured in minutes.
If Apache Web Server would be that easy to configure it would rock.
Because it is hard to configure apache, and it takes time, and it is hard to download and install extra modules, and various addons.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make a GUI or something, and add support for a hell bunch of web server things.
>Fix:
Start programming ;)

Comment-Added:
This is not a simple matter of programming. Because we are
based in the USA we have to get permission to distribute
cryptographical code. We are in the process of doing so,
and we hope to include SSL with Apache-2.0, but in the mean
time you'll have to use one of the SSL modules.
