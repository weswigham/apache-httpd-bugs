Sun's cc complier.
>Description:
# more .htaccess
AuthName OpCenter
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /usr/apache/etc/usersuser

require valid-user

This does not allow access to the secured directory.  Keep getting authorization
failure.  Nothing shows in the error_log.  

When I try the wrong password I get
user psmeast: password mismatch: /private/

On a user not in password file user chuck not found: /private/

When I change the require statment to this everything works fine.

# more .htaccess
AuthName OpCenter
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /usr/apache/etc/usersuser

require user psmeast
