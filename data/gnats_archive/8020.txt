apache-mod_ssl-1.3.19.2.8.1-1.6.0
RedHat 7.0
>Description:
in my httpd.conf all is 
AllowOverride None

but in documentation is:
Default: AllowOverride All 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#allowoverride

apache package was downloaded from http://www.modssl.org/ 
 have just downloaded apache-1.3.20 from Your site and the problem is the same !

BTW: Can You remove (from httpd.conf) Indexes options in the letest releases of apache ?
     
>How-To-Repeat:
Change :

-AllowOveride None
+AllowOveride All

State-Changed-Why:

The "Default" in the documentation gives what will happen
if the directive is not included in the config file at
all.  It is not necessarily the same as the value
of the directive in the default httpd.conf.

Thanks for using Apache!
