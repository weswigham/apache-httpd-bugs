>Environment:
Operating system Ultrix 4.4 and 4.5 (mips) "ULTRIX bbuxms2.bb.pvt.sk 4.4 0 RISC"
>Description:
This is not a bug of Apache, but one of Ultrix
(filter sed has a small "problem" with regular expressions).
Therefore it is necessary to slightly modify script ./src/Configure

Configuration by means of script configure is not ok, this error message
is displayed:

command garbled: s/\([^\]\)"/\1/g
sh: htconf.11251.5: cannot open

and file ./src/include/ap_config_auto.h will not be generated
>How-To-Repeat:
Run for example:

CFLAGS=-O2 sh5 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --disable-rule=SHARED_CORE
>Fix:
Command in ./src/Configure:
 
tmpstr=`echo $CFLAGS $TEXTRA_CFLAGS |\
        sed -e 's;[     ]-;!-;g' -e 's/\\\"/\"/g' -e 's/\([^\\]\)"/\1/g'`

should be replaced with command:

tmpstr=`echo $CFLAGS $TEXTRA_CFLAGS |\
        sed -e 's;[     ]-;!-;g' -e 's/\\\"/\"/g' -e 's/\([^\\\]\)"/\1/g'`

(e.g., one more backslash should be added in the third expression for sed)
