NT4 SP6a applied. Apache installed from apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src-r2.msi
to f:\Apache
>Description:
apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src-r2.msi sets up a shortcut to "Apache Docs Online"
with a command that looks like
C:\http:/\httpd.apache.org/docs

It should look like

<default browser> url to the docs directory

I've edited my shortcut to
J:\Netscape\Program\netscape.exe  "http://httpd.apache.org/docs"

and that works very nicely.

Thank you

Don Sharp
>How-To-Repeat:
Do a test install on NT4 SP6a with

msiexec /i apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src-r2.msi

and examine the Apache Docs Online shortcut
>Fix:
Look in the registry for the default program for extensions .htm .html
and set the shortcut accordingly
