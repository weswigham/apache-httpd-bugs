Win NT 4 SP4
Netscape 4
Sun JSDK 2.0
JServ 1.0b1
>Description:
I can get to the JServ status page but when I try to click on the link:
Mapped Servlet Engines
ajpv11://127.0.0.1:8007

I get an internal system error and the following appearing in the mod_jserv.log:
[07/02/1999 18:50:55:000] (EMERGENCY) ajp11: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007
[07/02/1999 18:50:55:000] (EMERGENCY) ajp11: connection fail
[07/02/1999 18:50:55:000] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "ajpv11"
[07/02/1999 18:50:55:000] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "status"
>How-To-Repeat:
Set everything up (Apache then JServ) with defaults and click on the link specified.
>Fix:
I've tried running it on various port numbers but without success. Seems to not like the ajp11 protocol.
Thanks for the help.
