>Description:
I Guess my problem is pretty simple, but I can`t find "how to" regarding my bug.

How du I prevent people to access my directory, only through using index.html.

(I don´t want them to see all my files, in listed form)

State-Changed-Why:
We make it very clear that this is for bug reports, not
for support questions.  Alternate methods of finding
support are listed.  We can not answer millions of people's
questions about how to configure their server.
