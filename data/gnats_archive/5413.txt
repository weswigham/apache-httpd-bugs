>Description:
Here is the typical result when I look at the environment variables within
a CGI script (Bourne shell or Perl):
________________ = 
Apache/1.3.9 Server at hooke.owen.sj.ca.us Port 80

_______________ = HTTP/1.0
______________ = GET
_____________ = /usr/local/httpd/httpd_site/htdocs
____________ = 
___________ = /cgi-bin/printenv
_________ = owen.sj.ca.us
____________________ = en
____ = /sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
___________________ = iso-8859-1,*,utf-8
_________________ = CGI/1.1

It appears that the environment variables are passed, but the names/labels have
had each character converted to underscores (_).  This causes endless problems
for the Perl scripts.
I have searched the bug list, FAQ, etc. and deja.com to see if anyone else has
reported such a problem ... found nothing close.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://owen.sj.ca.us/cgi-bin/printenv
(It's only available during working hours & the middle of the night -
 Pacific Time).
>Fix:
No.  However, if you have any ideas where to look ... I can  attach to
the process and see what's happening.
