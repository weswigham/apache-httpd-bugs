>Description:
This patch fixes two small bugs in the Apache 1.3.0 sourcecode:

1. The time that Randy Terbush decided to change the default group from
   "nouser" to "nogroup", he forgot to change it one time in conf.h.
 
2. Another small mistake appears in mod_usertrack, where the generation
   of the unique cookie happens. mod_usertrack simply forget to double
   the remote servername before it truncates it, therefore only a bit 
   of the remote servername is available the rest of the server process,
   this by example means that the remove servername would appear wrong
   in logfiles and thereby confuse logsystems even instead of helping
   them.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Some systems like BSDI BSD/OS 3.0 with the Virtual Kernel gets annoyed when trying to use "nouser" when it doesn't exist.
2. The problem appears when you're using mod_usertrack, everytime a new user that doesn't have a cookie enter your server.
   It's easy to see in e.x. an access-logfile
