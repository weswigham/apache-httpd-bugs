FreeBSD 2.2.8-STABLE
>Description:
Due to the limit imposed by HOWMANY symbol, the zmagic() function in
mod_mime_magic.c attempts to uncompress first 4k of the file only,
and mod_mime_magic module is unable to detect the type of uncompressed
contents.

The following entry appears in the error_log:

httpd: [Sun Mar 21 18:17:04 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] mod_mime_magic:
read failed /home/WWW/Home/cdrom/cc/td/doc/product/software/ssr91/rn_9_14/78116.htm

This error is generated in mod_mime_magic.c:2198, since ap_bread()
was unable to read any data from gzip process pipe.
>How-To-Repeat:
Discovered when browsing Cisco Documentation CD (it contains compressed
HTML files) -- some file (smaller) were properly displayed by
Netscape and lynx, while others were not. I guess that the module's
primary objective is to allow browsing of Cisco CD, since it was
submitted to you by Cisco:)

Sample files can be downloaded from http://www.system.pl/internal/mod_mime_magic/
(Note this server has mod_mime_magic disabled).

The file small_gzipped.htm should work ok with a standard module.

>Fix:
In http://www.system.pl/internal/mod_mime_magic/patch I enclose a patch
which allows to read large compressed files and fixes another bug
(files without ending ".Z" cannot be verified by module due to the way
"uncompress" utility works).

I have modified the options given to gzip utility - now they include
a file name. 
I have tried to fix it loading the whole compressed file into memory,
but this failed on large files (>100k) - like max_gzipped.htm on my site.
There may be another bug in the way apache handles pipes to- and from- 
process.
E-mail me for further details.

State-Changed-Why:
I get a 403 when I try to access the URLs you listed.

We deliberately limit the amount sent to unzip/uncompress --
because we don't want to use lots of memory or CPU time
to do it.  The first 4k should be enough to identify all
files...

Also it uses "uncompress -c" and passes it the compressed
data on stdin -- so uncompress never deals with a filename,
so I don't see how it can complain about a lack of .Z.

 My apologies. Now this is (hopefully) fixed.

 It seems that we have to sacrifice CPU and memory.
 I haven't found any way to force gzip to uncompress
 a fragment of the file.
 It fails with exit code 1 when the compressed file/
 data stream is not complete.
 Yes, it would be enough to supply first 4k of uncompressed contents.
 Perhaps we should integrate mod_mime_magic with zlib.
 
 Consider this:

 Yes, this is the "bug" introduced with my modification --
 it uses the file on disk directly, and it doesn't have to
 have a ".Z" or ".gz" extension. 
 
 However, my patch allows me to browse Cisco Documentation CD
 without any problems and with now need for proprietary
 software supplied by Cisco for Windows and some commercial
 UNIX platforms.
