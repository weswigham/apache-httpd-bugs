apache
>Environment:
Linux i386, 2.4.15, gcc-2.96.3, Apache 2.0.28
>Description:
I used "ab -X yetix:3128 http://yetix:8080/100.html" to benchmark
Apache on 8080 with a Squid proxy running on port 3128.

ab send the following header to the proxy:

GET  HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: ApacheBench/2.0.28
Host: yetix
Accept: */*

This is definetly wrong !
