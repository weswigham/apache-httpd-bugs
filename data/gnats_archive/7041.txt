>Description:
Hi 
I recently installed Apache 1.3.14(win32) on my Intel PC under Windows 95. 
I have had mixed results running CGI scripts;. Some run, some dont. for example, 
I copied a number of  batch files from books and  online sources to cgi-bin and
 ran it from the DOS prompt . It worked OK. But, When I tried to run the batch
 file from my browser ( Netscape 4) nothing happened. I didnt get an error 
message, but I didnt get output either. The statusline message at the bottom of
 the screen was "local 
host contacted. Waiting for reply" . On the other hand I downloaded some  sample
programs (envvir.exe and pagequery.exe from www.prenhall.com/zeid) from some 
websites and they run fine.

I have had the same problem with other CGI scripts, both DOS batch files and 
compiled programs (written in  C++ and Fortran!). They are all very simple programs
that run correctly from DOS or Windows, but wont produce output when called fro a browser.
Is there something about the way that I am compiling them that makes a difference? 
It seems that any program that has the content-type statement should work, 
or is there something else that is needed?

If you have any ideas, I would appreciate your help.

Thanks 

Bob Stewart

Here is a copy of a file that wont run

   echo Content-type: text/plain 
   echo.

State-Changed-When: Thu Feb 15 13:38:41 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

This is a known bug with 1.3.14 - the child process in that
revision of Apache lost it's console window, so the pipes
that communicate the CGI stream aren't properly opened or
closed.

Please upgrade to 1.3.17
