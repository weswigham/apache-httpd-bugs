>Release:        1.1.3
>Environment:
HPUX 10.2 with most of the recent patches on 715/100
gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
1. Defining getwd(d) as getcwd(d,MAX_STRING_LEN) in conf.h is not necessary
for HPUX 10.2 (I don't know about 10.x in general, since I only have access to
10.2). It is already defined in unistd.h, the compiler produces a parse error
and stopps if used. Not using this line works fine.

2. IN HPUX 10.2 the select() call doesn't use int pointers any more, the 
special handling of this in http_main.c and mod_proxy.c isn't necessary. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile apache using HPUX 10.2
>Fix:
Include an additional Configuration block named HPUX10 or something like that
in the configuration.

State-Changed-Why:
The getwd() was fixed and will be available in 1.2b7 when
released.

Still trying to figure out exactly when HP changed the
select call and how we can detect what version is being
used nicely.
