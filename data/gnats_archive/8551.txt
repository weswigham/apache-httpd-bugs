>Environment:
Tested on: 
  - SunOS agip 5.7 Generic_106541-08 sun4u sparc
  - NetBSD 1.5.2 i386
>Description:
In any directory "MultiViews" options are allowed, users can get
"406 Not Acceptale" page by sending illegal "Accept:" line such as
"Accept: none".  This unveils some partial directory information
regardless of "Indexes" option setting.

When user requests "/foo", "foo.*" are listed by 406 page. This sometimes
contains user backup files or so.

>Fix:
adding validation checks for "Accept" or "Accept-*" headers 
in  parse_accept_headers() in mod_negotiate.c will improve this problem...
