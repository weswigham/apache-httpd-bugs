FreeBSD agora.rdrop.com 2.1.5-STABLE
gcc version 2.6.3
>Description:
When someone is accessing a /~user/ URL with an older browser that
doesn't include the Host: header in the request, the Alias is ignored
and Apache attempts to look in public_html instead of where the Alias
told it to in srm.conf (verified with ktrace).  If either the Host:
header is present, or /users/user (which is aliased the same way as /~)
is used, it works correctly (I even set ServerName outside of the
virtual host sections, and it made no difference):

Alias /icons/ /var/httpd/icons/
Alias /~ /home/web/
Alias /users/ /home/web/

State-Changed-When: Sat Aug  2 12:50:06 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Are the Alias settings inside any VirtualHost section?  Are
there any settings inside any VirutalHost section that could
impact this?

Try cutting it down to the minimal config necessary to
reproduce the problem.  I can not do so here.

What does the error log say for connections that you
think should work but don't?

What do you have UserDir set to?  Did you try disabling
it?
