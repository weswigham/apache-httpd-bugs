>Description:
When attempting to use the UnsetEnv directive, which the docs say "Removes one or more environment variables from those passed on to CGI scripts."
However, the ENV variable that I try to remove is still being passed to the the CGI program.
This is distinctly non-critical, but something that I observed while tinkering with my config files.
>How-To-Repeat:
In httpd.conf, put the line:
UnsetEnv SERVER_NAME
or similar. Then run a CGI program that dumps the environment variables, such as:

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
for(keys%ENV){print"$_ => $ENV{$_}<br>\n";}

The environment variable specified (SERVER_NAME) is still being supplied to the CGI.

Comment-Added:

Some environment variables are *required* by the CGI
spec.  SERVER_NAME is one of these.  See the description
at <http://Web.Golux.com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-03-clean.html#6.1.15>.
If your claim is that UnsetEnv doesn't work for *any*
envariable in a CGI environment, that's a legitimate bug --
but SERVER_NAME is not a good example. :-)

Synopsis-Changed-From: UnsetEnv does not actually Unset the Env

State-Changed-Why:

I'm just going to document that mod_env directives
can't be used to override the "standard" server-generated
environment variables.  I think that is the intended
and actual behavior.
