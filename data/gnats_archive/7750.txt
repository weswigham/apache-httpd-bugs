>Environment:
Linux 2.2.17-14smp #1 
>Description:
The default configure and install will install duplicate
files, some of which will go into system directories rather
than the proper Apache PREFIX.

eg.
/usr/local/lib:
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      2011228 May 19 23:56 libapr.a
-rw-rw-r--    1 root     root          622 May 19 23:56 libapr.la
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       664082 May 19 23:57 libaprutil.a
-rw-rw-r--    1 root     root          634 May 19 23:57 libaprutil.la
/usr/local/apache2/lib:
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      1914744 May  9 20:44 libapr.a
-rw-rw-r--    1 root     root          607 May  9 20:44 libapr.la
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       991868 May  9 20:44 libaprutil.a
-rw-rw-r--    1 root     root          619 May  9 20:44 libaprutil.la

The same is true for the include directory which is completely duplicated
in /usr/local/apache2/include and /usr/local/include/
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure
make
make install

Comment-Added:
I just realized from looking at dates that the
files in /usr/local/apache2/lib are from a previous
install.  Those files are ONLY being installed
in /usr/local/lib when no --prefix is specified.

The include/ files ARE being installed in both
locations, however.

State-Changed-Why:
I have just committed a fix to this problem.  Basically,
we weren't passing the prefix to the libraries that Apache
relies on.  By passing that information to the libraries,
everything is always installed to the correct locations.
