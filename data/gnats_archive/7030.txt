The Apache service named Apache reported the following error:
>How-To-Repeat:
Install 1.3.14 from binary (r2) and use custom install. Don't install software.
>Fix:
Looks like installer did not set up the registry correctly.
There is a key:
System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Apache\Parameters
but it contains no values.

State-Changed-When: Thu Feb 15 13:27:35 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Clearly the installation failed.  You may want to use the
Apache 1.3.17 product, since the installer used in 1.3.14
and prior is no longer maintained or supported.
