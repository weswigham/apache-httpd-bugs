>Environment:
I have apache v1.2b7 compiled on hpux 10.20.  Using all config files from hpux 10.20
environment, I run the web app on an hp9000/k570 running hpux 11.0 successfully.
In the httpd.conf file, user/group is set to name/group other than "nobody/#-1".
On an hp9000/V2200 running hpux 11.0, using the identical files, I am unable to start
up the httpd daemons.  In the httpd.conf, I have set user/group to every possible 
combination including "nobody/#-1" and "nobody/#-2".  It does not start-up.  Do 
you have any suggestions?

State-Changed-When: Thu Sep 17 10:37:12 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
We make it very clear before you submit a bug report
that we can not support ancient versions of Apache,
especially ancient betas.  Please upgrade to 1.3.1.

Your problem is probably related to not having the proper
entries for users in your passwd and/or gropu files, and
it would be useful for you to look at your error log, but
we can not try to help with this problem on 1.2b7 since
it just isn't worth our time finding old bugs over and over
with people using ancient versions.
