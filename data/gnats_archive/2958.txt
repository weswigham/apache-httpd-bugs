NetBSD rumolt.teuto.de 1.3G NetBSD 1.3G (RUMOLT) #0: Fri Aug 21 10:55:15 CEST 1998

Compiler: egcs-2.90.27 980315 (egcs-1.0.2 release)
>Description:
My server configuration includes (in srm.conf) the following lines:

---8<---
# UserDir: The name of the directory which is appended onto a user's home
# directory if a ~user request is recieved.

UserDir disabled root
UserDir public_html
--->8---

as suggested by the install documents. Now to try this I made a directory ~root/public_html and an index.html file there.

The effect is: request to (servername)/~root fail, but (servername)/~root/ works und gives the right index.html file.

You can call this pilot error, that's why I set the severity to non-critical.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
Either fix it (i.e. let the server return "access denied" for that URI) or document it. Sorry, no patches available.

 I can't replicate this.
 
 Are you sure it isn't being cached by your browser or by a proxy?  Are you
 sure you don't have any other userdir settings or rewrite settings that
 could be impacting this?

 Ooops...
 Must have been cached by my browser. I can't reproduce it myself now.
 
 Please close the PR,
 
 very sorry for the noise
