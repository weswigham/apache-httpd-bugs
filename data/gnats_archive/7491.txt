>Description:
shared libraries does not seem to get installed by normal Makefile path.
nor DSO moduels are. (sorry if this is configuration issue on my side).

as far as I undrstand, binaries built with libtool must be installed by using
"libtool --mode=install install foobar", not by "cp -p".
>How-To-Repeat:
make install, and see the log carefully.
>Fix:
for the second item, define INSTALL_foo properly in build/rules.mk or other place to the appropriate one.
always use ${INSTALL_PROGRAM} or ${INSTALL_SCRIPT}.
