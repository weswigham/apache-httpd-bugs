>Environment:
Windows Me (French), Apache (binary files win32), ie5
amd athlon 1000Mhz
>Description:
when I try to run apache in the cmd window, it does not work and the window closes itself. In the error-log file is written "[crit] makesock: failed to get a socket for port 80".
I don't understand because I just want to use apache local. I just have a modem that has never been connected to the wall and don't have other programs that could be used for internet except ie5.
(I have already changed the servername and the  you@you.com lines.)

Could tell me how to fix this problem.
Thank you.
Kevin
