State-Changed-Why:
Good grief, please give us _some_ information like what
error message you get when you try.  Reasons for it not
compiling could range from you not having a compiler properly
installed to you typing make wrong to their being a problem
with Apache.

Exactly what error message do you get when you try?

State-Changed-Why:
This looks like a problem with a gcc that's been built for
something other than 2.6 being used to compile something under 2.6...
at any rate it really doesn't look to be an apache problem.
You should try asking on a solaris newsgroup.
