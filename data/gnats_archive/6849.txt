>Environment:
Linux, but it doesn't matter - the problem is in the code
>Description:
Bug in autoindex code - if there is an absolute setting (no +/- prefix),
then any accompanying +/- setting in that directory is totally ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
IndexOptions FancyIndexing +SuppressColumnSorting

The SuppressColumnSorting setting will be ignored and the column headings
will still be hyperlinks.
>Fix:
Two lines of code seem to be missing in merge_autoindex_configs():

        else {
            /*
             * There are local non-incremental settings, which clear
             * all inheritance from above.  They *are* the new base settings.
             */
            new->opts = add->opts;;
        }

The new->incremented_opts and new->decremented_opts values are left undefined
here (actually 0), whereas they should be copied from add:

            new->incremented_opts = add->incremented_opts;
            new->decremented_opts = add->decremented_opts;

I'm not sure if they should be merged with the old {inc,dec}remented_opts -
the presence of an absolute option would imply that any previous relative
changes should be thrown out, too, so I think the above code should suffice.
