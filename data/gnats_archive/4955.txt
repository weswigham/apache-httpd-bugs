>Environment:
SunOS apollo 5.7 Generic_106541-02 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4

using gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I configured the server like so:

./configure --prefix=/WhereIWantItInstalled --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE

and ran apachectl start, httpd core dumped. I tried to get a trace, but
it wasn't reading the symbols so my trace would not be of much use.

I was able to get the above working when using SparcWorks cc 4.2

Maybe this is another gcc thing, but I thought I would report it anyway.
>How-To-Repeat:
Pretty much just do the above. 
>Fix:
Nope, didn't look at it long enough to debug it.
