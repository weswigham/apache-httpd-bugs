>Description:
I need to send information to a cgi program. I may need to send quite large 
amounts of data (maybe as much as 2MB). There is a default limit of 8K in the 
configuration files. If I change DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_LINE from 8190 to 1000000 I get a 
core dump.

Could you tell me what parameters I need to change to ensure that I can read the 
data and which will only take the memory as needed. If all buffers turn out 
to be 2MB it is going to consume all the memory very quickly.

Thanks

Peter

There is no parameter you can change to make the request line
that big.  In fact I don't understand how you intend this
to work -- no client will send a URL that long.  If you merely
want to change the size of the headers you're modifying the
wrong parameter... look for LimitRequest* directives at
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html

and there's no limit on the body size of a POST -- which is
a more appropriate method of sending such large requests.

 This is where I am having a problem. From having a look at the source,
 it looks as if it goes out of its way to limit the size of the
 incoming information. When I POST less than 8K, the transfer works
 successfully. When I post more, I get the error message
 
   "HTTP request sent, awaiting response... HTTP/1.1 414 Request-URI Too Large"
 
 The program receiving the information at the server end gives:
 REQUEST_METHOD = POST
 so I know that the method is correct.
 
 I cannot find any way to workaround this problem.
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter

 POST data do *not* go in the URI.  The only limit is on the
 length of the URI.  It sounds as though you're trying to
 send all of your data in the URL itself (hence the error),
 instead of in the message body where it belongs for POST
 requests.

 The method may be correct, but it sounds as though you're not
 using it correctly.

 It limits the incoming URI.  You can't use URIs more than about 512 bytes
 without messing up older browsers, so there are various practical limits.
 Apache will handle up to about an 8k URI.

 I don't understand how your POST is generating a huge URI.  This is
 outside Apache's control.  POST should generate a request body, and not
 change the URI.  Or perhaps your script is generating a massive URI in the
 action="" field.  If so, then I suggest you move some of the data in that
 URI into hidden fields.
