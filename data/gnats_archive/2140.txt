>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, Sun Ultra 1, Socks5-v1.0r5
>Description:
Adding support for socks5 is easy except for a few minor problems. In the Configure script, -lsocks needs changed to -lsocks5 and the -Dconnect=Rconnect
functions need changed to -Dconnect=SOCKSconnect. (Replace 'R' with 'SOCKS' on all the defines) Also at least one extra define needs added. -Dclose=SOCKSclose

SOCKS5 caches information about connections, so when apache gets a socket with 
the same file descriptor as one before, SOCKS5 thinks it's still open and returns EALREADY on the connect call. Redefining close fixes that.

Thanks for your SOCKS5 suggestions. We've added
SOCKS5 support now for 1.3b7 as you described.
Additionally a SOCKSinit is now done in main().
Thanks for your feedback.
