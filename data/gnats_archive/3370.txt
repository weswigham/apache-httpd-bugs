>Environment:
Solaris 2.6
JDK 1.1.5
JSDK 2.0
>Description:
1. In Apache-JServ-19981110/docs/index.html the link to  JavaSoft JSDK 2.0 API 
(http://java.sun.com/products/jsdk) is wrong. The correct URL is
http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.html

2. Also there is a very *small* correction to be made in the INSTALL file
of JServ-19981110 (I think it is an error).

  ./configure --with-apache-dir=/usr/local/src/apache_1.3.1
                   --enable-apache-conf -prefix=/usr/local/etc/httpd
                                        ^^^^^^
                               this should be --prefix, isn't it?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have included the corrections in the full description box.
