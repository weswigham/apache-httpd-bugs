>Description:

When I try to access a directory, and do not specify a file name,
httpd segfaults, with the following entry in the errorlog:
[Thu Mar 15 18:21:17 2001] [notice] child pid 9370 exit signal Segmentation Fault (11)

And the browser displays the error message:
The document contained no data

It doesn't appear to be a permissions problem, since specifying
the file name makes it work fine:
http://mysite.com		breaks
http://mysite.com/index.html	works fine 

relevant lines in httpd.conf are:
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.html
</IfModule>

I do have mod_dir enabled. 
I did try taking that out of the if statement, as well as changing
the default name, etc.

NOTE: this problem began just after compiling with mod_php (php 4.0.4pl1)

I have not found any comments regarding this problem in any apache or
php bug reports.

Thanks for any help.
Cheers,

 Updated note: I was wrong when I said that the problem began just
 after installing mod_php. Turns out (confirmed by performing the
 exercise of recompiling in with all possible combinations of
 mod_php on/off
 mod_perl on/off
 and mod_dir on every time
 That the observed behavior occurs always and only when mod_perl
 is present in the build.
