>Description:
Another suggestion made to NCSA's Brandon Long was implemented as an OnDeny
directive in auth configs.  The complete details of it are found here:

http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/access/OnDeny.html

It works much like ErrorDocument (though not as flexible).  Nonetheless,
it should be noted in the NCSA compatibility page.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I don't think this should be implemented, just documented.  ErrorDocument
provides better flexibility
