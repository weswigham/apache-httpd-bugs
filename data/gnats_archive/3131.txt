Introduction

This brief essay is a description of a membership model for an organization
collecting, configuring and distributing a GNU/Linux or similar free software
and open source software system for profit. My position is that a business model
similar to the ASCAP/BMI model for compensating music authors could be applied
to authors of open source software, GNU-style free software, and documentation
for such software, could provide some material compensation to said authors, and
could do so in complete compliance with the various authors' terms of release of
copyrights such as the GNU General Public License. 

This is also a de-facto solicitation for membership fees for what I believe is
the first attempt to form such a company. I call this newborn distribution
cLIeNUX. A small frail initial cLIeNUX exists at ftp blueznet.com/colorg .  The
organization does not yet exist, or consists only of me. I have no affiliations
or obligations impinging on the interests of such an organization. 

Purpose

The primary purpose of cLIeNUX is to make money for the ownership of cLIeNUX. 
Pursuant to this object, cLIeNUX is intended to provide value.  cLIeNUX is also
intended to provide a way to partially restrict how the value of cLIeNUX is made
available, so that fees can be realistically charged for full use of or
participation in cLIeNUX, while still allowing the entire contents of cLIeNUX to
be freely redistributable, modifiable and so on in accordance with the various
terms of release of copyrights of the various components of cLIeNUX.

Secondary purposes of cLIeNUX are to make a new-user-friendly open source unix,
a platform independant distribution, a unix which can be substantially learned
without any un-included documentation, a GNU/Linux which is defaulted for
client-side use of unix/internet functionality, and many other stylistic issues,
such as a /help directory and an html frontend to manpages and other
documentation, which will serve to differentiate cLIeNUX from existing
distributions, and thus hopefully serve the above primary purpose. 

Reasons

The idea for an ASCAP/BMI-like membership model for GNU GPL free software and
other open source materials predates my use of GNU/Linux. It is based on
problems I see with the current prevailing market mechanisms for single-user
software vis-a-vis the Forth programming language.  Forth comes from little
systems. It doesn't need to be liberated in the same ways as C and unix. It
already is. A typical implementation of the Forth programming language, or the
mental model I think most Forth programmers have of what "a Forth" is, is
inately open source at the (, virtual or not,) machine level. 

This inate openness limits Forth in the marketplace, in ways that now limit
software the GPL and less rigorous licenses have liberated. How do you make
money off it?  GPL is, as I read it, neutral on this problem. And this is a
problem, and is a basic freedom. I see the problem with openness as the symptoms
of the "cost" of open source software in reference to Forth, in that vendors
either avoid Forth altogether, or break it to varying degrees, or stay in
limited markets or special-purpose systems, in particular embedded systems. Free
Forths tend to be feature-lean and documentation-starved. I believe there are
analagous symptoms of the cost of free software in relation to other systems,
such as GNU/Linux systems.

With GNU/Linux the quality of documentation is mediocre. This is in some cases,
and I'm sorry if this is cynical, to sell books. Not only are books not free,
but online context sensitive help is better, although books also serve different
purposes in addition to what online help can do.

There appears to be a coming free software support industry. Or rather, there
may soon be a lot more Cygnuses. The Netscape guy says things along these lines,
and Bob Young says "support" is what Red Hat is about, at least he did to me at
Linux Expo. Making money off what goes wrong with your product, or what is
unclear about your information system product is, in theory anyway, a conflict
of interest. Selling support is perfectly reasonable with one or more CD's worth
of software, but it is still conceptually flawed. It is however, the best means
yet of getting around the prevailing idea that revenue on software is directly
dependant on keeping the sourcecode secret. cLIeNUX is another way to get
around this inefficient paradigm. 

My idea for a from-scratch Forth system scenario was to compensate contributors
on a per name-space entity basis. In Forth a namespace entity is a Forth "word",
which has similarites to various things in unix, including a command and/or a
linkable library routine. Now GNU/Linux more than eliminates the need to write
an OS, but the compensation issues are not so simple. Not nearly so. But the
top-down freedom of GPL and the bottom-up freedom of Forth would both benefit
from such a mechanism. Or several such mechanisms. If it makes money, imitators
will emerge. And eventually, better ideas. 

The membership model

The company, currently me, puts out an open-source GNU/whatever/Linux
distribution. The membership, nobody so far, pays $50-- a year to have access to
content discussions, other clubby perquisities, and most important, to qualify
for the contributor plowback fund.  The distribution itself is available, at the
very least, via the usual open source channels. The list of active members is
information which is available to the members, which thus means membership
revenue is known to the members. A declared percentage of membership revenues
are guaranteed to be redistributed to the members on the basis of percentage of
each member's total contribution to the cLIeNUX-specific content of cLIeNUX.
Since this is an experiment, and viability is the most important thing at this
point, I offer 20% of membership revenue for that portion of the fund. That's
probably low, but better to start low than high. I think that will be attractive
to many parties though, and may quickly become subject to competing entities
with different rates. Another portion, 5% of gross membership revenue, will go
to GNU/Linux related organizations or other beneficial entities. Plowback payout
will be quarterly. 

Parties within the "company" are not party to the plowback fund. The company
decides the content of the distro. Content proportions are on a raw-storage
basis. Pictures are the same percentage per byte as C code. This I think,
enforces the idea of the value of documentation. A file is the quantum of
compensatable authorship. For example, I am the author of xart, but xart is
a re-work of XPaint. I can claim full authorship, as far as cLIeNUX compensation
is concerned, of only a few files in the xart package. If I weren't party to the
cLIeNUX ownership, and if xart was included in cLIeNUX, and if I was a
paid member of cLIeNUX, then those files I am the sole author of would be
subject to cLIeNUX plowback compensation.

The Linux kernel and libc are recused from the compensation fund. This is to
protect the maintainers of these crucial pieces of a GNU/Linux from
ill-concieved patch submissions. This recusal may be extended to other system
components, particularly if requested by the author or accepted maintainer.

I have released parts of the current cLIeNUX with the stipulation that said
parts not be redistributed external to cLIeNUX as a whole. This will NOT be a
condition for qualification for plowback compensation. 

Other factors

The motive for membership is not so great, or economically direct, for someone
who has no intention of contributing to the compensatable body of cLIeNUX
contributions. cLIeNUX must remain available free of cost. However, if authors
of useful software and documentation join, and if cLIeNUX provides a mechanism
for interested parties to support near-direct compensation of free software
authors, I believe a viable level of revenue will occur. 

This setup seems to me to be for the most part GPL-neutral, and I believe it 
could help free software in some significant ways. Like a reasonably clear and
direct way for almost anyone to make a few bucks off almost any contribution.
And I've thought so for some time, but in the similar, but hypothetical
context of a Forth system.

I can make one other personal assurance. cLIeNUX will not adopt a form of
ownership that can be freely bought and sold to any large company. If any party
is interested in an equity position in cLIeNUX, shared ownership will be in a
closely held form apropriate for an independant consultancy.

cLIeNUX viability is dependant on a bit of cooperation from hackerdom. I ask
that the first shot at this be given to the guy who first proposed it. I feel
that to do so is in the interests of independant purveyors of intellectual
property. In fact, I'm asking you to send me fifty dollars. Please. I'll put the
membership list on my webpage as soon as it goes over zero.

I am very grateful to Richard Stallman for taking the time to discuss these
ideas with me. I am extremely proud of the fact that he described an earlier
description of this compensation model as "...a good idea." More general thanks
to all the parties making cLIeNUX possible will be in cLIeNUX itself.


I do appreciate your time.
