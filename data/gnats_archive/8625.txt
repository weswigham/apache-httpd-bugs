>Description:
When simultaneous accesses occur that are supposed to be processed by the Redirect command, the first one will be processed, and others with the same timestamp will get through.  I would expect that this problem also occurs with RedirectMatch,although I have not tried it.

Redirect commands I am using in .htaccess:
Redirect /scripts http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /winnt http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /nt http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /win_nt http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /system32 http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /MSADC http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /msadc http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /c http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /d http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /_mem_bin http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid
Redirect /_vti_bin http://www.WindowsIdiots.invalid

As you can see, the initial request of group of simultaneous requests, gets 302'd, but a following one will either get a 400 or 404.  They should ALL be redirected (302).  I have classified this as a serious problem since the server fails to perform an important function.  Although I am using it for trying to help cut down the stupid virus bandwidth usage, other uses on directories for high traffic servers could cause the redirect to fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Set up a server and give it a public DNS entry
2. Set up an .htaccess file with redirect for the windows virus as above
3. Wait for the accesses to come in (about a millisecond ;-) )

Suggestion for Generalized Testing:
This problem may be related to simultaneous requests from a single client.  Redirect may work OK when the simultaneous accesses are from unique clients, but I have no way of testing that.
>Fix:
Look for a hole in the request processing queue for multiple calls matching the redirect criteria from a single client, and check to make sure that it is not a problem with unique clients.  It seems like there is something with the Redirect where handling is ending up being modal which allows some requests to get through.

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a good way to test Redirect.  The worm is throwing requests that are deliberately designed to foul up request parsing.  Some of them are getting 400 (Bad request) responses, which is perfectly legitimate.  The ones that are getting 404 responses are probably correct also, although I'm not going to take the time to decompose that absurd URL according the the RFC rules.

If you can generate this problem with any real client sending real requests, please let us know.  Otherwise, you are really just wasting your time by sending redirects to a worm.  There is no way they will be followed.

Thanks for using Apache!

 I did some more testing by extracting the log entries one at a time and
 passing them in a URL.  It doesn't seem to be related to multiple execution
 as I first suspected.  It seems that the presence of varying character codes
 in the URL in the /..%[char code]../ section is what is causing the request
 not to be caught by the redirect.  So, it seems like the solution would be
 to do a more careful expression match during redirect parsing...

 hi,
 
 Thanks for the reply. I understand the inherent nature of the worm URLs I
 was sending.  However, the point of using redirect is to reduce bandwidth
 served by our servers, which have gotten literally thousands of badly-formed
 worm requests.  Not serving pages like a 404 or 400 page for those requests
 will save bandwidth.
 
 I have been able to reproduce the problem with a single request from a URL
 line using the log entries I sent (for the 400 or 404's).  Apache's string
 matching shouldn't fail, no matter what the circumstance, as long as the
 match string is present.  That is currently not the case.  Whatever
 expression matching Apache is using is obviously not sufficiently robust,
 since the Redirect is not working.  The source of the request shouldn't
 matter - worm or not.  The redirect expression matching is failing, and that
 should be cause enough for action.  String matching problems are some of the
 easiest ones to fix and if it improves overall robustness, it's a good
 cause.
 
 Also, by the way, it would be nice to be able to selectively omit those
 requests from the log.  My server logs are a mess.  I want to leave them set
 to the warn level, but Apache really needs an "OmitLog" directive that does
 the same thing that Redirect does to prevent specific accesses from clogging
 the logs with unwanted garbage, impairing their effectiveness.
 
 I really love Apache and think it is a great product.  Fixing redirect and
 adding an OmitLog command would really help make it impervious to stupid
 MS-based worms.  If there is some way to accomplish the OmitLog function in
 the current version, I'd love to know.
 
 Thanks for taking the time to reply.  I apreciate your help.  I know you
 guys must be busy, but I think in the current climate with MS Worms, these
 are very worthy bugs to address to improve server performance.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Davey Silon

 No it won't.  Serving a simple error page uses exactly the same bandwidth as
 serving a redirect.

 This is not simple string matching.  Apache must apply the RFC to
 canonicalize the URL before it deals with it.  If it cannot do this because
 the URL is malformed, then 400 is the only correct response.  Even if it can
 do it, the resulting URL may look different than what you image from looking
 at the uncanoncialized form, and therefore may not match your redirect.

 Please check the docs.  There is now extensive documentation on how to do
 selective logging.
 
 Further discussion on this would be welcome in a user support forum, but not
 in the bug database.
 
 Thanks!
