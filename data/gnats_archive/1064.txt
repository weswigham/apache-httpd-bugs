>Description:
Apache http server versions 1.2.4 and 1.2.1 are repeatly dumping core
with the following backtrace:

iaddr = 0x40e47c
hptr = 0xfb5af20
dir_conf = 0x10012288

For some reason current_conn is not set in the http_main.c timeout()
signal handler and the following jump is not run:

void timeout(int sig)                   /* Also called on SIGPIPE */
{
    char errstr[MAX_STRING_LEN];
    void *dirconf;

    signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);           /* Block SIGPIPE */
    if (alarms_blocked) {
        alarm_pending = 1;
        return;
    }
    
    if (!current_conn) { 
        ap_longjmp (jmpbuffer, 1);
    }


>How-To-Repeat:
Hard to say.  I've had sucess waiting the default timeout 300s after
killing a page during download.
>Fix:
I've tried increasing the timeout values, setting the server to process
only one request, changing the source to use the r stuct or the 
timeout_req struct, but all attempts have still resulted in core dumps.

Are you running it with a Servertype set to inetd or

   It's running in inetd mode.

 Sorry, haven't had time to respond.
 
 That is a known bug in Apache when using inetd mode.  There is another PR
 in the database on it somewhere that I think suggests a workaround, but
 I'm not convinced it is the proper one and haven't had time to look.  We
 really discourage you from using inetd mode if possible because it isn't
 very nice.
 
 Hopefully someone will get around to it soon.

State-Changed-Why:
The ap_setjmp patch (recently applied to 1.3) does the job.  It
should be backported for a possible 1.2.5.
