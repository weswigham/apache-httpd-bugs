Digital Unix (OSF1) V4.0 
>Description:
I cannot get the Virtual Host config to use a different ResourceConfig
from the main one.  The option just seems to be ignored.
No errors are generated.

I can successfully use this option outside of the VirtualHost config,
if I cut and paste the same line.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run up a server with a VirtualHost entry and try to specify 
a Resourceconfig within it.
eg:

<VirtualHost 130.102.300.300>
ResourceConfig conf/virtualsrm.conf
ServerName www.test.com.au
ServerAdmin root
DocumentRoot /home/julianne
ErrorLog logs/test_error_log
TransferLog logs/test_access_log
</VirtualHost>


The thing I'm trying to avoid is having the Alias entries in the main
config apply to the VirtualHosts.  It is an easy test if you have the main
one with an aliase and the virtual file without it and see if you can
get the alias to fail on the virtual address.

 Every configuration entry in srm.conf is set for the 'main server'
 and most configuration entries (Alias, DefaultType, <Directory> etc.)
 from the 'main server' are merged into _every_ virtual host.
 It is possible to define a new resource config for a virtual host,
 but you only override settings from the standard srm.conf. The
 configuration entries from your srm.conf file are still merged
 into the virtual host.
 
 To solve your problem you can create a "_default_" virtual host
 for your main server and move any configuration that is specific
 to the main server into the "_default_" virtual host section.
