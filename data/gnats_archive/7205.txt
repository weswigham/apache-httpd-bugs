>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux-2.2.16, gcc-1.1,2, but it does not matter really.
>Description:
If you use a line like this in jserv.conf:
ApJServMount /luser ajpv12://localhost:8008/luser /home/luser/secretfile
the third paramter (/home/luser/secretfile) gets ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to give a secret key with ApjServMount-directive. It gets ignored
and the global secret given with ApJServSecretKey gets used instead.
>Fix:
This patch against src/c/mod_jserv.c, which also saves 
the name of the secret key file (which is later checked 
by other parts of mod_jserv.so to check if secret key was 
given all):
