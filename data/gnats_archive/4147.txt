Looking at the source, it appears that the developers got part way through
conversion to a BSD replacement for crypt() but then punted on WIN32.  The
new file ap_md5c.c (not present in 1.3.4) is hard wired at line 603 to
reject all passwords in WIN32.  The changes notes ought to have pointed
this out.
