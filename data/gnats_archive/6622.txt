>Environment:
Apache bundled w/RedHat Linux 6.2
>Description:
When using Macintosh IE 5.0 with Director 7 shockwave movies to post form data (postnettext) to a Linux RedHat 6.2 Apache server generate an Invalid URI in Request message if the posts are less than 15 seconds apart.  If  there is 15 seconds or greater between posts, the message error does not occur.  The error does not appear to occur in PC browsers or Netscape for Mac.  The error also does not seem to appear with other web servers.  Usually, but not always, the message is preceded by a path similar to the following:

POST^M/cgi-bin/somedirectory/somescript.pl? Invalid URI in Request
>How-To-Repeat:
http://someserver.com/cgi-bin/somedirectory/somescript.pl?someparam=somevalue&someparam2=somevalue2
>Fix:
No.  Desperately need one!
