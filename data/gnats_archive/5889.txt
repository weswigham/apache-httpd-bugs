>Description:
The Makefile in ApacheJServ-1.1/src/java generates the ApacheJServ.jar file.
The list of filenames is created by "find . -name *.java", which emits
filenames with an extraneous leading "./", i.e., "./org/apache/jserv/JServ.class"
Now a given implementation of "jar" may surreptitiously remove those leading
dotslashes, but it is NOT supposed to - there is nothing in Suns' reference
DOCUMENTATION to suggest that it should.  Although you claim only to support
Sun's jdk, the one-line change below will solve this problem for everybody,
and get you away from depending on undocumented behaviors. Strip the leading ./!
>How-To-Repeat:
Build in the above environment.
>Fix:
Sure do, folks! And it's really easy! All ya gotta do is make this
one-line change (which I made to Makefile) to Makefile.in.
$ cd ApacheJServ-1.1/src/java
$ diff Makefile.orig Makefile

<               ${JAR} -cf ${ARCHIVE} `${FIND} . \( ${FINDSTRING} \) -print`; \
---
>               ${JAR} -cf ${ARCHIVE} `${FIND} . \( ${FINDSTRING} \) -print|${SED} -e s@^./@@`; \
