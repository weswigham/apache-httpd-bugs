>Environment:
This is running on Linux Slackware 7.0, with kernel 2.2.12
>Description:
When going to this URL:

http://www.kec.be/SiteFR/Pages/Français.htm

it says in browser that it cannot find:

The requested URL /SiteFR/Pages/FranÃ§ais.htm was not found on this server.

Log files say this:
  <access_log>
adsl-65-64-202-177.dsl.rcsntx.swbell.net - - [24/Feb/2001:13:54:21 -0600] "GET /SiteFR/Pages/Fran%C3%A7ais.htm HTTP/1.1" 404 299 "http://www.kec.be/" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98)"
  <error_log>
[Sat Feb 24 13:54:21 2001] [error] [client 65.64.202.177] File does not exist: /home/krein/htdocs/SiteFR/Pages/FranÃ§ais.htm

yet the URL is http://www.kec.be/SiteFR/Pages/Français.htm

I do not know why the server is doing this, and that file exists on the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
go to http://www.kec.be/SiteFR/Pages/Français.htm and you will see it.
>Fix:
I do not know... even the log files reports the same, yet the file IS there.
