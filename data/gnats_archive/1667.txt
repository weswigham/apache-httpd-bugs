>Environment:
N/A
>Description:
If the file specified by HeaderName is found as plain text (not html)
then the resulting page has a <PRE> in front of the preamble, instead
of after the preamble.
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem is obvious in the source...
>Fix:
Diff -c output for simple patch that fixes it.
It moves the <PRE> output after the preamble output.
