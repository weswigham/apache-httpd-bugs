>Environment:

SunOS 5.8 Generic_108528-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
./configure [--enable-log-config]

>Description:

The "%b" "%B" directives in LogFormat should indicate "-" or "0" for
HEAD requests, because no response body is sent --
but actually, the file size is logged.

This was because r->sent_bodyct flag, which tells logger to 
log r->bytes_sent, is set to 1 BEFORE checking & discarding the body in 
modules/http/http_protocol.c:ap_http_header_filter() .

Setting r->sent_bodyct AFTER checking for HEAD fixed it.

>How-To-Repeat:

* Setup a LogFormat with "%b" or "%B" within 
  (the default combined log is enough)
* Issue a HEAD request for a plain file.
* Examine the access_log.
  The 7th field (bytes transmitted) should be "-" or "0",
  but actually is the size of the file.

>Fix:

#
#****** modules/http/http_protocol.c HEAD logs full content bytes
#
# This patch fixes that "%b" "%B" (bytes sent, excluding response headers)
# directives for mod_log_config, is logged as full file size (should be zero).
