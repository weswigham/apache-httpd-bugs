>Description:
Mission-critical but lightly used server has been in use for several months. In three incidents starting Monday, Apache started going catatonic in response to a single request. In the previous two incidents it seems to have logged requests and occasionally fulfilled them, but in the third incident it did neither. All httpd processes except the original root one and the RemoteServerAdmin ones (working from a different config file) died, occasionally restarted and again died at once; in the third incident, there are "a long lost child came home" warnings for the original set of processes in the error log. During these failures, the RemoteServerAdmin invocation of httpd continues to work, as do other IP services such as ftp. 
There has been no change in configuration for a long time prior to the first incident. There is no obvious pattern as to the cause in user activity (only one or two active users on the server in each incident), the files accessed, or browsers used. I am trying to see whether increasing the number of general-purpose httpd processes fixes this, but found that /usr/local/sbin/apachectl seems not to obey the StartServers setting of httpd.conf, so I can only use MinSpareServers to do that. Please help.

State-Changed-Why:
There is nowhere near enough information here for us to 
be able to help you solve the problem. What was the request
that caused the crash? a file? a cgi? Was it the same client
each time? You should read the documentation about tuning
the capacity of your server: you don't seem to understand it
properly. I doubt this is a bug in the server -- that is
very unlikely to kill more than one apache process. If you
can't give us a reproducible test case we'll have to close
the bug.

 As I have stated in my original report, there is no obvious pattern. The
 items requested were all files, not cgi, but the files were different. The
 requests came from different clients (different versions of Netscape 4.x and
 MSIE 5.x on different computers). There has also been no recent change in
 the access pattern or configuration of any part of this system prior to
 these incidents. Apache 1.3.12 has been running problem-free for several
 months since I initially installed your binary distribution and configured
 it.
 
 Prior to writing to you, I have examined every conceivable parameter for a
 clue, and was unable to find one.. I have also searched your database and
 found a single submission that MIGHT be describing a similar problem
 (general/5838), but this lists no solution or diagnostic method applicable
 to me (since I'm running a precompiled binary I can't use gdb, and there
 seems to be no truss on this OS). I have also not been able to elicit any
 response on comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix or
 comp.infosystems.www.servers.mac. I have written to you as a last resort.
 
 I admit to not having read the part of the docs about tuning Apache's server
 capacity, because, with these minimal loads, I did not realize I needed to
 make tuning it a priority. I'm reasonably sure that the problem is not
 occurring because of excessive loads. I have added httpd processes simply as
 a way (possibly incorrect and almost certainly ineffective) to leave some
 alive. I will read the capacity tuning docs, but without guidance and in
 relative ignorance of Apache, I have made the assumption that my problem is
 not related to this issue.
 
 As you must know, not all legitimate problems are easily reproducible. To
 reproduce something, one must understand something about the conditions in
 which it occurs, and I have very little in the way of such understanding
 now. However, I fully expect the problem to reappear on my server, and will
 gladly cooperate in supplying you with any information you want. I would
 appreciate any help you can provide.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, but without any identifiably specific symptoms there's
no way we can start working out where the problem is. (If
loading your machine in other ways causes similarly odd
problems in other software I would point my finger at the
hardware.) Since there's nothing we can do I'm closing this
bug.

 I was not hoping that, without reproducible symptoms, you'd be able to solve
 the problem. I would be grateful, however, for any guidance in terms of
 obtaining more information on what is happening there; for example, a
 history of the various httpd processes.
