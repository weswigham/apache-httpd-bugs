>Environment:
SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1 (C compiler)
>Description:
I get upon compiling and trying to run Apache 1.3.0 is:

[Thu Jun 11 11:26:55 1998] [error] (24)Too many open files: unable to open a file descriptor above 15, you may need to increase the number of descriptors

I know this is not a compilation "error" or sw-bug, but is directly related to Solaris.  In previous version of Apache (currently still running 1.2.5) the only mods made to the Configuration to get around this were:

EXTRA_CFLAGS= -O -DHIGH_SLACK_LINE=256

However, compiling with (or without) this on 1.3.0 still yields the above error (using my current httpd.conf - one that works with 1.2.5) file, which may be the problem although the description doesn't lead me that way.  I can get it up and running
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The above attempt (adding EXTRA_CFLAGS= -O -DHIGH_SLACK_LINE=256) does not seem to change the behavior.  I am more interested to know if anyone else is running 100+ virtual hosts using 1.3.0 and Solaris 2.5.1 (I did post to the newsgroup and have done a repost with a different subject today in hopes of catching more info).

 You are using the "old" Configure interface and not the new apaci
 configuration, right?

 Yes I am.
 
 Again, not sure what you have been informed of, but 1.3.0 compiles fine and 
 actually runs fine when it doesn't have 100+ servers in the httpd.conf file 
 :)
 
 Thanks in advance for your time and any additional thoughts you may have.
 
 Joe...

State-Changed-Why:
If you have 100+ vhosts in your configuration files, how
many CustomLog/TransferLog/ErrorLog/ScriptLog entries
do you have?  If you have lots of CustomLog or TransferLog
directives, one thing that may help reduce your usage is
to combine them all into one CustomLog reference that
includes "%v" (for the vhost identity) at the beginning
of the format string.  This will label each access with
the vhost involved and use only one file descriptor instead
of N.  You can use a tool such as src/support/split-logfile
(or something similar) to later split the combined logfile
into separate ones for all the vhosts.  See the FAQ for
details.  Of course, if this doesn't address your problem,
"never mind."

You could even use the reliable piped logs in 1.3.0 to
do the logfile splitting in real time with something
like

LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b" Combined-CLF
CustomLog "|src/support/split-logfile" Combined-CLF

 That's a warning that was added to help folks diagnose when they're too
 close to the file descriptor limit.  I suppose it should say [warn], eh? 
 1.2.x don't give the warning even though they may be that close as well.
