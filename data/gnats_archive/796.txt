>Environment:
my user name is nroark at ezin.net I need to go in as pool and now changed back to the dns #'s instead of recognizeing pool now i can not even get on apache it took 6 months the last time to straighten this problem out hope it does not take even 3 days this time.
>Description:
Since the adresses changed from pool to the numbers i give above or below i still can not get on apache I need this server bad haveing a 20 min lag on the other server I have to go through and can't op.
>How-To-Repeat:
You guys had switched it to where pool as our address would get on now it went back to like
207.16.117 and now i can not get on apache I live in oklahoma,city its not our net My provider is Ezin.net out of guthrie,oklahoma
they say its farther down the line This is very important please check this out I'm an op on two channels and can not op the the dns # went from poool to what I explained earlier I need to run 9 meeting a week and its hell when you are the only op at that hour and cant do a damm thing.
>Fix:
Yes find out why in the hell the adress chang went from pool to 207.16.117 this is a pain in the but right now.
if you email anyone at ezin.net like donh@ezin.net he is an owner he will explain the problem,please check this out as fast as possible.
