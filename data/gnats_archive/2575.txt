we had the same environment (and problem). it seems that ther is a
problem with the ap_assert macro. after changeing it (see below)
and recompile the server starts und runs as expected. 

in src/include/httpd.h

change the line (around source line 1000):

#define ap_assert(exp) (void)( (exp) || (ap_log_assert(#exp,__FILE__,__LINE_ _), 0) )

to:

#define ap_assert(exp) ((exp) ? (void)0 : ap_log_assert(#exp,__FILE__, __LINE__))
                                                               
hope this helps
