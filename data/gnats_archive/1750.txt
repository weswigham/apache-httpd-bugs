Details of environment aren't really relevant.
>Description:
Configure doesn't give help, and doesn't allow you to specify which compiler 
to use.

Not a bug, but searching through src/* and this site failed to yield
an address like "patch-submit@apache.org".
>How-To-Repeat:
As above.
>Fix:
This adds "-cc" and "-help" (and "-h" and "--help", etc.).

cheers,

State-Changed-When: Sat Jan 31 13:26:03 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
There's apache_1.2.5/README, apache_1.2.5/src/INSTALL, and
apache_1.2.5/src/PORTING ... and there's also
http://www.apache.org/docs/install.html.  In short there's
a bunch of documentation, I'm really not sure how you missed
it.  Submitting patches to the bugdb is fine, and the PORTING
file lists new-httpd@apache.org as a place to send ports.

CC is already configurable in the Configuration file so we don't
need to add it as an option to Configure.

But adding --help for Configure is fine, thanks for the patch.
