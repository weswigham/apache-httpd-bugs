>Environment:
SunOS Release 4.1.2
Netscape 2.0 / 3.1 on Linux 
>Description:
A .htgroup file which worked fine on NCSA HTTPD 1.5.2 caused strange
authentication errors on Apache 1.1.1.

Authentication was refused to an authorized user with no error message in
the error log.

Apache requires a carriage return at the end of a group line in a .htgroup, 
whereas NCSA does not.  This should be mentioned on the NCSA<-->Apache 
compatibility page, and an error sent to the error file.

>How-To-Repeat:
Create a .htgroup file with a single line as follows:
.htgroup:
____________
students: bob mary sam

but don't add a carriage return at the end.
Create a directory user Basic user authentication and try to authenticate a 
user.  Even if Sam is in the .htpasswd he will not be authorized (Netscape2.0 
and 3.1) and no error will be sent to error log.
>Fix:
Just mention it on the incompatibilities page and make sure that an error
is sent to the log when it does occur. It took me 2 hours to isolate because
no error was being raised.

State-Changed-Why:
All versions of Apache before 1.2b1 ignored the lastline of configuration files if the final newline wasomitted. This included the group file, as well as the normalconfiguration files (httpd.conf, etc).The solutions are to add a trailing newline or upgrade to1.2 beta or later.
