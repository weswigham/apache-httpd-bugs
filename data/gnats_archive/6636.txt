>Description:
To see if an httpd is already running, apachectl simply looks at the httpd.pid
file and then 'kill -0's that process to make sure it still exists.  This is
insufficient.  Last night we had a power outage and when our machine came back
up httpd was not restarted because some OTHER process existed with httpd's old
PID.  It took manual intervention to get the webserver back up. 

apachectl should use ps and egrep to ensure that the PID in the PID file is
actually an httpd invocation.  I have provided a patch to make it do this.  I 
have attempted to make it as platform-independent as the 'kill -0' version.
>How-To-Repeat:
Note httpd's PID.  Issue 'apachectl stop'.  Manually write httpd's old PID back 
to the PID file (to simulate non-graceful-shutdown).  Issue 'apachectl start'. 
httpd will not start.
>Fix:
Yes, here's a patch:
