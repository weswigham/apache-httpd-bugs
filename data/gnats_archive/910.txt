>Description:
No core dumps or errors. When I attempt to run a script (arweb) from my new ScriptAlias directory,
all I get is the script content, as if the server was reading a text file. I have checked
the config files and I have specified the following:

In srm.conf
Alias /icons/ /data/httpd/icons/
Alias /ars /usr1/ar/arweb/data

# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
# Format: ScriptAlias fakename realname

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /data/httpd/cgi-bin/
ScriptAlias /ars/cgi-bin /usr1/ar/arweb/cgi-bin


In access.conf

<Directory /usr1/ar/arweb/cgi-bin>
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

If I move the arweb script to the default cgi-bin directory, it executes correctly.
Also my Alias to /ars woks correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
Test as above?

State-Changed-Why:
Try putting the ScriptAlias /ars/cgi-bin before the Alias /ars.
The alias module uses only the first match, and /ars matches
before /ars/cgi-bin.
