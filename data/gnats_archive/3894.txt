>Environment:
I use Windows 95, running Apacher 1.3.4.
>Description:
When I un-comment the LoadModule proxy_module modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll line under the config file, it will give me a syntax error when starting the Apache server.  I use a LAN and I want to give access to other computers through the server so more than one person can be on the net.  It says that it cannot load the module into the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Un-comment the line
>Fix:
no
