IE6 and Opera 5.12
>Description:
When hyperlink on the page in either IE6 or Opera5.12 is clicked that will open NEW browser page then that page remains blank and browser show status 'Done'.
If I restart Apache then for a while it is workind fine.
I don't know if it is issue with Apache or both browsers.

State-Changed-Why:
It sounds like those hyperlinks use client-side script,
which you may have disabled.  In any case, this does not
appear to be an Apache server problem, but a problem with
the client or the href's used to create the links.
