>Description:
Starting at line 327 of INSTALL, it says:
         Note 1: The --enable-shared option DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY enable the
                 module because there are variants like `--enable-shared=all'
                 which should not imply `--enable-module=all'.  

This produces the following error:
$ ./configure --enable-shared=all
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.6
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
configure:Error: No such module named 'all'

In README.configure however it says (circa line 154):
  APACI also supports a variant of the --enable-shared option:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/apache \
                  --enable-shared=max
    $ make
    $ make install

  This enables shared object building for the maximum of modules...

Is the description in INSTALL incorrect?
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --enable-shared=all
>Fix:
Replace the occurrance of "--enable-shared=all" in INSTALL with "--enable-shared=max"
