The following pages should be updated to mention the newsgroup
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows:

http://www.apache.org/info.html
http://www.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#what2do

Hopefully this will reduce the number of windows questions posted in the
unix group and resulting flames.
