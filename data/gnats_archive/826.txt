State-Changed-Why:
I can see no such problem looking at the page you reference. 
Apache does not set what is displayed in the Location: 
field in Netscape.  

Frames can cause the client to display unexpected things 
there.

1.1.x is no longer supported.  You could try upgrading to
1.2.x, but that is very unlikely to fix your problem as 
it is almost certainly a problem in your HTML or in the client.
