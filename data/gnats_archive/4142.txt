NT 4.0 SP4
>Description:
The authentication for a directory doesn´t work like in version 1.3.4. The error-log
contains this message:
[Fri Mar 26 12:38:53 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] user Schulze: authentication failure for "/Buch/index.html": crypt() unavailable on Win32, cannot validate password

For version 1.3.4 the password must be in plain text in the user-file. What shall I do now?
>How-To-Repeat:
We use Apache on WIN 32 only in the Intranet for testing

State-Changed-Why:

Yes, I'm afraid that plaintext passwords were inadvertently
broken with 1.3.6.  This is described in last week's
ApacheWeek issue (<http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/99-03-26>).
If you encrypt your passwords with the support/htpasswd.exe
application, they should work again.
