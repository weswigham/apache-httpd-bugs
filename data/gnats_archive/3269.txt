>Description:
I compiled an java applet and put it in the server.  When I visit from browser,
The GIF contained in the applet could not appear. but in NT + IIS 3.0, I use 
the same java script. it looks good.

I just wonder why.

the GIF is located at:

State-Changed-Why:
You know, looking at the error logs LIKE WE ASK would make
this much easier on everyone.  It would make it obvious that
your java applet was asking for Ch1-01.gif, which doesn't
exist on the server, instead of Ch1-01.GIF, which does.
