>Description:
I get this error message


local package initilization failed line 3 invalid local host freyr.exolution.lan .. says it is on line 3 of server file, I check httpd.conf and I don't see it, I check my /etc/hosts , and it is set-up file, my hostname is valid. I can't seem to find apache running anywhere else on the machine, if it was, where would it go? I did my top and saw nothing. Any help would be greatly welcomed.


                                                               Thank you
