>Description:
While explaining the Apache config files to someone I'm doing consulting for, we ran across:

# Number of servers to start --- should be a reasonable ballpark figure.

and, even though he speaks English reasonably well (I live in Italy), he was confused by the term 'ballpark'.  Indeed, as far as I know, it's an americanism.   Using the 'dict' program distributed with my Linux distribution, I was infact not able to find the meaning of the word as used above.  
>How-To-Repeat:
It's in the documentation...
>Fix:
A more appropriate phrase might be "should be a reasonable estimate" or something of that ilk.
