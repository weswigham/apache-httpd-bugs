Windows 2000 SP1/Novell Client 4
>Description:
This is a question rather than a problem report.  I am running Apache as a service and I know that I cannot use "localsystem" user because it does not have access to network drives.  I have created a new user and assigned the user to the service and set the "user logon as service" rights.  I have also included the new user in the Novell users list and assigned all the proper rights thru Novell. The documentroot is set to a directory on the Novell server, but index.htm cannot be found. I also have scripts etc. on the Novell server and have set up all the alaises in the .conf for them, but I havn't gotten that far.

My questions are: (1)What I have I missed? (2) What should the documentroot param look like "//server/disk/directory/" ?

Thanks
