Sorry. You won't have to anymore, though, having done it once.
My mailbox signal:noise ratio would be about 1:20 if I didn't

Ok.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stddef.h>

extern char *strdup();

main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char **argv;
{
  struct post_env_list *list;
  int pid;

  printf("Content-Type: text/html\n\n");

  if ((pid=vfork())==0)
  {
    freopen("/dev/null","w",stdin);
    freopen("/dev/null","w",stdout);
    freopen("/dev/null","w",stderr);
    exit(0);
  }
  else
    waitpid(pid,NULL,0);

  printf("<head><title>Page sent</title>\n");
  printf("</head><body><H1>Page sent.</H1></body>\n");
}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 11 Sep 1997 22:18:46 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3a1
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

Content-Type: text/html

<head><title>Page sent</title>
</head><body><H1>Page sent.</H1></body>
