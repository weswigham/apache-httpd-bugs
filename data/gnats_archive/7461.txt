>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux kernel 2.4.0
>Description:
The response headers are not logged when mod_proxy serves the document. This is because proxy writes them directly to the output and doesnt add them to the request->headers_out table. And mod_log_config parses request->headers_out for {}o log directives..
>How-To-Repeat:
Every document accessed through proxy... :))
>Fix:
Yes, add response headers to request->headers_out table in ap_proxy_send_hdr_line in proxy_util.c:
...
if (!parm->req->assbackwards)
  ap_rvputs(parm->req, key, ": ", value, CRLF, NULL);

// Here comes the fix...
ap_table_add(parm->req->headers_out,key,value);
...
