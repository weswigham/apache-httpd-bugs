>Environment:
Sun Sparc 5, Solaris 2.6, used Sun cc
>Description:
Just upgraded from Sun IPC, Sol 2.4 with Apache, don't know the version,
to Sun Sparc 5, Sol 2.6 with Apache 1.3.3, compiled with Sun cc 4.2.
Going through an httpproxy on a Sun IPC, Sol 2.4, with Cern httpd_3.0.

No errors in Apache error logs, no problems with any web pages, but archive
files of zip, gz, Z formats get a bad CRC when downloaded. When I download
from the command line through an ftpproxy, another Sun IPC with Sol 2.4, all
those archives are OK.
