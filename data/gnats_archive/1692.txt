 Jan 17 22:29:41 valis pserver[8665]: warning: host name/address mismatch: 206.98.165.103 != datacom.net
 Jan 17 22:29:41 valis pserver[8665]: refused connect from 206.98.165.103

 Your DNS is broken.  The first one has bogus reverse DNS (reverse entry
 for 206.98.165.103 points to datacom.net, but datacom.net does not point
 to 206.98.165.103) and the second doesn't have reverse DNS.
 
 You need proper reverse DNS to be able to connect.
