>Description:
When accessing a ftp site via the ftp proxy and downloading a binary image, the
binary image is coorupted with extra CR characters embeded in the file.

FTP proxy code is patched with LF corrections patches from bug report # 2412 and
additional patches listed in the Jul 1 developers tar file.

Accessing the file direct (without apache ftp proxy) the file is of total length
6118 bytes

Accessing the file using the apache ftp proxy, the file increases to 61345 bytes.

Dumping the file (od -x) I noted the following character string differences

File without proxy ....

120c 0b0a 0a0b 1710

File with proxy .....

120c 0b0d 0a0d 0a0b 1710

Note the extra 0d characters inserted into the file.

>Fix:
Suspect strongly that the problem lies in bwrite (main/buff.c).  That routine
always attempts to add CRLF to the end of each buffer write.  This is called from
ap_proxy_send_fb which is called from proxy_ftp.c.

The problem, I believe, originates in ap_proxy_send_fb (called from proxy_ftp
when it start to pump data from the incomming connection and sends it both to 
the cache and the output connection. (see lines 466-490).

ap_proxy_send_fb calls ap_bwrite - once for the cache output and a second time
to transmit the data to the client.  ap_bwrite then calls the bwrite routing which 
I suspect is doing the real damage.

The concept of adding CR/LF should be examined to ensure it is correct. 

These should be binary transfers - no special processing required (other than the
desired buffering for the cache files).

 Further testing has identified the following data relevant to this bug
 report.  First, my first suspicions regarding bwrite are incorrect.  That
 routine seems to be operarting properly.
 
 What I determined is the following.
 
 Apache atempts to determine the type of document being retruned to the
 client.  On FTP sites, it executes the following set of instructions in
 proxy_ftp.c
 
 
   1010      else {
   1011      if (r->content_type != NULL) {
   1012          ap_proxy_add_header(resp_hdrs, "Content-Type",
 r->content_type,
   1013                   HDR_REP);
   1014          Explain1("FTP: Content-Type set to %s", r->content_type);
   1015      }
   1016      else {
   1017          ap_proxy_add_header(resp_hdrs, "Content-Type",
 "image/jpeg", HDR
 _REP);
   1018      }
 
 
 normally, line 1017 is set to text/plain.  For this experiment, I had it
 default to image/jpeg.  When set this way, jpeg images are properly
 displayed.
 
 This would seem to indicate that some browser implementations then modify
 the incoming stream based on the content type.  In my case, netscape 4.05
 added the cr characters with the download.  By having apache default to
 image/jpeg, netscape behaved better and properly displayed the image.
 
 So now, the problem focuses on why didn't apache properly determine the
 content type - and set the headers appropriately.
 
 I will look into that next.  If any of you have good ideas, please direct
 my research.

 Do you have your mime.types file on the proxy configured correctly to
 recognize .gif files?

 Marc,
 
 Did some more testing based on your input.  I initailly had deselected the
 following modules....
 
 mod_mime,
 mod_mime_magic,
     and
 mod_negotiation.
 
 I reconfigured the proxy server with these modules now defined ... removed
 my temporary mods... and initial testing seems to indicate that it does
 now determine the content type correctly.  If I understand your initial
 response, probably all three of these modules are required.
 
 Let me know if you have any additional pointers....
 
 thanks for the pointers so far...

 Yes.  It has to determine the MIME type in some way since the ftp server
 doesn't tell it.  It does that by looking at the MIME types file.  The
 default type has to be text for anything not listed, otherwise all sorts
 of readme files wouldn't be easily viewable.
