>Description:
This problem results in blank JPEG image in a Java signed applet.
It may be related to bug #3794.

Our applet attempts to determine if a JPEG image is available by 
opening a URLConnection to the server and testing the Content-Length.
If the JPEG is available, it then starts over and downloads the Image.
Sometimes this procedure works, but if many of these downloads are
quickly requested, the image is cut off.  The httpd_access_log with
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b A=%{Accept}i Im=%{If-Modified-Since}i Ir=%{If-Range}i R=%{Range}i"
shows entries like this:

205.162.51.85 - - [10/Dec/1999:16:18:53 -0800] "GET /palace/media/DeerCave.jpg HTTP/1.0" 200 32768 A=image/gif, image/x-xbit\

tmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */* Im=- Ir=- R=bytes=18690-

The error_log (with LogLevel debug) shows:

[Fri Dec 10 16:18:53 1999] [info] [client 205.162.51.85] (32)Broken pipe: client stopped connection before send mmap complet\
ed

There are also entries:

[Fri Dec 10 16:19:49 1999] [warn] child process 23112 still did not exit, sending a SIGTERM
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the Netscape browser on Windows.  (I have not been able to reproduce
this problem with Internet Explorer.)  Goto the URL:

http://www-int.communities.com/~frantz/hodagtest.html

or, if there are certificate problems use:

http://www.thepalace.com:8000/perl/palentry.pl?ID=E6XNVQ42

This will download a signed applet.  Once the applet is downloaded,
move quickly thru the rooms.  When you return, some of them will 
be totally black instead of showing an image.
>Fix:
No, I'm an Apache virgin, but I am willing to try to provide more 
information if you need it.  This httpd is running in a test system,
so changes and specific debugging will not greatly impact other
users.
