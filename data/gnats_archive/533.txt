When giving CGI programs arguments on the command line they are not sent to the program.

I.e :
Calling a CGI-scrit :

http://internal.eunet.se/cgi-bin/test-cgi?hej=hopp&hopp

Results in : 

CGI/1.0 test script report:

argc is 0. argv is .

SERVER_SOFTWARE = Apache/1.2b10
SERVER_NAME = internal.eunet.se
GATEWAY_INTERFACE = CGI/1.1
SERVER_PROTOCOL = HTTP/1.0
SERVER_PORT = 80
REQUEST_METHOD = GET
HTTP_ACCEPT = image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*
PATH_INFO = 
PATH_TRANSLATED = 
SCRIPT_NAME = /cgi-bin/test-cgi
QUERY_STRING = hej=hopp&hopp
REMOTE_HOST = kurtis.eunet.se
REMOTE_ADDR = 195.43.226.130
REMOTE_USER =
AUTH_TYPE =
CONTENT_TYPE =
CONTENT_LENGTH =

That is with no arguments. The same if I write a small perl script to print all that is on the  command line, 
it shows nothing.

State-Changed-Why:
That is how it's supposed to behave according to the CGI spec.
If the QUERY_STRING contains any equal sign then no argv is
created.  The use of the argv array is actually deprecated,
and you should use the QUERY_STRING itself (which is always
present).

Thanks for using Apache!
