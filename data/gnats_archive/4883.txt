getServletPath will return only the name of the servlet zone if the requested
url contains the name of the servlet a second time.
>How-To-Repeat:
servlet zone: servlet
servlet name: foo
url 1: /servlet/foo/blah
url 2: /servlet/foo/blah/foo

for url 1 getServletPath() returns "/servlet/foo" <--CORRECT
for url 2 getServletPath() returns "/servlet"     <--INCORRECT
