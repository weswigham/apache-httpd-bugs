>Organization:
>Environment:
FreeBSD 4.3 on i386, Linux
>Description:
Iff mime_magic_module is enabled, and you have little-endian data
(might be some other data types too, but I came across this one):

# file data
data: RIFF (little-endian) data

You _always_ get a 500 internal server error when you try to access the file.

Turning mime_magic off fixes this.

>How-To-Repeat:
Download the data example (server has mime_magic disabled) from:

http://www.netcore.fi/pekkas/riff_data

and try.
>Fix:
Enhance mime_magic to be more robust somehow ;-)

State-Changed-Why:
(Note: I have been researching this problem using Apache 2.0,
though I think it should be the same in 1.3.)

A simple work-around appears to be to remove the tab character 
at the end of the line

0	string		RIFF		audio/unknown

in the magic file.  I think the parser of the file
mistakenly stores the tab character as part of the mime
type.  At run-time, we've selected this mime type
("audio/unknown\t") but we don't store it in the request
because when parsing it again we are confused by the tab.

Changes contemplated for Apache 2.0 include

1) log something!  an internal server error generated from
   an Apache module with no error log is nasty
2) remove such tabs from the distributed magic file and/
   or add logic to the file parsing code to ignore the tabs

Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache!

FYI: a fix was committed to 2.0 but not to 1.3, as far as I
can tell
