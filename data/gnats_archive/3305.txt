Redhat Linux 4.2, gcc, normal Linux setup
>Description:
We can no longer receive any apache guardian messages for our virtual servers, also we can no longer have links that do not end with a slash "/" either otherwise the browsers try to connect as if they were on a LAN.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just go to any of our virtual servers (www.imageplaza.com) . I do have the ServerAdmin Defined for each one.  Unless this has changed in 1.3.1 which I could not find in the faq or database.

State-Changed-Why:
First, I have no idea what "Apache Guardian" is or what
it does, so I'm afraid I can't help you with that unless
you tell me what it is supposed to do.

Second, you need to set the ServerName directive in your
config (as sortof mentioned in the FAQ), since for whatever
reason your server can't automatically determine the
proper hostname.  Well, either that or you already have the
ServerName directive set to a bogus value; it has to be a
domain name.

 It is not a program that comes with Apache.  It must be some third
 part software; you have to find it and follow its installation 
 instructions, probably involving installing it as a CGI script
 then setting appropriate ErrorDocument directives.

[This is a standard response.]
This problem report has nothing to do with the Apache
software.
