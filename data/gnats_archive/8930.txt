The system is actually a 420R.
Don't know what compiler was used, but I don't think this has any relevance.
>Description:
When the pipe symbol is omitted from the CustomLog entry when using the rotatelogs utility, a graceful restart fails but reports success.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add or modify the CustomLog entry as follows...

CustomLog "/path/to/apache/bin/rotatelogs /path/to/apache/log/access_log 86400" common

Gracefully restart apache

/path/to/apache/bin/apachectl graceful

Check for apache

ps -ef | grep httpd

It isn't there.
>Fix:
The syntax checker logic passes this configuration as OK, so I would suggest that as a good place to start.  If I ever get the chance, I might take a look at the code myself, as it is version 1.3.19 and not the latest 2.0.
