>Description:
I have a pair of matching machines, matching versions of Apache.
The FEM (front-end machine) has the following directives:

  ProxyPass         /secure/reports http://[host2]/bem
  ProxyPassReverse  /secure/reports http://[host2]/bem

Users go to FEM/secure/, where they are authenticated against a .htaccess file.
They are then redirected to FEM/secure/reports/ and a cookie is set.

The redirect is issued, and the browser goes to the new URL.  The proxying
is successful, but the perl script at http://[host2]/bem/ does not indicate
that it ever received the cookie.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, I don't have root on any external systems to provide an example.
Make 2 machines.  One proxies to the other.  One sets a cookie with a path of '/'.
It then 302 redirects to a ProxyPass URI.  The BEM, which is pretending to be
FEM/some/path/ (a URI that should have access to the cookie) never receives the
cookie in its proxy call.

Pass 'em?  :-)
