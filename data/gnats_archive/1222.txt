>Description:
I'm using the Proxy module with user authentication. Host based is no problem, 
but User/Password-based requests a password for every different host I want to
access.

<Directory proxy:*>
AuthType Basic
AuthName Proxy
AuthUserfile /etc/proxyuser.passwd
require user
</Directory>

I want a password for the access to the proxy, not for every single host I want
to browse.

State-Changed-Why:
You can't do that in 1.2.  It uses a normal authentication
header to ask for auth, so it is the client that demands
you enter the password again for each site.

In 1.3 this will be changed so it specifically uses
the proxy-authentication header to avoid this, and other
problems.
