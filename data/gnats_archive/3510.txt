>Description:
according to the documentation, if a #exec cgi returns
"Content-type:text/x-server-parsed-html" in its result, then
THE RESULT should be parsed ALSO.

well, the bad thing it's not. :(
>How-To-Repeat:
create a cgi (let's call it "sample.pl") that gives an output like this:
[-- 8< --]
Content-type:text/x-server-parsed-html

<!--#include virtual="/file2.shtml" -->
[-- 8< --]

let's have a file "1.shtml"
[-- 8< --]
...
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/sample.pl" -->
...
[-- 8< --]

and a file "/file2.shtml"
[-- 8< --]
...
this is file 2
...
[-- 8< --]

(let's pretend we mean all the html headers instead of "..." above).

when you request "/file1.shtml", you should be given an output that
contains the text "this is file 2". instead, you get something that
contains "<!--#include virtual="/file2.shtml" -->". that is wrong.

have no idea. haven't seen the sources (i'm not as good in c).

Nope, the documentation does not say that.

The output of CGIs is never parsed fro SSIs by Apache.  This
is detailed in the FAQ.

 dear marc,

 yes, it says. please read carefully
 "http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html".
 
 i quote:
 "For backwards compatibility, documents with mime type
 text/x-server-parsed-html or
 text/x-server-parsed-html3 will also be parsed (and the resulting
 output given the mime type text/html)."
 
 so, my script returns "Content-type:text/x-server-parsed-html". and it
 is NOT PARSED.

 why should one care where was the document got from? yes, it has that
 mime type, and according to the dox, it SHOULD be parsed.
