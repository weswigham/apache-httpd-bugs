>Description:
To pass the proxy error messages via an cgi environment variable to 
an error handler script is a great idea.

But to customize the error handling (e.g. german language) it would
be very helpfull to have an error code for these (proxy error) messages 
available.  (e.g. for mapping to non english error messages)

An CGI variable  REDIRECT_ERROR_NR (or something like that) containing the
error code for the message would be nice...

State-Changed-Why:

Doesn't the REDIRECT_STATUS envariable provide you with
what you want?  E.g., "404" in the case of a "not found"
error?

State-Changed-Why:

*ERROR_NOTES has been enhanced somewhat to contain
information in more cases.

User reports that *REDIRECT_STATUS provides the desired
functionality.
