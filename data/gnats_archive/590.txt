IRIX 6.2 03131015 IP22
>Description:
I have 163 AccessLog or ErrorLog directives in my httpd.conf (82 virtual servers).
If I add one more of these directives, CGI scripts cease to work. The server 
closes the connection without sending any data. The script is never called (verified
by adding logging to the beginning of the script, and by putting in a sleep() 
and looking for the script in the output of ps -ef). This applies to PERL scripts
as well as binaries.

However, the logging as specified in the last AccessLog or ErrorLog directive
does work correctly. All html pages are served correctly.

It does not matter which directive I add, or to which virtual server.

This has been tried using buth Apache 1.2b8 and 1.1.

Bizzare! Is the server running out of file descriptors?
>How-To-Repeat:
Hmmm I think you'd have to set up 82 virtual servers and try it. I couldn't put
in the extra directive that breaks the scripts for anything more that a few
minutes without inconveniencing clients.
>Fix:
If it's a file descriptor problem, can more be compiled in%3

State-Changed-Why:
It sounds as though this is probably a file limitation.
Please check out <http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ#fdlim>
and see if it helps identify the specific cause.
