>Description:
Many modules (mod_session, mod_jserv, etc.) create their own unique session_id number.  They all have limitations that UNIQUE_ID seems to have fixed.
I propose these modules be changed to use UNIQUE_ID.

I also propose that Apache module programming documentation be changed to recommend using UNIQUE_ID as well.

Having a standard will make things much easier for module programmers.

A function to "uu-decode" the string should also be incorporated so the modules can access the exact time of it.  (I have a non-system-independent version available).  Another alternative is to set an env variable to the time the unique id was made (UNIQ_START_TIME).

If everything will be using UNIQUE_ID, the variable should be calculated in the Apache core.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm marking this for future consideration, but I need to
point out a couple of things:

o mod_unique_id is an optional module, and may not always
  be available in the running server
o The UNIQUE_ID value is opaque -- meaning that it is not
  intended to be 'decodable'
o Inter-module callbacks are currently not supported for
  various good reasons

However, the idea is worthy of attention for a future
version.  Thanks for submitting it, and for using Apache.

 Another problem with this is that UNIQUE_ID is unique
 to the *request*, not to the 'session.'  If you have a page
 with several images on it, each will be fetched using a
 different request, and each such request will get a different
 UNIQUE_ID value.  You *are* proposing that UNIQUE_ID be used
 as a key to maintain state across several requests, right?
 Or have I misunderstood?
