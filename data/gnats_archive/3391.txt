>Description:
  The REMOTE_HOST variable passed to CGIs on NCSA used to have the remote host
of a connection, or, if no host was available, the IP address.

  Newer versions of Apache has changed that to: REMOTE_HOST exists only if the-
re *is* a host to be informed. However, there's still no note about that in the
compatibility notes.

  I may be showing myself selfish, but a lot of CGIs created for NCSA uses the
REMOTE_HOST variable and they fail when it's not set,  as describbed  in  pre-
vious bug report(s).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
  I'd like to suggest that the REMOTE_HOST would still acquire the IP  address
if there's no host name available, but the REMOTE_ADDR would still  exist.  It
would only be a matter of checking if REMOTE_HOST == REMOTE_ADDR  to  know  if
there *is* a host name or not... and Apache would retain a somewhat nice  com-
patibility with the old nice NCSA.
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Nov 12 09:52:17 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The CGI spec (essentially from NCSA) says that the
REMOTE_HOST variable should not be set unless there is a
reverse lookup.  This is described quite clearly in the
CHANGES file and in the upgrading_to_1.3 file.
