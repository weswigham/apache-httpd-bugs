>Description:
I have a global "HostnameLookups off" in my config file. We are running
a non-IP-based Apache 1.3b5 with about 20 virtual hosts. All requests
in the logfile (via CustomLog) are logged with the full hostname instead the 
IP address. 

Any idea why ?

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure you have it set in the right config file, and
not some other config file that isn't being used?

Does it happen if you don't use a CustomLog directive?

Are you sure there are no hostname based access restrictions
on what hostnames can access the server?  If so, Apache has
to do lookups.
