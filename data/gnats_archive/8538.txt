>Description:
If MultiViews is enabled, QUERY_STRING isn't passed to CGI script correctly:

e.g.
OK: /cgi-bin/prog.cgi?aaa => QUERY_SCRIPT="aaa"
NG: /cgi-bin/prog?aaa => QUERY_SCRIPT=""
>How-To-Repeat:
<Directory "/path/to/cgi-bin">
Options +MultiViews
</Directory>

and try GET /cgi-bin/prog.cgi?aaa and GET /cgi-bin/prog?aaa
>Fix:
changes about mod_negotiation.c 1.106->1.107 causes this problem.
I think that apache doesn't set r->args correctly, but I have no idea to fix this problem.
