>Description:
There seems to be a problem with the src/Helpers/TestCompile routine that
determines whether to use system or builtin Expat library.  This also
happens with 1.3.22.

When I run src/Configure (with no changes to src/Configuration), it defaults
to "using system Expat", then when I do a make, it blows off the first time
it tries to find libexpat.so.0 (because that file is not in /usr/lib).  The
TestCompile routine is possibly finding it in /usr/local/lib, but then the
real build does not find it there so it errors.  If I try to get around the
problem by adding /usr/local/lib to EXTRA_LIBS, the Configure script then
defaults to "using builtin Expat" and at the end displays this error:

======== Error Output for sanity check ========
cd ..; gcc  -DSOLARIS2=251 -DUSE_EXPAT -I./lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED      -o

 More info about this problem.  It seems that gcc does not return an error
 if a nonexistant library is included on the command line (e.g., -lexpat)
 unless something in the program actually needs that library.  So when
 Configure does this:
 
 	./helpers/TestCompile lib expat
 
 it doesn't get an error so it thinks expat is installed.
