>Environment:
Win NT 4.0 SP3
MSVC 5.0
>Description:
WriteFile(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), ...) fails in CGI-bin executables.
GetLastError() returns ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE.  Replacing the call to WriteFile()
with an equivalent fwrite() works.

My guess is that the dup() and dup2() functions used in spawn_child_err_core()
are not completely compatible with the Win32 SDK functions, though
Microsoft claims, "All run-time library routines included with [MSVC] are
compatible with the Win32 API."
>How-To-Repeat:
In a working C/C++ CGI-bin program, replace calls to fwrite(), fputs(), etc,
with calls to WriteFile().
>Fix:
I haven't tested this, but my guess is that using the Win32 APIs (CreatePipe(),
GetStdHandle(), SetStdHandle(), DuplicateHandle(), CloseHandle()) in
spawn_child_err_core() would fix the problem.  (See the MSDN article titled
"Creating a Child Process with Redirected Input and Output" for sample code.)
The obvious question is, would this enable WriteFile(), only to disable
fwrite()%3

State-Changed-Why:
Yeah, the MSVC POSIX layer is a joke.  Sigh.  We bit the 
bullet and implemented the CreateProcess interface for
the child spawning code for Win32.  This is in the current 
CVS tree and will be in the next 1.3 beta release; if you
want to compile the current CVS tree you can find it at
http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/.  It *might* fix your problem.

 This problem has not manifested since I installed 1.3b5 in March.  I
 also moved to a new machine about the same time, so it's possible that
 there was nothing wrong with 1.3b3 that a fresh install of NT couldn't
 fix.  In any case, I think you can close it.

oops, that was the wrong button... at any rate, submitter 
reports no more problems as of 1.3b5.
