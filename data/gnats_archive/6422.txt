>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
>Description:
I'm using the "proxy throughput round-robin"-solution as described
in the Apache 1.3 URL Rewriting Guide (www.apache.org/docs/misc/rewriteguide.html).
Under UNIX all works fine.

RewriteEngine   on
RewriteLog   	logs/rewrite.log
RewriteLogLevel	9
RewriteMap      lb      prg:path_to_my_load_balancing_program
RewriteRule     ^/(.+)$ ${lb:$1}        [P,L]

Under UNIX <my_load_balancing_program> will be started when I start Apache .

But unfortunately under Windows NT Apache does not start it.
Apache goes into an endless loop.
The rewrite log contains 
   map lookup OK: map=lb key=index.html -> val=
   rewrite /index.html ->
instead of an error.

Thanks a lot in advance for any hints.
