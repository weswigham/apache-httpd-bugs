Solaris 2.5.1 with GCC.
>Description:
During the initial setup of Apache, "configure" does not check to make sure
that it can find "make" on a system (Solaris puts it in a rather "weird" place
by default) before it tries to run and do "useful" things.  It should probably
complain if it simply is unable to find anything it needs to run successfully
(eg. make, ar, ranlib, etc).

-- begin
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/www
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.2
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Solaris 251 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
./Configure: make: not found
 + adding selected modules
./helpers/TestCompile: make: not found
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!

-- end
>How-To-Repeat:
Solaris 2.5.1, make sure /usr/ccs/bin is not in the path.  Try running configure.
>Fix:
The "configure" script should first check for anything it needs to run or which
it expects to use during the compilation or installation phase of getting the
server going.

 Technically this is no problem. It would be just a for-loop inside APACI's
 configure script iterating over src/helpers/PrintPath calls. But life is not
 such simple. For instance some Solaris people use _only_ GNU make as "gmake",
 so when we check for "make" we would give an error, although the user intended
 to use "gmake" later. Same for "ranlib": We cannot generally look for it
 inside APACI's configure script because it's determined a lot of time later
 whether it's actually needed (we don't need ranlib on all platforms).
 
 So, I think we just would mess up the situation even more when we check for
 some tools. OTOH, the user already gets an error.  It's not from our
 configuration scripts, ok. But it's a shell error which results in mainly the
 same effect: The user is notified that "make" is not found.
