>Description:
In the following config it is not possible to access the 'test.bla.com' site.
If the <virtualhost> statements were switched, it would use the 'ServerAlias *' as a catch. 

<virtualhost 1.1.1.1>
Servername www.bla.com
ServerAlias *.bla.com>
</virtualhost>
<virtualhost 1.1.1.1>
Servername test.bla.com
</virtualhost>
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think the most logical fix is to make 'ServerAlias *' act as a catch. IE, the order of ServerAlias statements shouldn't matter anymore. This is the behaviour of several other unix config files like the 'virtusertable' file.
