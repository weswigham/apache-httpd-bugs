>Environment:
mod_access lets you restrict access to certain subnets.  Unfortunately the
test it does allows only subnets deefined on octet boundaries.  Rutgers
is now using subnets with 64 hosts.  We would like to modify mod_access
to allow a syntax such as 128.6.26.128/255.255.255.128, or possibly
128.6.26.128/25 (meaning a 25-bit mask).  As a matter of policy we prefer
not relevant [the issue is documented behavior]

not to make modifications unless we've verified that the maintainer will
take them back.  Otherwise we create a problem for future releases.
Would you accept diffs implementing such a feature?

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, this is a good feature to add.  I like specifying
the length of the mask myself, but either way would be
fine.  See http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/patches/1.2/cidr.patch
for a contributed patch to do this.  Not sure if it patches
cleanly into 1.2 or not.  If someone gets around to looking
at it, something similar should endup in the source
at some point...

This feature has been committed to 1.3a2-dev as part of a
mod_access overhaul.
