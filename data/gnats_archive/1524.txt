SIGSEGV, but no core... and cores are enabled

We had to take the server down and put an old version back.  If you e-mail me, I can put it back up on other ports long enough for you to see the problem.

not at the moment...  Haven't been able to trace it with no core.

 I think you mean version 1.3b3 not 1.2b3, right?
 
 You won't get a coredump because of a security protection feature which
 prevents programs that ever ran as root from dumping core.  You can patch
 your kernel with
 <ftp://ftp.angmar.org/pub/patches/kernel/kernel-2.0.30-setuid_coredump.diff>
 (it probably patches against 2.0.32, I haven't tried yet).  Or you can try
 running it using
 <http://www.arctic.org/~dgaudet/patches/apache-1.3-listenwrap.patch>. 
 
 arctic is running 1.3b3 on a 2.0.32 system, but not with glibc like redhat
 5, and I'm not getting coredumps on /~login as you can see.  So if you can
 compile the server with -g, and run it on a different port as a non-root
 user and get a coredump... and get us a stack trace that would be
 excellent.

 yea.. sorry, must have mistyped the version...
 
 Ok, the system isn't mine, I was just porting apache_ssl and mod_auth_msql
 and adding a few other features for the admin of the server my vhost site
 runs on.  The speed boost between 1.2.4 and 1.3b3 is absolutely incredible..
 Thanks guys ;)  I'll see if I can trace it and maybe figure out where the
 problem is.  I'm not at all familiar with redhat 5, unfortunately.. I have
 always run slackware on my own servers.  Maybe I'll be able to get it up and
 running with redhat..

 now then.. this is odd.. running it as myself on 8080..
 
 I don't seem to be getting any logging of the sigsegv..  I'm getting logs..
 thats not a problem (all the conf and log dirs I'm running out of are owned
 by me as well)...
 
 but still.. I get an empty document for /~jclary/ and an unrecognized
 response for /~jclary  but /~jclary/index.html works...
 
 I'll leave it up and give you a chance to look.. its on
 http://www.linuxbox.com:8080/

 sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't...

 I can't really diagnose anything by visiting that url though... If you're
 familiar with gdb I think you're going to have to attach to it and walk
 through things in mod_userdir to find out what is up.
 
 My guess is that there is a problem with the getpwnam() call.  glibc
 changes the struct passwd used for that call so all old libc5 compiled
 code needs to be recompiled with glibc.  Is there a chance that you
 compiled with the wrong header?  Or that you've got a libc5 .o file lying
 around?
 
 Dean
