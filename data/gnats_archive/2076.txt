>Description:
mod_include does a hard_timeout(), and then proceeds to invoke other
modules via sub_req_lookup_{uri,file}, and actually invoke other
handlers via run_sub_request().  This is all somewhat bogus -- because
modules frequently can't prepare themselves for timeouts occuring at
arbitrary points in the code.  The timeouts should be disabled during
the nesting.

Ok that doesn't sound serious enough does it?  Well what if I mention
that because timeouts *DON'T NEST* the mod_include timeout disappears
after the first nested include of almost any other module... i.e. it
disappears when the first ap_kill_timeout() happens.  Just try it, 
nested include something small followed by a lot of crap and disconnect
the ethernet from the client while the crap is being transmitted.  There's
no outstanding timeout.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
yeah, disable timeouts before subrequests and re-enable them afterward
