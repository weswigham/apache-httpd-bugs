State-Changed-Why:

Two things to try:
1. Check the order that you are loading the modules into
the server.  You probably want the AddModule line
for mod_vhost_alias to be before the one for
mod_alias, but you might want to try it the other way
too, just to be sure.
2. There is no need to enclose the directives in a
<VirtualHost *> section, since you want to do
mass vhosting on all IP addresses.  Just put them
in the main server config context (outside any
sections).

Let us know how it goes.  If you are still having
problems, please be more specific about what "doesn't
work" means.  Does it have no effect at all, or
does it try to serve from the wrong location?
Thanks.

 I think you have got your LoadModule directives in the wrong order.
 Can you get me a copy of your httpd.conf and src/Configuration (or
 src/Configuration.apaci if you use configure rather than src/Configure).
 
 Tony.
