This problem has to do with the URL name mosaic.com. Our church here in Los 
Angeles is called Mosaic. We already are using the URL: mosaic.org. Of course, 
everyone trys mosaic.com first. But your using that as an entry link point to
your Web server, but not as your main URL. Could someone at your company contact 
me? We would be interested in using mosaic.com. I can be reached at the above 
email address or at 213-727-7900.
Thank you and God Bless You.

State-Changed-Why:
This form is for reporting bugs with the Apache server
software.  The site you are talking about is presumably
using Apache and has a link to our web page.  We have absolutely
nothing to do with them or the domain name mosaic.com.
