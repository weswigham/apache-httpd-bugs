SunOS dionysus 5.5.1 Generic_103640-21 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20
>Description:
When an Apache web server receives a POST where the EOL convention is simply "\n" (rather than "\r\n"), and the submitted POST data is text/plain, it assumes the POST data requires "\n" -> "\r\n" conversion and converts it, adding a "\r" before every "\n".  But it does not adjust the "Content-Length:" accordingly.  Therefore, the content is truncated by N bytes, where N is the number of "\r"s added to the POST data.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Install a simple "echo" CGI program that simply prints out its data.
2) POST to it with a header containing no "\r" characters.
>Fix:
Add one to the "Content-Length:" every time you add a "\r" to the POST data.  Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.

Comment-Added:

Err, if the headers submitted by a client are
not terminated with "/r/n" the client is broken.

 True enough, but it still tickles a bug in Apache.  Apache should either
 correctly convert \n -> \r\n, or not bother.  That it truncates the data
 is a bug--admittedly minor, and only for broken clients, but still a
 bug.

State-Changed-Why:

Apache does not do any EOL conversion in POST content.
Are you sure this isn't being caused by a proxy or
firewall in the middle, or perhaps a broken client?
