 I've tried to fix it by casting the -1 values to ap_wait_t for Apache 1.3.12.
 Thanks for your feedback.

 This is in the src/CHANGES file for apache 1.3.12:
 
   *) Cast integer ap_wait_t values in http_main.c to get rid of compile
      time errors on platforms where "ap_wait_t" is not defined as "int"
      (currently only the NEXT and UTS21 platforms).
      [Gary Bickford <garyb@fxt.com>, Ralf S. Engelschall] PR#5053
 
 I suspect I'm the only one still using UTS21, but this change broke there.
 The compiler complained about not being able to cast to a structure.
 It seems strange to cast an integer to a structure, but on the other hand
 it must be doing it implicitly without the cast (with a warning, not an
 error).  It is a union on UTS 2.1, but it is only an integer in size.  Is
 the fix working on NEXT, Gary?
 
 It looks to me like the status parameter isn't used by the "maintenance"
 function anway.  Should we just get rid of it?

 Sorry,
 I got caught up in a big project for a startup, haven't had time to sleep
 since December (I'm weeks behind schedule now...)  I don't know when I'll
 have time to look.  I appreciate your work on this, I'm sorry I couldn't hold
 up my end of the bargain.  I defer to your wisdom on what to do.
