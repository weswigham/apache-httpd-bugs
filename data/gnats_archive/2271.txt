FreeBSD-2.2.6-STABLE, gcc
>Description:
When using suexec on a Apache Server with FrontPage extentions and module installed, suexec will not allow the fpexe program to execute due to the permission on the file and directory /usr/local/frontpage/currentversion/apache-fp/_vti_bin.  The problem only occurs when trying to access user subwebs, or virtual webs on the server, there is no problem accessing the root web.

The attached patches corrects this problem.

Scot W. Hetzel
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile & install Apache 1.2.x with fp-patch-apache-1.2.5 and suexec.
Install the FrontPage Extentions on a user web & virtual web.
Start the server and try to access the user web from FrontPage 98.

The patch is, unfortunately, unreadable; newlines seem
to have gotten chomped with abandon.  Do you have a version
for 1.3.12 that you can send?
