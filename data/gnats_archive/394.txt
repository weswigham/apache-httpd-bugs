I'm not very familiar with this service (including it's response time).
Do I miss any relevant field ? Why don't I get any answer to this patch ?
I was unable to locate this request in your database.
Perhaps I have mail delivery problems.

I apologize if you have about 34189 copies of this request

Could you help me ?

My original request was: (Working since 1.2b7 it referes now to 1.2b8)

In order to keep compact (and easy to read) files comment could be held in
the configuration lines, as follows:

Port            80                          #; Must be root if < 1024
HostnameLookups On                          #; On/Off. Log names/IP addresses
User            nouser                      #; Name or Id
Group           nogroup                     #; Name or Id
#BrowserMatch   Mozilla/2 nokeepalive

By this way comment would be:

    Any line starting by # at column 1

    Any characters after the #; sequence

The double character allows both # and ; to be part of non-comment field
in any config line
