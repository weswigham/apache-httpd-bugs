Greetings,

I have a few simple small programs that can be used to have apache log to a PostgreSQL database.  The idea is very similar to the rotatelogs program that currently comes with apache.  If this might be useful, please let me know where to send the program files and docs.  It's not very big, a total of 50K maybe.

Thanks,
Matthew

State-Changed-Why:

This sounds useful.  Unfortunately, we really don't
have a system for hosting third party utilities at the
moment.  I sugest you put your files on a web page,
and then list them in the Apache module registry at
http://modules.apache.org/

Thanks for your contribution!
