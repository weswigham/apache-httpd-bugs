>Environment:
BSDI BSD/OS 4.3 x86
gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
>Description:
I was trying to run a CGI program with Apache 2.0.28 on BSDI BSD/OS 4.3,
and found that when read() on a nonblocking pipe returned -1, errno wasn't
setting set (to EAGAIN); it was 0.  So apache didn't do its timeout call
and the CGI request got a 500 Server Error (Premature end of script headers) after not reading anything from the CGI program many times in quick succession.
  
The problem turned out to be that when linking libapr.so, libtool was adding
-lc.  Then, when libapr.so was linked into httpd, -lc gets linked in again,
and there are now two copies of libc in apache's address space, each with its
own thread-safe copy of errno.

This problem also recently bit Steven Schultz <sms@to.gd-es.com> while
porting some video software from Linux to BSD/OS.

>How-To-Repeat:
Try to run a CGI program on BSD/OS (4.3, at least).
>Fix:
The libtool ltmain.sh that comes with apache 2.0.28 should be patched as follows.  libtool 1.4 as distributed with Mandrake Linux 8.1 has netbsd in the case statement, so clearly it should be added to apache's older copy as well.
