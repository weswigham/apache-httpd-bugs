Subject: user tracking module--on by default?

Most apache modules (status, anon_auth, cern_meta) don't automatically
activate when linked in.  The development version of mod_usertrack
does, though.  This is an undesirable behavior at our site, as well as
being inconsistent with other modules.  I've applied this patch locally:
