OS: Windows NT 4.0 , ServicePacke 5
Visual C++ 5.0
>Description:
With the new apache version 1.3.9 I have the effect that no output is
delivered from cgi-scripts if this output is produced from other child
programs (except batch scripts) inside the
script. The behavior is different if I start apache as a console
application. I this case new windows pop up, with the expected contents, but
not returned to the connected client.

======
@echo off
echo Content-type: text/html
echo.
echo on
echo "<html>"
echo "<pre>"
echo '-----------------'
C:\winnt\system32\cmd.EXE /A hugo
date
h:\l\CYGWIN~1\CYGWIN~1\H-I586~1\bin\sh.EXE -c date
h:\l\perl-active-517\bin\perl.EXE -V
echo '================='
set
echo "</pre>"
echo "</html>

>Fix:
One fix was given
  by Bill Stoddard <stoddard.nospam@raleigh.ibm.com>
  in comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
  which fixes this problem on my configuration.
