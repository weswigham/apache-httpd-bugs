Hi !

I was installing apache 1.3.6 and followed the INSTALL file which came with the dist.
But I guess you have missed a step. I add the text below here to make it easier to find:
gunzip apache_1.3.x.tar.gz
tar xvf apache_1.3.x.tar
gunzip php-3.0.x.tar.gz
tar xvf php-3.0.x.tar
cd apache_1.3.x
./configure --prefix=/www
cd ../php-3.0.x
./configure --with-mysql --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x --enable-track-vars
make
make install
cd ../apache_1.3.x
./configure --prefix=/www --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a
 (The above line is correct!  Yes, we know libphp3.a does not exist at this
  stage.  It isn't supposed to.  It will be created.)
make
 (you should now have an httpd binary which you can copy to your Apache bin dir)

make install # this make install was missing in your version.

cd ../php-3.0.x
cp php3.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php3.ini
You can edit /usr/local/lib/php3.ini file to set PHP options.
Edit your httpd.conf or srm.conf file and add:
  AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3

As you saw of my comment the make install on apache was missing.
Might be good to add it.. =)

Thanks for your great work.

Regards,
    Eric Persson

Hmmm... I'm not sure where this example comes from, 
but I don't think it is valid anymore.

Thanks for using Apache!
