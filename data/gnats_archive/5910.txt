>Description:
The logic for MODULE_MAGIC_AT_LEAST in ap_mmn.h is bogus. The greater-than
signs should be less-than. The macro should return a 1 if the version given
in the argument is lower than or equal to the current version being run. As
it is currently written, it does the opposite.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
[akalice:www] /_ diff ap_mmn.h.orig ap_mmn.h
