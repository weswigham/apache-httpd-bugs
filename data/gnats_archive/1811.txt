Hi!

  Having a virtual Server  "info.rexroth.de"
  Other virtual servers are two proxy-server and other info servers.
  Each server has it's own referer-log or set to /dev/null.

<VirtualHost info.rexroth.de>
  [...]
  RefererLog logs/referer.info_log
  RefererIgnore  info.rexroth.de
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost proxy.rexroth.de>
  [...]
  RefererLog            /dev/null
</VirtualHost>
                       
The referer log shows for "referer.info_log" entries like (e.g.):
 "http://mpoint.mannesmann.de/mm/welcome-bottom.html -> http://mpoint.mannesmann.de/mm/Images/dot.gif"

Any idea why? This entries should never apear in the log.
Could this be done by the proxy (instead of writing to /dev/null)?

Are info.rexroth.de and proxy.rexroth.de on different IP addresses?

 Yes:
   Different virtual ip addresses - but on the same machine.
   proxy2 = xx.xx.211.9
   proxy  =      .211.10
   info   =      .211.11
   etc.
 
   The virtual ip addresses are published via /etc/hosts, DNS and NIS.

State-Changed-Why:
Is it possible that those requests are coming in on 
info.rexroth.de's IP number?

I don't run an official proxy server for anyone on
www.apache.org, yet every day I see at least a half-dozen
requests for full URL's for pages nowhere *near* this
machine.  My gut tells me there's some buggy client 
software out there somewhere...

If you can verify that RefererLog /dev/null is 
definitely not working (e.g. it's still being 
sent to the RefererLog defined in info.rexroth.de)
let us know; if this is no longer a problem, also
let us know.  Thanks!
