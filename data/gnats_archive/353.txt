>Environment:
Apache-1.2b7, NCSA-httpd-1.5.1
SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.5.1, gcc-2.5.8
>Description:
Apache denies access to http://server/dir/link/, when
- link is a symbolic link to another directory, and
- this other directory contains an .htaccess file with an "Options" line NOT
  including a "FollowSymLinks" statement (even when "Indexes" is given), and
- In the global access.conf file, "Options FollowSymLinks" and "AllowOverride
  all" are set (in the relevant context).
NCSA-httpd does not.
In other words, Apache honours a non-given "FollowSymLinks" even after processing
the link; NCSA-httpd does not.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create the situation described above, and run Apache vs. NCSA-httpd over
the same webspace.

If my description is obfusicating, email me, and I send you full configuration files.
>Fix:
IMHO, this was a bug in NCSA-httpd, while Apache behaves correctly.
So, don't patch Apache, but put this problem to www.apache.org, section:
Known incompabilities to NCSA-httpd.%0

State-Changed-Why:
Actually I don't think Apache is correct in this case.  For example,
I did this:

cd htdocs/manual
echo Options -FollowSymLinks >.htaccess
cd ..
ln -s manual symlink

Then I accessed /symlink (or /symlink/) and got a 403, which is
the incompatibility that you're describing.  However if I access
/symlink/index.html it succeeds.  This is an inconsistency that
really shouldn't exist.  The symlink stuff is supposed to be tested
with the permissions of the parent directory.  I'm submitting a
patch for the rest of the group to consider.

Thanks for using Apache!
