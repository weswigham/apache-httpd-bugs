>Description:
When trying to get my pages for Apache 1.3.X to display under Apache 2.0.8
I found an inconsistency. Under Apache 1.3.X I have often commented out an html
line with the expression:

<!--#if expr="0!=0" -->

line to be commented out

<!--#endif -->

under Apache 2.0.28 this expression no longer works.  However

<!--#if expr="0 != 0" -->

does work.  I can live with this but think that this behavior should be
mentioned in the documentation.
