Win95
>Description:
I recently downloaded Apache 1.1.3 install pack (EXE) for win32 and
the servlet module JServ 1.0b1.

I installed Apache 'out of the box' on a Win95 system, letting it do
all the defaults.

I modified the 2 or 3 required fields in the 'httpd.conf' file and
fired it up. It worked (of course). Love it when a plan comes
together!

I shut Apache down and did the same for JServ.

I checked the 'httpd.conf' file and the modifications looked fine in
there. I checked the 'jserv.properties' file and everything looked
good in there too.

I fire up Apache now and it still 'works', but the JServ is not
working (completely anyway). If I do the test thing on
'localhost/jserv/' the 'servlet' works, but if I attempt to follow the
link on that page about 'ajpv11://localhost:8007', I get an 'Internal
Server Error' (generated from jserv).

Before I get into the technical stuff, there are no other modules
loaded (from the 'http.conf' file) other than JServ - that may come
into it later.

The log files are not 'at all' helpful.

Just starting up Apache with no hits yields:
'error.log' in Apache:

Despite the indication in the logs that JServ is not running, it is as
I can hit it at 'localhost/jserv/', but the rest of JServ is not
running.

A guess: What it looks like is JServ is somehow losing track of the
initial JVM it launches, which has successfully bound to port 8007.
All subsequent attempts to start <whatever> fail on the bind to that
port, hence the error log.

The question: Why is JServ losing track of the initial JVM it launches
(if it is...)? The Apache people obviously have it working or they
would not have released it, so what am I doing wrong? I have twiddled
very minorly with the .conf and .properties files, but I will own up
to a configuration error if it will solve this problem.

I have tried both JDK1.1.7B and JDK1.2. I am using JSDK2.0. Both JDK's
'work' as JServ 'runs' to display that page, but nothing else runs.

I have tried with all pathnames in forward and back slashes
"C:\Program Files\..." and "C:/Program Files/...", and in old DOS
format "C:\Progra~1\....".

Also have tried repositories being just directories and JAR files.

Also have tried putting the strings in quotes and not. i.e.
"C:\Program Files\..." vs. C:\Program Files\...

Several other people (4 as a matter of fact) have responded to my
posting in comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, saying that they
have the same problem. One fellow added that it was working on his NT
box, but not the Win95 box (presumably after identical
installations...). They emailed me direct, not repost.

HELP! Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
Mentioned above in full description.
>Fix:
None - except contact people that have it working on Win95, and obtain their
config files, compare them to mine to see if it is an error I (and others)
are making. If that does not pan out, discover what may be different about the 
config of my (and other) Win95 boxes than other that it works on... 
systedm dll's etc.

Comment-Added:

It seems that Windows/95, when using WinSock/2.0, is unable 
to initialize the WinSock layer, generating error #10106.
Here's the description (from WSAPI22.DOC):
(Thanks to Nick Brazziel <dbrazziel@snet.net>)

  WSAPROVIDERFAILEDINIT (OS dependent)
  Unable to initialize a service provider. Either a service
  provider's DLL could not be loaded (LoadLibrary() failed)
  or the provider's WSPStartup/NSPStartup function failed.

It could be a problem w/ environment settings within the
JVM process, when this is created by mod_jserv. (The path
not correctly set preventing WinSock to find -load- some
required dlls).
