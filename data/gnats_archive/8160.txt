>Organization:
>Environment:
RedHat 7.0, Apache 1.3.17, mod_ssl 2.8.0, OpenSSL 0.9.6, mod_jk
>Description:
On http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond it says that
Environment-Variables can be accessed with %{ENV:variable} (Special Note, 2.).

In PR#5147 (http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/5147) Ralf says that the
HTTPS-Variable can be accessed with %{ENV:HTTPS}, but this isn't working
(anymore). The HTTPS-Variable can only be accessed with %{HTTPS}

RewriteLog - using %{HTTPS}
(4) RewriteCond: input='off' pattern='=on' => not-matched

RewriteLog - using %{ENV:HTTPS}
(4) RewriteCond: input='' pattern='=on' => not-matched
>How-To-Repeat:
Works:
  # No SSL
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteLog /webapps/ca/logs/rewrite.log
  RewriteLogLevel 9
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} =on
  RewriteRule ^/(.*)  http://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R]

Doesn't work:
  # No SSL
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteLog /webapps/ca/logs/rewrite.log
  RewriteLogLevel 9
  RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPS} =on
  RewriteRule ^/(.*)  http://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R]
