microsoft visual c++ 5.0, nt 4.0 server patch level 3
>Description:
For some strange reason, netscape communicator 4.0[34] is not getting more
than 16k worth of stuff - both gif/jpg and html.  For example, manual/misc/FAQ.html
is cut off at answer 8.  Using netscape 3.01 and pointing it to the same server,
I get the full FAQ though.  Pointing the 4.0[34] at 1.24 running on linux, I get
the full faq.html too.  In short:

                   Communicator 4.03/win95   Navigator 3.01/NT

Apache 1.3b2/NT4   Cut off at around 16k     Full FAQ
Apache 1.24/linux  Full FAQ                  Full FAQ

Same problem with gif/jpgs - it loads about the first 16k too, and then stops.

 Hi,
 	I checked the bug database before reporting it - didn't see it, and
 I checked it again after receiving your mail - didn't see it too.  It looks
 like it can be a little difficult to search/read the database.  Is there an
 easier way to check and see if the bug I'm seeing has been reported?  We're
 planning on using apache on an NT machine running an application called
 FPWeb (java 1.0.2 based - sounds like great fun, no? :)) that'll be using
 ODBC calls (at least I think so - it may be calling it's own app) to hook
 to a MS Sequel db to pull images.
 	At least I hope we can use apache - I'm not sure how much of a
 fight it's going to be, seeing that it was designed for IIS/fasttrack.
 Anyway, if all goes well, this server will be mightyly stressed and I would
 like to be able to find out if (if any) the errors/bugs that I see has been
 reported already.
 	I think that's my point... :)  If you guys already have something
 in mind, and just need grunt work, you know, just someone to type/retype
 things in and such, I can help out a few hours/week.
 
 -Tai

 There are no significant bugs in MS products that customers want fixed.

Comment-Added:
If you enter "16k" in the "text to search for" field, and
click either the "Report Text" or "Header Fields" buttons,
you should find several reports.  Did you forget
to change the state selection to "any" from the default of
"open", maybe?
