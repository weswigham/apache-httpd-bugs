AddDefaultCharset On
in httpd.conf
>Description:
It seems that AddDefaultCharset adds charset not only to text/plain and text/html types, but for every type comes from CGI script too.. :-(

NN and IE don't understand generated
"Content-Type: image/gif; charset=iso-8859-1"
header at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use followng CGI script for testing:

#!/bin/sh
echo "Content-type: image/gif"
echo
cat some.gif

>Fix:
Better checking of Content-Type.
