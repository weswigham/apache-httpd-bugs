 I also ran into this problem. The fix turned out to be related to a patch by Manoj on March 30 (rev.
 1.337). If you want to
 stick with the code youy've got, look at that patch and hand apply it (remove 'using_shlib=0' from
 '*-ibm-aix4.3' entry of src/Configure).
 
 A better solution would probably be to get the latest copy of code from 1.3.7-dev, which has this
 fix (and others).
 
 Good luck.
