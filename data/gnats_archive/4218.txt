>Description:
I'm trying to build jserv with an existing apache rpm installed.

Your INSTALL file says:
For DSO use:

       --with-apache-install=/path/to/apache/installation

     NOTE: The configure script will check the default installation dir
     so if you have it there you may leave this argument out.   

So I don't give --with-apache-install because I am hoping that configure
will find my redhat installation of apache.  (I don't want to download
and build Apache just to use jserv, right --- what are modules for?)

This is the relevant output of configure:

checking for Apache directory... checking for Java Servlet classes... /x/gback/classes/jsdk.jar

This is inconclusive.
As a matter of fact, when I type "make",
nothing gets built.  No mod_jserv.o, nothing.
So... what do I do?  I don't even know what the /path/to/apache/installation is.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply configure and make, like so
./configure --with-jsdk=...
make
>Fix:
First, make configure more verbose so I know what's going on.
Secondly, refer to preinstalled rpms/debs in your INSTALL file documentation.
When I type rpm -q -l apache, it lists a variety of files scattered
all over the place, but I have no clue what the
/path/to/apache/installation would be in this case.

[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
