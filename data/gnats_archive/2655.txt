uname -a: Linux linux.whiteduck.com.br 2.0.34 #2 Tue Jul 14 14:13:28 EST 1998 i586 unknown
Apache 1.3.0 pre-compiled RPM downloaded from sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/redhat/contrib/hurricane/i386
Official Red Hat 5.1
>Description:
I have a Linux machine running Apache 1.3.0, RPM upgraded from 1.2.6. I've mirrored TUCOWS in this machine, and I configured it this way:
named -> tucows.whiteduck.com.br is a CNAME to linux.whiteduck.com.br
In Apache 1.2.6, it was configured with VirtualHost, working perfectly. I could use www2 (another CNAME to linux) and tucows separatedly, no problems with that.
After I upgraded Apache to 1.3.0, www2 is conflicting with tucows. After I saw this problem, I looked in Apache's manual. Reading it, I discovered that I need to add a new line, NameVirtualHost. Adding it or not, I can access www2, linux and tucows.whiteduck.com.br, and Apache will show only the TUCOWS mirror, logging everything in tucows_access_log and tucows_error_log.
I've tried everything I could think, but I still couldn't make it work 100%.
>How-To-Repeat:
tucows.whiteduck.com.br, linux.whiteduck.com.br, www2.whiteduck.com.br all lead to what should appear only in tucows.whiteduck.com.br
>Fix:
VirtualHost should work exactly as before, in Apache 1.2.6

State-Changed-When: Tue Jul 21 13:05:51 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
As described in the vhost docs, if you declare something as
a name based vhost then requests that don't match will _not_
fall through as if they were not sent to a virtualhost, but
will be served by one of the vhosts.

This means that you have to configure another vhost if
you want other requests on that IP address to be served
by it.  ie. make a vhost for your "main" server.
