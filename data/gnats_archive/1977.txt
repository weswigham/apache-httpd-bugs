>Description:
Dear Apache,

     I am running Solaris-2.6 with recommended patches on a Sun
Ultra 1 with 128Mb physical memory.  Built Apache-1.3b5 cleanly with
SunPro C compiler and mod_rewrite.  It hangs intermittantly.

When hung apache will not serve anything.  The parent is trying to
kill and wait for a hung child which will not die.

Kill -9 fails to kill this child. 
Kill -9 on the parent leaves orphaned children.
Reboot is the only cure I have found.

 Yes.
 >If so, is your ServerRoot on a NFS partition?  
 No.  But the document root was local (/export/www) but accessed
 through the automounter as /share/www.  I have changed this so the
 server accesses directly through /export/www and will monitor.
 
 >If so, add a LockFile directive to move it to a local disk.
 
 Not done this.
 
 Thanks for your help.

 I tried that and it hung after ~5 minutes...

 I have been testing on our departmental webserver so I am loathe to
 disrupt it further, so I am reverting to 1.2.5...
