>Description:
An old version of apache (1.2.5) used to put hostnames, rather than dotted-quad
addresses only, into the error_log file, according to the setting of the
HostnameLookups directive. By 1.3.20 this has changed to dotted-quads only, and
the source (line 398 of src/main/http_log.c) makes the comment "TODO: add a
method of selecting whether logged client addresses are in dotted quad or
resolved form". 

There's a one-line fix to get this functionality: change the
last arg in the call to ap_sprintf from r->connection->remote_ip to
  ap_get_remote_host(r->connection, r->per_dir_config, REMOTE_NAME)
This already-written routine already does the checks for HostnameLookups, doing
a once-only optimisation (admittedly only per connection, not per-IP-addr as 
the external post-processing tool "logresolve" does).

In these times of the CodeRed worm flap, I find it useful on lower-volume
webservers to have the client name directly in the logfile, rather than needing
to do post-processing to map IP addrs to hostnames.
>How-To-Repeat:
Design decision present in 1.3.20 (and probably earlier versions).
>Fix:
See above: one-line patch to call existing routine. Warning - I'm no apache
hacker, I've just coded this by symmetry with other calls to get_remote_host;
but it Works Fine For Me :-)

 Um, HostNameLookups affects printing of IP-dotted-quad vs hostname in
 *access* logfiles; my enhancement-request and bugfix concern the *error*
 file. (Sorry if the synopsis was misleading; the main text talks more
 clearly about it being the error file).
 
 So to give a clearer synopsis: the enhancement request and suggested
 implementation is to fix the *error* file so that hostnames rather than IP
 addresses are printed, under the control of HostNameLookups. A purist might
 prefer to have separate control over IP->hostname mapping for the access
 logfiles versus the error log, but that would need more coding than the
 one-liner I've tested and submitted.
 
 Cheers, Stefek

Sorry, I read too quickly.  I'll reopen this report
to see if anyone thinks this is a good idea.
I'm neutral on the topic.
