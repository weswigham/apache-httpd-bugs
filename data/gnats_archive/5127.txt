State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Mon Oct 11 13:04:42 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
We have absolutely nothing to do with the FrontPage server
extensions and have no control over them.  You need to talk
to MicroSoft.

As far as I know, they have not decided to support Apache
running on NT.  That is their decision, we can't change that.
