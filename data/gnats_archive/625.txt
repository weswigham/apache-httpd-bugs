 (hope this goes to the right list.  this is regarding PR#454 which i
 filed a few months ago.)
 
 i upgraded to Apache 1.2b10 and removed one of the two processors on
 the machine.  it crashed within 24 hours.
 
 if there is anything i can do to help debug the situation, please let
 me know.  this problem has been consistent since 1.2b8 -- 1.2b7 seemed
 somewhat more stable but still had the problem.

Comment-Added:
(Interesting, this pr is closed but the audit trail doesn't show
why.)

SunOS4 has a kernel bug in the allocation of memory for the mbuf table.
When it fills up, the result is a Panic the next time any routine tries
to set something in an imaginary mbuf beyond the range of the table.
Due to buggy browser behavior and the lack of a FIN_WAIT_2 timeout
on SunOS4, "KeepAlive Off" is necessary to avoid filling up the mbuf
table on busy sites.
