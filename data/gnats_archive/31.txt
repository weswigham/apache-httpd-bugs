>Description:
When trying to configure the "Group" directive to "nogroup", httpd exits with
error message "httpd: bad group name nobody".

I beleive that the default "DEFAULT_GROUP" value is always being used,
because I do have "nogroup" in the "/etc/group" file.

Quick fix is to add to group file group name "nobody".

>How-To-Repeat:
Do a basic configuration file and change the group to something other than
"nobody"

This has been fixed for the next release.  The correct fix
is indeed to change "nobody" to "nogroup".
