>Description:
When I want to make the "htpasswd", I found that "char crypt"
is not defined.  
Is there any support code from apache?  Or the code should be
defined in unistd.h?

Thanks.  =>

Not appropriate.

Write the procedure "char crypt (const char, const char)"

State-Changed-Why:
This is something your OS needs to supply.  Under FreeBSD,
adding a -lcrypt to the command line that compiles it
should work.
