>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
NT4.0, sp4, jdk1.2.2, jsdk2.1, Jserv1.1b3
>Description:
I installed both Apache and JServ, then verified using the servlet IsItWorking in the servlet directory without any problems.  But, when I tried to add new zones, it keeps complaining, saying something like servlet zone "myzone" not found in the mod_jserv.log.  No zone was working for me except for the zone "root".

Here are the only changes I made to the config/property files, following all directions in the doc:

1. in jerv.conf, added "ApJServMount /myservlets  /root1"
2. in jserv.properties, changed "zones=root" to "zones=root,root1"
3. in jserv.properties, added line
	"root1.properties=C:\Program Files\Apache JServ
1.1b3\servlets\zone.properties"
	which is pointing to the same place where root.properties is.

Entering http://127.0.0.1/servlets/IsItWorking is ok.  But, entering
http://127.0.0.1/myservlets/IsItWorking returns me an error of servlet zone
"root1" not found in mod_jserv.log.

Any info in greatly appreciated. If you don't mind sending me your jerv conf
and property file with zones that are working.



>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Send me config/properties files with zones working.
