>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.2.6-RELEASE, gcc 2.7.2

When several 'Listen port' directives are present in config file
and request to /somedir (without trailing slash) comes to non-default
port, mod_dir issues a redirect to http://server:default_port/somedir/

>How-To-Repeat:
Just add
Listen 80
Listen 81
into httpd.conf and try to access http://yourserver:81/somedir
You'll redirected to http://yourserver:80/somedir/

State-Changed-Why:
That is how things are supposed to work.  As the docs say,
if you want to listen on multiple ports you have to have
the appropriate virtualhost settings with the "port"
directive set for each.

As an alternative, setting "UseCanonicalName off" may
work around it.
