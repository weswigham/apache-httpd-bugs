File access.conf

Setup apache-ssl on debian, and try to access server-status.

No.  Would probably be something in the mod_status.o, that is what is called.

State-Changed-Why:
This report has nothing to do with the Apache distribution,
but relates to the specific modules you have built in.
Contact the 3rd party authors of ApacheSSL if you have 
ongoing issues.

 Same for server-status
 http://localhost/server-info works fine.
 http://localhost/server-status Lynx states, "Unexpected network error. connection aborted" and quits to the command line with lynx : Cant access start file.
 In the /var/log/apache-ssl/error.log I get a [notice] httpd: child pid 15297 exit signal Segmentation fault (11).
 There is no other signs that any thing went wrong.
