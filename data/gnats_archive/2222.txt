>Description:
Invalid requests for a SSI enabled document are succeeding.

e.g.  requests for the document "http://your.domain.com/test.shtml" are 
successful, but requests for http://your.domain.com/test.shtml/test.shtml  
will also succeed (the server returns the document, but relative links to 
graphics are broken).  Since the file /test.shtml/test.shtml does not 
exist the server should return a 404 error.  I have also tried to request
/test.shtml/another_file.html and the server returns the same results as 
/test.shtml/test.shtml.

I have seen this problem with both the .shtml handler and the XBitHack 
method of enabling SSIs.

State-Changed-When: Tue May 12 16:04:34 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is a feature, not a bug.  You can use PATH_INFO
in SSI parsed documents just like you can in CGIs,
where the same thing works.
