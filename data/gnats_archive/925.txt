>Environment:
Linux 2.0.30 gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Trying to redirect from /home/httpd/htdocs/secure to https://ssl.txcyber.com, ie:
"Redirect permanent /home/httpd/htdocs/secure(w/ or w/out trailing '/') https://ssl.txcyber.com"
accessing http://ssl.txcyber.com/secure(/) simply return (via http) /home/httpd../secure/index.html
but should return a redirect to https://ssl.txcyber.com. Printf statements in 
mod_alias.c show that the directive "Redirect" is being recognized and configured,
but it doesn't work no matter what I try-- in fact, no redirects work, https or not.
>How-To-Repeat:
go to http://ssl.txcyber.com/secure-- should redirect you to https://ssl.txcyber.com
I'll send config files, etc upon request.

 Try "Redirect permanent /secure /" or something like that.  You're
 specifying a path name where it's supposed to be a URL.

State-Changed-Why:
Assuming suggestion to specify a uri rather than a pathname
works. i.e.

Redirect /secure https://ssl.txcyber.com

 Interesting... it works w/ the trailing slash but not w/out...

 	You got it, but foolish is definitely relative ;)
