gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
This probably shouldn't be fixed, given the OS and the low importance.
Configure generates errors running buildinfo.sh, when date is called.  The resulting time variables are incorrectly set.

This problem occurs prior to OS-specific setup in the configuration process
>How-To-Repeat:
configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
>Fix:
change lines 112-116:time_day=3D"`date | awk '{ printf("%s", $1); }'`"
time_month=3D"`date | awk '{ printf("%s", $2); }'`"
time_year=3D"`date | awk '{ printf("%s", $6); }'`"
