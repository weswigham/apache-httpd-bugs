>Environment:
RedHat Linux 4.1 for Alpha:

uname -a output:
Linux gromit.webconn.com 2.0.27 #1 Sun Dec 22 01:14:45 EST 1996 alpha

gcc -v output:
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
I run ./Configure to create a Makefile and run "make".  All compiles fine (with
the exception of a few minor "incompatible pointer to integer" warnings), but
the final linking with the authorization modules complains of no definition
for crypt().

By adding the -lcrypt parameter to the link line, Apache finishes the compile.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache on an Alpha Linux machine.
>Fix:
Add "-lcrypt" to the EXTRA_LIBS parameter in "Configuration" before running
./Configure

 I don't have a libcrypt on my redhat 4.1 i386 system.  Is this only a
 requirement on alpha?  Have you by chance installed your own libc? 
 
 Is there an "international" vs. "us-only" version of redhat?  I haven't
 noticed one before...

 The patch below should do the job.  Given that redhat generally just
 repackages the standard libc, I'm guessing this is a problem on all
 linux alphas.
