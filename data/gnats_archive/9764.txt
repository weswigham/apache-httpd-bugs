WINNT LIQINGYIN 5.0 2195 xx I386 (win2000)
>Description:
I set a chinese directory to the directive ServerRoot in the apache version 2.0.28, then the function utf8_to_unicode_path return failed status.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Apache regardes the all characters as utf-8 encoding. Apache should distinguish chinese character. For example:

while (...) {

    /* ascii */
    if (!(*ptr & 0x80)) {
    /* convert gb2312/gbk or Japanese to ucs2 */
    c = conv_gbk_to_ucs2(p, &w, wptr, &wl);
    ...
    }
    else {
        /* convert ascii to ucs2 */
        rc = conv_utf8_to_ucs2(p, &a, wptr, &wl);
        ...
    }
}

State-Changed-Why:

Apache on WinNT uses the UTF-8 encoding throughout the 
internals to provide i18n accessability to the files
stored in Unicode on FAT32 and NTFS volumes.

This is for two reasons; one is speed.  The physical
storage is in Unicode, therefore the straight conversion
between utf-8 and unicode is considerabily faster than
any other translation scheme.

The second is security, since the character encoding has 
implications for capturing invalid characters.

The remaining bug will be fixed in .34 - we will strip off
the MS-ish prefix from the utf-8 .conf/.htaccess files so 
that Apache wouln't fail to load the configuration saved
from 'nonstandard' editors [e.g. Notepad.]

If you care to open a request for a module that might decode
URLs given in other character encodings; or might process
config files from other codepages, please file a very 
specific feature request (with patch, if you like) to the
new bugzilla tracking system at 

  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/

Thanks for your report; I'm sorry your patch is too specific
for consideration - utf-8 really provides the only open
encoding standard that could satisfy the entire Apache 
community.
