Win95 in Japanese
>Description:
Have upgraded Win95 using Winsock2, installed Apache/1.3.9(Win32) by apache_1_3_9_win32.exe.

Running from the Start menu.
Display follows in a opened console window.

Must be installed in Japanese mode.
Cannot install device driver
Apache/1.3.9 (Win32) running...

When I run "http://localhost/cgi-bin/test1.cgi", "Download file 
message box" was out.
When I entered http://localhost/, it displays "It Worked! The Apache Web Server is Installed on this Web Site! ".
When I entered http://localhost/cgi-bin/, it displays "Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/ on this server.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Apache/1.3.9 Server at jyo@bell-net.co.jp Port 80".

The Error Log Messages is:
"[Wed Apr 19 12:37:02 2000] [error] [client 172.16.0.25] attempt to invoke directory as script: c:/apache/cgi-bin".

My question is how to install Apache/1.3.9 (Win32) in Japanese mode in Win95?
I use Win95 in Japanese, why I don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/, after set "ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:/Apache/cgi-bin/" in httpd.conf?
What should I do?

State-Changed-Why:
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Apache here.  You aren't supposed
to be able to access the directory itself.  Apache seems to be
installed just fine on your system, your CGI is probably doing something
wrong or you have probably misconfigured it.  Please bring this up in an appropriate support forum, such as usenet.
