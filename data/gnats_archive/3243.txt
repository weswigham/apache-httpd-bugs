[Mon Oct 19 11:59:19 1998] [crit] (125)Address already in use: make_sock: could
not bind to port 80

There are several descriptions of this problem in the problem database but
no solutions that I can find.  If I shut down a server and try to add a software
virtual host to its configuration, I can not restart with virtual hosting
enabled.  If I use the non-virtual hosting configuration the server starts up
fine.

I can get virtual hosting to work if I restart the machine, but this is a bad
solution to a problem that can probably be worked around in Apache.

I have read the information concerning the "WORKAROUND_SOLARIS_BUG" directive
in http_main.c but even with 2.6 it doesn't solve the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Shut down a non-virtual hosted server (or a virtual hosted Apache server
   that started when the machine started up)
2) Try to restart the Apache server with virtual hosting

Can you either ignore or terminally kill any listeners?

Erm... how are you shutting Apache down?

Are there any httpd processes still running after you
shut it down?

What does netstat -na show for sockets on port 80?

 I shut Apache down with a kill -TERM so I can reload the configuration
 files with a command line restart.
 
 Other Apache servers (non virtual) are still running on port 80 from
 their own configuration files, root directories and with different IP
 addresses.  There are no processes running or sockets open for the
 Apache server/IP address in question.

 On the parent or the child?

 Please show the netstat output of all the servers that are listening on
 the port.  ie. "netstat -na | grep LISTEN | grep \\.80
 
 What is the BindAddress or Listen directive set to in the other servers,
 and what is it set to in this one?
 
 It appears like you are trying to bind to the wildcard address, ie. *:80.

 Indeed, there was a general *:80 binding on the server.  Killing all of
 my various Apache servers did not make the binding go away so I assume
 it is from different server software we are running for HTTPS.
 
 Adding a "Listen" directive to the main Apache configuration area solved
 the problem:
 
 Port 80
 ServerName www.xyz.org
 NameVirtualHost 111.222.333.30
 Listen 111.222.333.30:80
 
 <VirtualHost 111.222.333.30>
 ServerName www.xyz.org
 ...
 </VirtualHost>
 
 <VirtualHost 111.222.333.30>
 ServerName www.abc.org
 ...
 </VirtualHost>
