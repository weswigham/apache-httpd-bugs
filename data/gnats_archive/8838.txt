>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 2000 SP2
>Description:
Apache Monitor app, when in the systray.  Click the app.  Correct light status is shown.  Roll over the daemons.  Wrong status is shown. (Lights are green instead of red, vice versa.)

This was done with 1.3.12 and 2.0.26-dev on one win2k system.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install more than one apache instance. Have one running and one stopped. Run Apache Monitor.  Click once to show a list of the Apaches.  Light status will be correct.  Now mouseover one or the other.  The lights will now show reverse or wrong status.
>Fix:
Examine code which chooses which light (green/red) to display when mouseing over the icon.
