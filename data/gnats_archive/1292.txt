Im having a similar problem...
when i run cgi scripts via apache 1.2.4
theyre crashing my navigator 3.02 browser...
but it isnt consistent..sometimes the scripts run fine..
other times they crash the browser...
someone suggested that it may be because the scripts are
returning http 1.1 headers to the browser..
and the browser is only compatible with http 1.0 headers??
any thoughts???

Note: netscape gold..and internet explorer dont crash..
they run the scripts fine...all the time

State-Changed-Why:
This is probably the same problem as that described in
PR#1142 <http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1142>.  I have
tracked that problem to a bug in Navigator when it deals
with keep-alive connections.  I have been unable to produce
a simple test example, or to narrow down which versions cause
it.  It also appears that there is no workaround other than
to disable all keep-alive, something which is not a workaround
at all in my books.  So I've given up researching this
problem for now.

 thanks for the response - 
 
 I tried turning keepalive off, however the 
 problem persisted, we saw it on Netscape
 3.03 Unix, 3.01 NT, and 3.0 95, and 
 communicator professional. I didn't 
 test IE. I found no randomness, it always
 occured, however the data did sometimes get 
 through from the post when the browser was 
 reloaded.
 
 I'm sorry to hear you will not be continuing with
 this, I have had to revert to 1.2.0 (where the problem
 doesn't exist), and loose the benefits I found in 1.2.4,
 namely the fewest server errors we have ever had
 
 If you want us to liase on a tcp test, or whatever
 I will talk to our Unix adminstrators about setting 
 something up
 
 thanks again for the prompt response

 If you can supply us with a full packet tcpdump of the entire session
 between the client and server then we can study it and decide if it's a
 browser bug, and if so figure out if we can work around it.  If turning
 off keepalive didn't help you then this is likely a different bug. 
 (Although it gets tiring working around client bugs ...)
 
 Do this: 
 
     tcpdump -s 1514 -w dumpfile tcp port 80 and host client.ip.addr
 
 on the webserver as root, and then launch navigator on the client, and
 cause the bug to occur.  Then quit navigator on the client.  Then hit ^C
 on the tcpdump session. 
 
 gzip the dumpfile and if it's small (<100k) then mail it to us.  If it's
 large then put it somewhere and send us the URL. 
 
 Note that passwords and such sent from the client will be captured in
 this, so use non-sensitive data.
