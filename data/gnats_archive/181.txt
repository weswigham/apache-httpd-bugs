AIX 4.1.4, C for AIX
>Description:
The AddHandler directive (and presumably the other related directives) doesn't
properly match the given extension.  It will declare a match if the extension
string appears anywhere in the filename, not just at the end.  For example,
given the directive "AddHandler imap-file map", the filename "main.map" will
match, but so will "campus.map.html".  This can severely limit the available
namespace for files to be served.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://fire.weeg.uiowa.edu/test/bob-map.html works as expected.
http://fire.weeg.uiowa.edu/test/bob.map.html is processed as an image map
file (the srm.conf file contains the "AddHandler imap-file map" directive).

State-Changed-Why:
This is the correct behavior. Multiple file extensionscan be used to give various types of meta information, such as handler, language, mime type and encoding. It will always honorall extensions. As a workaround, if you want to hide an extension, youcould use an extension which has no meaning - which willmake all extensions to the _left_ of this one ignored.E.g. file.map.xxx.html - the 'map' extension will beignored, provided 'xxx' is not defined as a mime type,languague, handler or encoding.
