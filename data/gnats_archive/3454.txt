>Description:
In access.conf, if I wrap the following in <Directory "/home/project/web-docs/">, .htaccess Limit is enforced. If the following is wrapped in <Directory ~ "/home/.*/web-docs/">, .htaccess Limit is not enforced:

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit

The access.conf's <Directory /> sets a more restrictive ``AllowOverride None''.

This looks like an incomplete implimentation of the new regexp matching code for <Directory> and <Location> directives.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to use a regexp <Directory ~> directive to AllowOverride so that .htaccess <Limit>s are enforced in homedirs.
>Fix:
This may be a symptom of the same problem causing the likes of PR1829. I suspect it may also be the cause of the problem reported in PR3019.

State-Changed-Why:
This is actually how things are documented -- .htaccess occurs
while the non-regex directory sections are parsed.

Try using <Directory /home/*/web-docs>
