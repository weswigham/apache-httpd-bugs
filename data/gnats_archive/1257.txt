>Description:
When I open url to my cgi program, and pass it an argument like this:

http://nasser.machine.com/cgi-bin/my_program?argument

Apaches encounters an access violation: Unhandled execption in Apache.exe
(APACHECORE.DLL).

without an argument to the cgi program, it work, adding a "?argument" crashes
apaches.  I tested my cgi program on another server with argument and
it works ok, only on Apache 1.3b2 it crahses the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
simply write the most simple cgi program, put it in cgi-bin/ directory,
and issue the URL for it but add a 

?anything_here

after the name of the cgi program.
>Fix:
No, I tried to build apaches 1.3b2 in debug , but your Makefile.nt is broke,
I can not build the tartget _apached , to build it in debug. I was trying
to debug this myself to help
