RedHat 5.2 Linux, JDK1.1.7
Intel platform, scsi-based
JServ is compiled in to the Apache source
>Description:
I've just installed and tested the Apache Jserv and it's working great. But when
I set logging in jserv.properties to true the JVM will not start. The log on the
other hand works and tells me JVM died too many times.

If I set log to false everything works again. When I do ps ax after I started
the server a pidnr says (java <zombie>) for a couple of secs and then go away.

I've not had this problem with previous versions of Apache JServ.

 the problem is that the JVM does not have write perms to the file so it is
 dying. of course this should be handled more gracefully, but it isn't
 rightnow. ;-(
