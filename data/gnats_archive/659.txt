>Description:
Using mod_proxy to ProxyPass to a remote server.  Also using mod_log_config to log these hits.  I'm capturing %{Content-Type}o, which should be the 
value of the "Content-Type" header in the response.  It appears as though
instead, it's using the content-type from some sort of internal mapping - for
example, 

  http://hyperreal.com:8001/organic/index.html

is text/html, however "text/x-server-parsed-html" is logged.  Where the content-type is ambiguous, i.e.

  http://hyperreal.com:8001/organic/index

a "-" is logged.  Shouldn't it be "text/html" in both cases?

State-Changed-Why:
Do you have SSI enabled on that server/location?  If so,
that probably accounts for the odd content-type.  Not why
it's record in the log, though.  Try accessing a location
for which SSI *isn't* enabled and see what gets recorded.

 I have SSI enabled on both the remote server and the proxy, but the remote
 server is correctly producing text/html as the content-type, so that's what the
 proxy should be getting (and is), yet the proxy reports in the log that it's
 text/x-server-parsed-html.
