Howdy Apache folks,

I just submitted a bug report which needs clarification:

After further poking, it appears that the server is denying access to userdirs
with the exception of those explicity overriding the server directive in a
.htaccess file. Using the same config reported earlier plus:

Module Name: http_core.c 
access.conf 
       <Directory /> 
         AllowOverride None
       </Directory> 

I am able to override <Limit> access with a .htaccess in the user dir like so:

<Limit GET>
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Limit>

Cheers - Gregg
