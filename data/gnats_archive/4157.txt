I just installed the 1.3.6 on NT Workstation 4.0 SP4.

I thought I was suffering from what you described, but then I found the
InstallShield hidden behind all other windows.

I do not know how long it had been there (maybe all along?) but it
proceeded just fine after I clicked on it and ran with it.

Hope this helps.
