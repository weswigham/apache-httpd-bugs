Jun 27 01:43:56 6A:gps unix: Process has been killed to prevent infinite loop
Jun 27 01:44:41 1A:gps unix: |$(0x6dd)ALERT: Process [httpd] 150548 generated trap, but has signal 11 held or ignored

- when once running make there are lots of warnings on the screen
- gcc 2.95.2 with gmake 3.79.1 don't make things better
- older Apache versions seems to have the same problem on Irix
