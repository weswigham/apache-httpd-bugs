>Description:
There are two indications of the problem:

The first: after running for a while the master daemon looses all its children,
strace shows that it just wait4()'s in an endless loop. Sending it a HUP signal
corrects the problem. I made a workaround, check for the number of running 
apache processes from cron and if it is 1, then send it a HUP, but this is 
not a solution.

The second: I compiled php3 support into apache. From a php3 script I call an
external program, then I check the return value. When I start apache it works
0fine, but after a while the return value is always -1. I have a strace log to 
show this problem:

pipe([5, 6])                            = 0
fork()                                  = 9904
close(6)                                = 0
fstat(5, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...})   = 0
mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x401a4000
read(5, "", 4096)                       = 0
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
close(5)                                = 0
wait4(9904, 0xbfffd440, 0, NULL)        = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)

actually these are all handled with the popen() and pclose() libc functions, 
called from the php module. php has nothing setup to handle SIGCHLD's, and as 
I see, apache doesn't either. I cannot quite understand what could cause this
a child exits and then wait4() reports there are no children. It looks as 
somehow SIGCHLD gets managed by SIG_IGN or something... afaik the child should 
be in <zombie> state until wait4()-ed, unless the SIGCHLD is handled by SIG_IGN

 Can you reproduce it with libc 5.x?  I don't trust glibc 2.0.x, and I've
 never had this problem on a libc 5.c system.

 This sounds like a broken libc.  Either that or they're interpreting the
 sigchld semantics using some variant of POSIX or Single Unix which I'm not
 understanding.  That trace looks completely bogus.  You're right, there is
 no SIGCHLD handler, so the wait4() is in error. 
 
 I'm still not in any position to change any of my machines to glibc 2.0.x,
 so I'll have a hard time debugging this.
 
 Any chance you could try to reproduce it with a small test program?  Then
 we can track down just who is at fault.

 I'll report this to the glibc people too then...

 I don't think so :( It needs to run several hours to reach this state :(

Comment-Added:
How many log files does your server have?  I've got a similar report
from another glibc user and I'm trying to narrow the differences.
See http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1893 for details on the other
user's system.  If you could tell me about any similarities you
see with your system that'd be great.

Thanks
Dean

 The kernel is stock 2.0.33, libc is now 2.0.7pre1-1 (from the debian
 package) but it happened with 2.0.5c and 2.0.6 too.
 
 Btw it really seems to be a SIGCHLD handling problem. In my bugreport I
 mentioned a problem with PHP too. It is gone now, since I've added a 
 signal(SIGCHLD,SIG_DFL); to the beginning of the php parser so it resets
 the SIGCHLD signal handler before every php script. Now there is only a
 problem with the master server. 
 
 I couldnt find any other significant similarities... just the kernel/glibc
 versions and PHP...

 I did not check 1.3b7 yet but 1.3b6 is buggy :(

 I'm running 1.3.0 for two days now and it seems it works now. With 1.3b6 I
 got 10-15 reports a day from cron about apache failure, now none :)
