Suse Linux 6.1, kernel 2.1.12 Java: blackdown 1.2pre1
>Description:
All bugs in this report are in file JServServletManager. Fixes are included, and
indicated per row as rXXX
**************
To start with the log bug:
r260: "jserv.log.log(CH_INFO,"Destroy timeout: "+this.initTimout+...."
should be this.destroyTimeout!!!
**************
Timout defaults for init and destroy according to zone.properties defaults
should be 10 secs. In JservServletManager they default to 7 secs.
Change 7000 -> 10000 (and 7 secs. to 10 secs. in comment) in rows:
r96, r103, r247, r248
**************
I also encountered a more serious bug:
In one of my servlet zones I have a startup servlets that really takes long to
init. So I set the init.timeout to 30secs. In JServServletManager I saw that
the init.timeout still has to be implemented (r544 on your TODO). But 
implementing this won't help. I tracked down the java-side of JServ, and 
currently due to the TODO there is no timeout. However my servlets gets inited
about every 10 secs. I suspect that the c-side gets impationed and restarts
the JServ java side every 10 secs. or so. I'm not a C programmer, and I can 
only spent some time next week on this problem (and on a suggestion for the
TODO).
