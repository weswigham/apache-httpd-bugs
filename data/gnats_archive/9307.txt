 *** April Heinrichs on JKI Jan. 6.  Studio Guests are Welcome ***
 http://www.backofthenet.com
     April Heinrichs, the US Women's National Team Head Coach, will be our very special guest on "Just Kickin' It" to kickoff the New Year on January 6, 2002. Tune in to 90.3 FM on WHPC from 7:00 am - 9:00 am to hear the show. We'll be inviting a few luck y youth players into the JKI studio to help us interview April. Space will be very limited. If you are interested, E-mail Larry@backofthenet.com. The US WNT will play an international friendly against Mexico, which will be televised on ESPN2 on January 1 2 at 7:00 pm ET and will depart thereafter for China to play from January 23-27, 2002 against China, Germany and Norway in the Four Nations Women's Tournament. China will be hosting the 2003 Women's World Cup, so this gives the younger US women a valuabl e chance to experience the venues, atmosphere and competition. April was the 1991 US WNT captain which team won the Women's World Cup in China in 1991.
 
 Eastern New York will host an Entry Level Instructor course the 2nd weekend
 of February, 2002.  The course will start at 6:00pm on Friday (2/8), and
 will run through early Sunday afternoon (2/10).  The location will be
 southern Westchester (Ardsley or Elmsford ... exact details currently being
 finalized).  We will send location specifics to attendees, along with
 course and accommodation costs.
 
 Please pass along the course information to interested referees.  When they
 contact me (see below), I will send them an application.  All applications
 will need to be submitted by January 31st.
