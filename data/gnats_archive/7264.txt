>Description:
I am attempting to get the vhosting to work, specifically using:
NameVirtualHost and <Vitrual Host ...> directives. I am running an NT4 server behind an ADSL router that redirects traffic happily on port 80 to the server.

The error I get is 
"Error in line # of blah/blah/httpd.conf:
NameVirtualHost not allowed here"

*snippet of httpd.conf*
NameVirtualHost 192.168.1.30
#
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.30>

State-Changed-Why:

It sounds like the configuration snippet you quoted is
inside a block element (eg. <Directory> or <VirtualHost>)
which is not allowed.

If you need additional configuration help, I suggest
you try the newsgroup 
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows

Thanks for using Apache!
