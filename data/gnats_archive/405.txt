Like number 68

I want to set up a single daemon for multiple addresses listening
to diffent ports too. One virtual server should listen to 1.2.3.4
the other to 1.2.3.5:8000 (Port 8000 only). So I included following
directives:

Listen 80
Listen 8000
.
.
.
<VirtualHost 1.2.3.4>
.
.
.
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 1.2.3.5:8000>
.
. (different DocumentRoot and Alias-commands)
.
</VirtualHost>

However, Apache listen to 1.2.3.5:80 too (does not refuse a telnet
connection to 1.2.3.5:80) and returns by request (http://1.2.3.5:80/)
the html-page from http://1.2.3.5:8000/ but should not! It seems
that the port-part auf the VirtualHost-definition does not work.

So I cannot follow your reply to #68 that all works fine.

 Please try apache 1.2b8, there was a bug fix related to listeners in it.
 I think you'll find that your complaints are fixed.
 
 If you specify:
 
 Listen 1.2.3.4:80
 Listen 1.2.3.5:8000
 
 Then that's all it will listen on, which satisfies one of your complaints. 
 The httpd only listens on sockets that you tell it to. 
 
 The <VirtualHost> statements do not specify where the server should listen
 for packets.  It's not possible to use them for that.  They just specify
 how to handle packets that come in on particular addresses.  We invented
 the Listen directive because it is absolutely necessary. There is no
 portable method for the server to determine the optimal sockets to open so
 instead we require the person configuring to do that.
 
 For example it takes only one socket to listen to all addresses, port 80. 
 But if you want to listen to specific addresses it takes as many sockets
 as addresses you wish to listen to.  There's no way for the server to know
 what addresses are on your server, so it has to be told where to listen.

State-Changed-Why:
User reports that 1.2b8 clears up at least the config/listening
problems.  But 1.2b8 introduces a problem where the httpd
stops answering after a few hours.  I've asked him to submit
a new ticket for that since it is likely an AIX problem.
