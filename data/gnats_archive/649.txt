>Description:
If type maps are set to issue a redirect instead of performing an
internal redirect, proxies should be able to cache the result.  This
doesn't really make sense for MultiViews because of the extra extension,
but type maps deal with normal URIs.

I added a ``RedirectPre1.1TypeMappedDocs'' option (ugly lookin', but I
couldn't think of a better name) and twiddled the machinery in 
handle_map_file.

If the rcsdiff patch doesn't translate for some reason, it's also at
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~ejr/mod_negotiation.c.patch.

Yeah, this is kinda silly, but who knows how long it'll be before other
browsers use HTTP/1.1...

State-Changed-Why:
Cacheing the result of negotiated resources is usually not a good
idea because proxies or browsers will cache one variant when
others might be better for subsequent requests. If you
really want to make the response cacheable you can use
the CacheNegotiatedDocs, which also only applies to
HTTP/1.0 and earlier requests. Why do you want to
issue redirects instead of making the response itself
cacheable? Unless there is a good reason for this, we will
prefer not to implement your RedirectPre1.1TypeMappedDocs
directive.

Incidently, the only time when it is safe to cache the response of
negotiation is when multiviews is being used and there is
a single variant with a matching filename (for example, to
map requests for /index to /index.html). Apache 1.3 will
mark the results of such negotiation as cacheable.

 Oh well.  And pcs@hyperreal.org writes:

 It's ok...  I _know_ I had a reason for it, but I can't
 remember it now.  The better fix is probably to add the
 valid request headers into the proxy's hash, anyways.
