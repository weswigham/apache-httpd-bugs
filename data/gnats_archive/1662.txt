NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 
Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 10.20.6166 for 80x86
>Description:
I like to compile the Apache 1.3b3 new because I need the "LoadModule" 
program which is not in the bin distribution.
I extract the tar ball and do :
E:\tmp\apache\apache_1.3b3\src>  nmake -f Makefile.nt installr

Microsoft (R) Program Maintenance Utility   Version 1.62.7022
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1988-1997. All rights reserved.

        cd os\win32
        set CFG=ApacheOS - Win32 Release
        nmake /nologo -f ApacheOS.mak
        cl.exe @f:\TMP\nma00163.
Command line error D2021 : invalid numeric argument '/FD'
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'cl.exe' : return code '0x2'
Stop.
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'd:\etc\NMAKE.EXE' : return code '0x2'
Stop.
