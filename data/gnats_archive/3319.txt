State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri Oct 30 15:53:34 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug.  " " is not valid in a request and it must
be encoded.  Spaces seperate the method from the URI from
the protocol, so Apache is perfectly correct to work as it
does.
