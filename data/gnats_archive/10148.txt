>Environment:
Chinese Windows NT 4.0, SP 5.0
>Description:
I just downloaded the no-src.msi version of Apache HTTP server 1.3.23.
I tried to start the server by starting apache.exe from dos prompt with either
the original httpd.conf or adding Listen 8080.  In either case, the server died
after one minute and give the following messages in the error.log:
This is the same as PR 5298 reported, except that I am using Win NT instead of
Win 98:

[Tue Mar 12 13:01:11 2002] [crit] (10045)(FormatMessage failed with code 317): Parent: WSADuplicateSocket failed for socket 212.
[Tue Mar 12 13:01:11 2002] [error] (2)No such file or directory: master_main: create child process failed. Exiting.
[Tue Mar 12 13:02:11 2002] [error] forcing termination of child #0 (handle 308)
>How-To-Repeat:
No URL required.
The server died by itself
>Fix:
I need advise.
