RedHat Linux 6.2
>Description:
Attempting to browse an ftp site which uses MACOS Webstar ftp server gives
either an empty directory or a "invalid gateway" error.

This ftp server has a few unusual behaviours:

- attempting to GET a directory returns a 450 status not 550

- a SIZE operation on a directory succeeds but gives zero size

- MAC filenames can begin with "-" so LIST qualifiers look like filenames.
>How-To-Repeat:
connect to ftp://195.243.137.70 with and without a trailing slash.
