>Description:
the apache document:
http://www.apache.org/docs-1.2/misc/howto.html#redirect

has an example Perl redirector:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

        print "Status: 302 Moved Temporarily\r
        Location: http://www.some.where.else.com/\r\n\r\n";


but IE3.0 fails because the \r embedded instance is not
parsed correctly.  Also, a literal leading-space in a Header: field is often interpeted in RFC-land
as meaning a continuation line, and not a new Header instance in itself (eg SMTP/NNTP)

Additionally,  print appears to collide with other Header: instances
and the output datastream is not well-formed.
>How-To-Repeat:
try browsing onto any site using this syntax, where Apache
is emitting Date: and Server: headers as well, and test with
IE3.0 as well as Netscape 4.0 and IE4.0 clients	
>Fix:
use printf STDOUT "Status: 302 Moved Temporarily\r\nLocation: http://www.some.where.else.com/\r\n\r\n";
this appears to fix the \r problem, and also ensures the write to output is a single event which is not
interrupted by any other header: lines.
