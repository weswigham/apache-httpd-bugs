>Description:
isapi_handler() in mod_isapi.c refuses requests that contain more than 48K of data.  I think it's time to raise the limit or remove it entirely.

The following appears in the code (in Apache 2.0a4 as well as 1.3.12):

	/* Unlike IIS, which limits this to 48k, we read the whole
	 * sucker in. I suppose this could be bad for memory if someone
	 * uploaded the complete works of Shakespeare. Well, WebSite
	 * does the same thing.
	 */
	long to_read = atol(ap_table_get(e, "CONTENT_LENGTH"));
	long read;

	/* Actually, let's cap it at 48k, until we figure out what
	 * to do with this... we don't want a Content-Length: 1000000000
	 * taking out the machine.
	 */

The first comment no longer reflects reality.  I've tested with requests over 300K, and IIS 5.0 passes them along to my ISA intact.  If there's a limit, I don't know what it is.

The second comment presumably could be applied to requests to CGI scripts as well, but cgi_handler() doesn't appear to limit the size of requests that it will handle.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a form that submits over 48K of data to an ISA.  Any old ISA will do, since it won't actually receive the data.
>Fix:
In the interest of consistency and usefulness, I'd suggest removing the limit in mod_isapi.c by deleting the following lines (245-255):

	/* Actually, let's cap it at 48k, until we figure out what
	 * to do with this... we don't want a Content-Length: 1000000000
	 * taking out the machine.
	 */

	if (to_read > 49152) {
	    if (isapi_term) (*isapi_term)(HSE_TERM_MUST_UNLOAD);
	    FreeLibrary(isapi_handle);
	    return HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE;
	}

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Sun Aug  6 08:32:06 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

This behavior is by design.  Larger (or unlimited) immediate
acceptance would subject the server to attack via memory
flood.  Apache 2.0 may include the ReadClient support to
retrieve the remaining transmision, perhaps a config param
to change this default, but there are no promises yet.
Please email (don't reply to this bug report) if you would
be interested in testing such changes for 2.0.
