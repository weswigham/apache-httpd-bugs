State-Changed-Why:
Please use a current version of Apache.  The version you are
using is years out of date.

In this case, it appears like your compiler isn't properly
installed but as we state before you submit a bug report,
you need to use the current version first.

 You are trying an awfully _old_ version of apache. You might want to
 fetch 1.3.6 from www.apache.org before continuing.
 
 As to this error; I've seen this on HP before when the native includes
 gets mixed which Gcc's includes. For example if you compile/configure gcc
 with no '--prefix' and later install/move it from its normal/default
 /usr/local.. location to some other place. Have you ever compliled any
 other 'complex' third party software, for example perl or mSQL on the
 machine ?
