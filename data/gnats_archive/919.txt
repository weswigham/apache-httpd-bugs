>Description:
With Apache 1.2, you can use multiple servernames in a virtual host.  The problem is, the script alias does not work for anything but the last servername.  IE in my setup I have in httpd.conf (redirect, log, etc. not listed below):



<VirtualHost defiant.questgate.net>

DocumentRoot /home/httpd/https-defiant/docs

ServerName defiant.questgate.net

ServerName questgate.net

ServerName questgate.com

ServerName www.questgate.com

ServerName defiant.questgate.com

ServerName www.questgate.net

ScriptAlias /dcgi/ /home/httpd/https-defiant/docs/cgi-bin/



now when i go to www.questgate.net/dcgi/ i can use the cgi;s

if i go to like www.questgate.com/dcgi/, it says file not found...but all the web pages, etc. come up...just cant use script alias
>How-To-Repeat:
www.questgate.net - the top banner is an included cgi

questgate.com - same, but the top doesnt work

That's not how servername works... it can have only one value.
See ServerAlias.
