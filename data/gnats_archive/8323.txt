>How-To-Repeat:
Following the instructions from the mod_perl-2.0 pod docs, as follows:
 % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co httpd-2.0
        % cd httpd-2.0/srclib
        % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co apr
        % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co apr-util
        % cd ..
        % ./buildconf
       
... Things stopped as noted above at the buildconf stage - not sure if this is a problem with the apr and apr-util parts.
>Fix:
I'm afraid I can't suggest any way to fix this. My stone-age attempt consisted of commenting out the offending lines inthe configure file. This did not work.

>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Thu Sep 27 17:03:40 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This looks very similar to a common problem that happens
when you install libtool 1.3 over the top of libtool 1.4.
Libtool 1.3 has more files than libtool 1.4, and they
conflict with each other.  Please make sure that you 
have a clean libtool 1.4 installation.
