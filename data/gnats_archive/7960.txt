Used a binary distribution (no compiling involved).
>Description:
Wanted to upgrade from 1.3.14 to 1.3.20 in order to get Apache running as a service. Downloaded the binary MSI installation, installed it. Went smoothly. Started Apache, so the test page OK. Replaced DocumentRoot and top level <Directory> to my web page root, "E:/wwwroot". Restarted and got 403 Forbidden error. In error.log, got this line per each request:

[Fri Jun 29 17:34:49 2001] [error] [client 172.30.38.137] (22)Invalid argument: cannot read directory for multi: e:/wwwroot/

Removed MultiViews. Then started getting

[Fri Jun 29 17:49:27 2001] [error] [client 172.30.38.137] (22)Invalid argument: Can't open directory for index: e:/wwwroot/

Switched DocumentRoot and top level <Directory> to some other directory on the same drive. Everything rus smoothly. Switched back to wwwroot - the same problem again.

Double checked my spelling -- it is okay, "e:/wwwroot" exists and points to the proper place.

Finally, copied my config from 1.3.14 instead of this almost fresh one (no other changes except for these two). Still didn't work -- with the same message, what's weird.

Sorry, this is an Intranet version only - I don't have any external thing to repeat this on.
>Fix:
No idea.
