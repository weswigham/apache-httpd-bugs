>Organization:
>Environment:
Solaris 8 on UltraSparc gcc 2.95.2
>Description:
Cgi programs within the main docroot are not getting run through suexec. programs
called from user's directories go through suexec just fine. programs attampted to run
who are outside public_html and the main docroot, suexec makes an error saying that
the command is outside the docroot.

Programs called from the main docroot just get executed as if suexec was disabled.
It appears that suexec doesnt even get called in this condition.
>How-To-Repeat:
compile out of box w/suexec. add ExecCGI to docroot and add .cgi handeler
any .cgi progs run w/o suexec
>Fix:
Unless this is the correct behaviour.. I dont see any reason why it should be skipping
over the docroot stuff.
BTW the doc page fo suexec is _very_ scarce as far as behavior (maybe its supposed to do this?!?)
and examples and error explinations. That should be fixed

State-Changed-Why:

Yes, the suexec docs are a little sketchy.  However,
what you are asking for does not make any sense.
If the request is for the main server, not under
any vhost, then what user and group would suexec
change to?  (That is a rhetorical question ;-)

If you to use suexec on the main server, you should
configure a vhost to catch requests for the main
server and place the appropriate User and Group
directive in the vhost.

Thanks for using Apache.

 It makes sense to me *grin*. In my senerio, I am the admin for the
 server only, not content. The server runs as websrv. There are several
 vhosts, as well as many userdir pages. But, there is still one 'main'
 page for the site (docroot), which is maintained by other various random
 persons (not me). The main docroot is owned by webadmin. (therfore
 someone else than the server is running). As the admin, I want the
 security feature of suexec for _all_ cgi, as i am very afraid of
 whatever crazy ideas the users may come up with in their code. The
 docroot would be included since it is maintained by others. What is can
 do is probablly just convert the docroot into a vhost like you said, and
 it should work find. In theory though, even if the docroot and httpd
 were owned by the same person, it would be nice to have suexec do the
 sanity checks against the cgi, even if it dosnt end up suing to anyone
 different.
 
 Just a thought :)
