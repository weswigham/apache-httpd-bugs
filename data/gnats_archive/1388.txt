I would like to know what files we need to download to run apache on an 
HP-9000/829 , HP-UX 10.00?  Where are they located in the download
web page?  What version of apache would we need to run on an HP-9000?

State-Changed-Why:
Pick one of the tarchives from <http://www.apache.org/dist/>,
unpack it, and read the src/INSTALL file.  I recommend
the 1.2.4 release rather than 1.3b2 if you've never done
this before.

You *must* have an ANSI C compiler in order to build the
Apache Web server.  If your system doesn't have one, you
can get GNU C from the net; Apache builds just fine with
that.
