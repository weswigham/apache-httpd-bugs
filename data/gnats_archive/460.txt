Solaris 2.5, Sun-C-Compiler, Version doesn't matter
>Description:
My Apache doesn't like password-files, that have more than two columns
separated by a colon ":". I would like to use the /etc/passwd-file or the
password-file I used for my CERN-httpd (It has three columns.).
>How-To-Repeat:
Use /etc/passwd as AuthUserFile and try to access a protected URL.
>Fix:
Change line 106 in mod_auth.c (that's the return-statement of get_pw()) from:
    return pstrdup (r->pool, rpw);
to:
    return getword(r->pool, &rpw, ':');

mod_auth then works for password-files with two columns as well as with
three and more columns.%0

Thank you for the information.  We will see about
implementing this in a future release; it's too late
