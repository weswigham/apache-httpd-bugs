>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
I use the Apache 1.3.20 for Win32 precompiled. I have a Win95 OSr2.
>Description:
CGIs as *.cgi instead *.exe add one white space in empty lines of HTTP response (including headers).
>How-To-Repeat:
I add the
AddHandler cgi-script .exe
to use *.exe also with *.cgi exeacutable modules.
But when I execute the SAME *.exe renamed to *.cgi, then a white space character (0x20) is appended to ALL empty lines of the response (headers and body response). So the result is not HTTP valid response.
>Fix:
Review mod_cgi.
