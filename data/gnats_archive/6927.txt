SunOS irad-rms 5.6 Generic_105181-15 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-250 
>Description:
Any servelets that I try to execute (including Hello and IsItWorking), are returned 
to me as application/octet-stream, even though the servlets correctly specify 
text/html.  Because it is application/octet-stream, my browser prompts me to save
the file.  If I open that file it has the correct output of the servelet, but
with binary characters added.

The default mime type for apache is text/plain so it's not just reverting to default.
>How-To-Repeat:
Behind a firewall or I would give you a URL.
>Fix:
Configuration issue?  The servelets are setting their content type properly but
apache is sending application/octet-stream instead.
