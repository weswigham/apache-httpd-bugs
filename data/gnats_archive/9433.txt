>Description:
I had an apache server (DAV/1.0.2 configured) working very well until yesterday, when I tried to make some small changes in httpd.conf. I restored the httpd.conf backup, but the DBM auth doesn't work anymore. 

My httpd.conf file :
User kirschpi
Group opera
...
<IfModule mod_dav.c>
    DAVLockDB /var/log/httpd/DAVLock
    DAVMinTimeout 600
    Alias /pub /var/www/html/pub
    <Location /pub>
    	#EnablePut On
    	DAV On
    	AuthType Basic
    	AuthName DAVPUT
    	AuthDBMUserFile /etc/httpd/conf/users
    	EnableDelete Off
    	umask 007
    	<Limit PUT>
		require valid-user
	</Limit>
     </Location>
</IfModule>

My user file (created by a perl script - I used ddb for verify it):
lrwxrwxrwx    1 kirschpi opera           8 Jan 10 16:30 users -> users.db
-rw-r--r--    1 kirschpi opera       12288 Jan 10 15:48 users.db

And for any user, the athentication fails for DBM and in the error.log the following message appears:
[Thu Jan 10 16:31:26 2002] [error] [client 194.199.20.198] (-30990)Unknown error 4294936306: could not open dbm auth file: /etc/httpd/conf/users
[Thu Jan 10 16:31:26 2002] [error] [client 194.199.20.198] DBM user kirsch not found: /var/www/html/pub/tst/I.html

And, also, the following message appeared in error.log when I restarted the server :
[Wed Jan  9 17:54:12 2002] [notice] Apache/1.3.22 (Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) DAV/1.0.2 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Wed Jan  9 17:54:12 2002] [notice] suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: /usr/sbin/suexec)
[Wed Jan  9 17:54:12 2002] [notice] Accept mutex: sysvsem (Default: sysvsem)

How may I resolve this? It's urgent!

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.

[Personalized Hint]
You must have rebuild apache with the wrong dbm option to
./configure so it no longer recognizes the same database
type as it once did.  Given that ./configure tries to
autodetect supported dbm managers, it probably picked up
a dbm flavor you installed since you first configured apache.

 Hi!
 That's is also a problem, because I used RPM packages to install and 
 update Apache (so, I didn't build it myself).. :( Now, I'm trying to 
 build it with mod_put, mod_dav and mod_perl with no sucess... Do you now 
 if the binaries available in apache.org site have been built without the 
 suexec option (and with apxs facility)? And how can I tell to configure 
 procedure that my databases are NDBM databases?
