>Description:
let assume, that we have standard-installed apache 1.2.4,
with one only change in config : will use
Listen 80
Listen 8010
instead of usual Port 80. Let's make directory htdocs/foo, and then
try to retrieve http://some.host:8010/foo (note, that there is no trailing slash!).
The result will be "Moved Permanent", as it expected, but in Location
field we found: Location: http://some.host/foo/ - the requested port is forgotten.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above. You can try to repeat it even on www.apache.org :)
>Fix:
fast and dirty hack: that patch is to mod_dir.c

 This is what the Port directive is intended for.  Apache only supports
 servers with one canonical hostname:port.
 
 <VirtualHost *:8010>
 Port 8010
 </VirtualHost>
 
 is probably what you want.

State-Changed-Why:
Do you still have a "Port" directive in your configuration
files?  Because that specifies the default port to be used
on redirects; they do *not* inherit the port of the original
request.

User reports problem resolved.  No, the way Apache deals
with ports is sometimes... unexpected.

 May be we are differs with the meaning of 'support', but, as for 
 me, some Listen directives and using <VirtualHost hostname:*>
 means that: apache supports 'main' servername:(some ports, on which
 the connections are accepted) and some 'virtual' servers, each
 configured with only one <VirtualHost hostname:*> directive means, 
 that apache supports servers with multiple ports on each hostname. 
 In all cases, but that :)

 Well, now my httpd.conf looks like (the final part of, 
 all the Listen directives are commented out) :
 
 <VirtualHost *:8110>
 ServerName localhost
 Port 8110
 </VirtualHost>
 /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf: 281 lines, 9425 characters.
 bash# killall httpd
 bash# /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd
 bash#       
 
 but i can't see any listener of that port... 
 
 bash# netstat -an | grep 8110
 bash# telnet localhost 8110
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
 bash#         
 
 Anyway, thanks for your reply.
 
 PS: the full netstat -an : there are squid, and some others, but..

 Listen just means "accept connections at this address:port".  The Port
 directive in the main server is overloaded to support NCSA files (this is
 documented in the port directive).  Port and ServerName together define
 the canonical name for the main server or vhost.  And as I mentioned... 
 apache only supports one canonical name... it wouldn't be "canonical"
 otherwise ;)  It could do other things, it just doesn't for historical
 reasons.

 You need to use Listen as well.
