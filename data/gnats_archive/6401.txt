State-Changed-Why:
I have finally seen this on my own computer.  On my machine,
it was happening because my root partition was low on inodes, so
I couldn't write to /tmp.  This will make MM's configure
script fail with this error.  Could you please make sure that
you have plenty of space and inode's in your temp directory
and try to configure again?  I have successfully run this on
an HPUX 11 system in the past.
