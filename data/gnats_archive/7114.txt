>Description:
I am experiencing a bug in Apache.
We are running apache 1.3.12 and are using basic authentication. We use the DirectoryIndex directive (who doesn’t) so that users don’t have to type in “index.html” after our hostname.
In the webserver’s htdocs directory (DocumentRoot) we have specified: 
 
File .htaccess:
 
AuthType      Basic
AuthName      "my realm"
AuthUserFile /home/jkuif/web/conf/users
AuthGroupFile /home/jkuif/web/conf/groups
 
<Files index.html>
require valid-user
</Files>
 
 
With this configuration we experience the following problem:
 
1) A user enters the URL: www.example.com
2) The webserver will send a authentication page, but WITHOUT the WWW-Authenticate header.
3) In Internet Explorer 5.0 this missing header will result in the show of the HTML content of the http answer.
 
With a packetanalyser i see the following traffic:
 
16:40:57.706625  []  10.20.6.45.1356 > www.example.com.8091

    This server could not verify that you
    are authorized to access the document

    credentials (e.g., bad password), or your

I tested the same configuration on 1.3.14, with the same results. So, with the configuration above, Apache knows it has to send the authentication stuff, but forgets to send the correct (WWW-
Authenticate) header. This flaw is only resulting in a problem with IE5. IE5 does not pop up a user/passwd dialog.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the DirectoryIndex directive and use a htaccess file with a authentication configuration as described in "full description"
>Fix:
Apache is able to see that it has to send a authentication page, but only forgets to send the header, i think it won't be a problem to fix it.
