>Description:
Playing with Oracle8i EJB's and Oracle JDeveloper 2.0 sample program 'acmevideo'

Placed jar file only on repositories line,
it would find the base class, but would throw a classnotfound exception later on
when it tried to load a class dynamically.
adding the Jar File to the wrappers.classpath fixed the problem

maybe repositries are not placed in system classpath???
>How-To-Repeat:
With a machine with Oracle8i/JDeveloper Installed 
(both available off Oracles Technet Site)
maybe loading a class (which is in the repositry jar file) dynamically
>Fix:
add repositries to class path

 repositories are not placed in the system classpath. That is the way that it
 works. This is not a bug.
