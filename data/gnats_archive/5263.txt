>Description:
My site is running Infoseek's UltraSEEK search engine.  In the process of its indexing, I noticed a problem in the way Apache parses URLs.  The best way to describe this is with an example.  This is a CORRECT URL:

     http://www.nara.gov/regional/seattle.html

However, due to a badly-coded link, the search engine tried urls like:

     http://www.nara.gov/regional/seattle.html/volunteer/contacts/seainfo.html
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And oddly enough, these worked!  Apache always returned the original page (seattle.html), even with the "junk" appended to the URL (the ^underlined^ part of the URL).  I would have expected Apache to return a 404.  This is wreaking havoc with the search engine because it's going into infinite loops and indexing pages (like the seattle.html page) millions of times.  Also, this messes up what the browser thinks the document's base URL is, so images are broken on these pages.

This seems to happen even on your own site:

http://www.apache.org/index.html/blah/lasdkj/asdjhkjasjad
returns the same page as http://www.apache.org/index.html

I have also tried this with IIS and Netscape Enterprise Server--both of which return 404.
>How-To-Repeat:
(see full description for more examples)
     http://www.apache.org/index.html/blah/lasdkj/asdjhkjasjad 
returns the same page as 
     http://www.apache.org/index.html 
instead of an error.
>Fix:
My guess is that Apache is allowing certain delimiters after the .html that it shouldn't.  '?' obviously should work, but I don't think '/' should, at least not for non-CGI pages.

State-Changed-Why:
It is supposed to work that way.  If you have SSIs enabled, then
the ability to add path info after the filename is a feature
and allows SSIs to do more complex processing.
