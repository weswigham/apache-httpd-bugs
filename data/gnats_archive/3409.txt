>Description:
ap_md5_binary() (in util_md5.c) uses sprintf to convert the hash to hex form,
but this is pretty slow (mod_digest spends ove 10% of its time in this sprintf).
The simple attached patch solves this.

 Erm, let me modify that patch slightly - using an array for "hex" is
 stupid... Sorry.
