>Description:

There are some documents which are accessed after the right username and 
password are given. How can I access the username in the .htaccess, 
so that after a correct login the username will automatically be inserted in
all of the documents which the user will then use?
>How-To-Repeat:
Suppose I have a web mail account as  mukoma@.... then after a successful login 
I get something like "3 unread messages for mukoma "
Or when I log out I get something like "mukoma logged out" 
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
This is not the appropriate place for asking such questions.

It is nonsensical to just say "I want the name to be inserted"
without saying exactly how you are generating dynamic content.
If it is CGI or SSI, then you can use the REMOTE_USER environment
variable.
