>Environment:
SunOS 5.6 
>Description:
I tried looking in the Problem report database for pspell/aspell and libpspell-modules.so.1issues but found none.
I have been running into a wall installing the pspell/aspell ability with php/apache. I did the install on linux 6.2 and that went through fine. Its only when we try to add it on our SunOS 5.6 boxes that issues begin to happen, pspell/aspell and php installations got through without a problem. But i hit a tragic error with apache install: here is a snapshot of what we have
 
software:
apache_1.3.14
php-4.0.3pl1
pspell-.11.2
pspell-ispell-.10.2
aspell-.32.6
added configurations:
aspell: ./configure --disable-static && make
php: ./configure --with-apache=../apache --with-mysql=/local/mysql --enable-debug=no --enable-trans-sid --with-pspell
apache: ./configure --prefix=/local/apache --enable-module=ssl --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a --enable-module=php4
 
I get this error on the make for apache :
./gen_test_char >test_char.h
ld.so.1: ./gen_test_char: fatal: libpspell-modules.so.1: open failed: No such file or directory
Killed
make[3]: *** [test_char.h] Error 137
make[2]: *** [subdirs] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/local/home/admin/src/apache_1.3.14/src'
make[1]: *** [build-std] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/local/home/admin/src/apache_1.3.14'
make: *** [build] Error 2
 
libpspell-modules.so.1 is in my path: declare -x PATH="/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/etc/lib"
 
 
Any help would be appreciated . . . . Thank you

>Fix:
No idea. . . i am betting that this is a path issue but i don't see how, that module exists in my path and has the correct permissions . .
