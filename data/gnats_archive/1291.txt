(Don't worry - this isn't the standard "my CGI program doesn't work" whinge!)

Problems with a CGI script (such as incorrect interpreter paths, wrong or
missing headers, or any of the thousand and one things people get wrong)
fail with a '500 Internal Server Error' code.

  The person browsing (or even the person writing the script), then reports
this "server problem" to the webmaster, whereas the problem actually lies with
the script itself.
>How-To-Repeat:
Choose a random CGI script on almost any web server!
>Fix:
)Return a distinct C function error code, and hence a distinct HTTP return code.
The server can then be configured to display a suitable error page, script, etc.

The source files affected are 'http_protocol.c' and 'httpd.h' (defining the
return codes) and 'mod_cgi.c' and 'util_script.c' (invoking these codes.)

A patch file is available - let me know if you want it.

 This is an assumption that may not necessarily be correct in a particular
 situation.
   As far as the external user is concerned, something went wrong and they
 need to be able to report it to the appropriate person - they don't really
 care who.  Ideally, this should be the person who actully maintains the CGI
 script, who need not be the overall webmaster  (otherwise the webmaster has
 to determine who's responsible, and pass on the comment - all extra work).
 
   With the apache server as distributed, it isn't possible to make this
 distinction.   The patch I offer (appended) allows this to be configured,
 thus allowing this possibility if a particular site so chooses.
 
   The other time this is useful is when a server is being used to teach
 CGI programming.  In this situation, the "external user" is likely to be
 the person writing the script - in which case they do need to know that
 the CGI went wrong, rather than a "real" server error.
   This is the scenario that led to the development of this patch here.
 The webmasters were getting a steady stream of "server problem" reports,
 which all stemmed from minor CGI errors.  By distinguishing these two cases,
 we are able to provide a "CGI error" web page, which includes advice on
 identifying and solving the problem.

   OK - appended below.
 
   I believe that this (very simple) patch offers a useful additional
 capability, without impacting in any significant way on those who do
 not wish to use it.

 I'm not sure how your suggested change improves on this.  All it does is
 give a different error message to the client which isn't much more
 informative from their point of view; they don't care if it is a CGI or
 some other error.

 If someone is developing CGIs, then they should be smart enough to be able
 to look at the error log and see what it says.  
 
 Your patch is useful in some cases, but it has the disadvantage of using
 up another status code which, at some point in the future, may cause
 conflicts and of being quite limited; there are many many different errors
 that can cause a 500, and if you start having a seperate error code for
 each it just gets unworkable.
 
 What could be an option, however, is a config option that lets you have an
 error message similar to that which goes in the error log included in the
 internal error page.  This would provide, in combination with an
 ErrorDocument and passing it in an environment variable, essentially the
 same net result without introducing something that is so specialized.
 This has been considered but no finished implementation has been submitted
 yet.

 You could also use an ErrorDocument which points at a CGI, the CGI should
 have the original URI available in one of the environment variables (I
 forget which, you'll have to experiment).  Then your CGI can make a
 decision as to who to contact ... such as grabbing a ~username.
 
 yeah, use something like:
 
 ErrorDocument 500 /cgi-bin/500response
 
 And 500response should be a script which plays with REDIRECT_REQUEST_URI.

 Yes, but that assumes that all "internal" errors that refer to ~username
 are necessarily what I tagged CGI errors.  It would hide the (hopefully
 rare) case when there was a *real* internal error, that the webmaster needed
 to look at, but that was triggered by a personal cgi URL.
 
   Not to mention the additional complication in having to parse the
 request to determine the username, et al.   Having a distinct, and simple
 return code would be much simpler - either the main return code as I
 originally proposed, or an internal additional one as suggested yesterday.

 The default message is very similar, certainly.
 
 But because it uses a different error code, the webmaster for the site
 can configure the server to return a different error page, using the
 ErrorDocument configuration option.

 That's fine for experienced CGI programmers, who can interpret the log
 entries correctly.  But we are teaching novice CGI programmers, who are
 only just starting to learn the trade.  I want to be able to point them
 towards some useful hints (like running the debugging version of cgiwrap).
 
   Maybe I'm just cynical after several years in University technical support,
 but I suspect you have a higher opinion of students' abilities than I have.
 (Don't be bitchy, Dave!)

 Fair comment.
 I wouldn't have suggested it if you hadn't already used 506, which doesn't
 appear in any HTTP standard I could see.  I assumed it was an apache special.
  
 >         and of being quite limited; there are many many different errors

 Yes, but very few (IMHO) that are likely to be the responsibility of anyone
 other than the Web administrator.   Which was the main impetus behind
 distinguishing this one specially.

 That would perhaps be useable, though it could be a bit messy to interpret
 a general error string of that sort.
 
 An alternative approach (perhaps in conjunction with the above) might be to
 return "500 Internal error" throughout, but have an environmental variable
 containing a simple (numeric?) "sub-error" code, to distinguish the various
 causes of internal errors.
   This could then be used by an ErrorDocument script to tailor the output
 error page appropriately.
   Being totally private to the implementation, it wouldn't be affected by
 future extensions to the HTTP protocol.
 
   Does this strike you as a plausible option?

This has been addressed for the next release after 1.3.1
by putting text describing the cause of the problem into
the *ERROR_NOTES envariable.  An "ErrorDocument 500" script
can use this information, along with the other envariables
it is given, to be more specific about what went wrong.
Thank you for the report, and for using Apache!
