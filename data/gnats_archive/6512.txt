OS: Windows 98 SE (4.10.2222A) Russian
>Description:
I cannot create my own script-parsers, which are invoked on URLs of files
with special extensions.

Lines
     AddHandler mynewaction .my
     Action mynewaction "C:/my.exe" 
should makje Apache execute C:/my.exe "full path to .my file"
on any file with .my extension
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Clean Install of Win32 Apache 1.3.12 to C:\Apache

2. In conf/httpd.conf change/add only:
ServerName 127.0.0.1   
AddHandler mynewaction .my
Action mynewaction "C:/my.exe" 
3. Create my.exe in the C:/ - win32-console .exe, which writes "content-type:text/html\n\n nothing"

4. In C:/Apache/htdocs create empty file named test.my

5. Run your browser (I have russian IE 5.0) and type URL 127.0.0.1/test.my

In the document root (C:/Apache/htdocs) a file called test.my (empty) is created.
Then local apache 
 

>Fix:
It's a bug with Action directive,
 I tested it with Apache 1.3.11 & 1.3.12 - all binaries
Also if I write Action "/my.exe" in httpd.conf, it says

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Sep 10 10:47:24 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Action takes a URL fragment (eg. /cgi-bin/foo) as an argument, 
not a filesystem path.  You need to setup your script to be
executable as a CGI from a client, then set the server to use 
that same path.

 It seems that it appends Action's param to url, but not executes an exe!!!
