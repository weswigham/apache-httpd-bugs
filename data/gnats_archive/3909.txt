is it me or is that not a usertrack cookie?  it should look something like RMID=c0ce946e36cae2e0 right?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
don't know, there weren't any issues during compilation, no complaints in any error logs, and everything else seems to be working swimmingly.  the only issue is that these logged numbers are unique for every request and we can't really track sessions in that manner...

 Please ignore this, I've described the wrong problem.  It goes as follows:
 
 We've got Apache 1.3.4 set up as a reverse proxy caching server.  The
 usertrack module is generating and logging new IDs for each incoming
 request, but the cookies are NOT being issued to end users.  Is this a bug?
 I think it should issue cookies, because all of our logging needs to be done
 on this server.
