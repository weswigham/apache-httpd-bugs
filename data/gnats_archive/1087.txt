>Environment:
Redhat Linux 4.0, kernel 2.0.25, no special stuff installed. 
Apache complied with gcc 2.7.2, with modules mod_rewrite and mod_proxy in
addition to all the default modules.

uname -a says:
Linux vtoff1.vocaltec.com 2.0.25 #2 Fri Jan 17 17:56:03 EST 1997 i586
>Description:
After running fine for a while, one of the child processes will go berserk, 
take up all available cpu cycles, writing the same error to the disk over and 
over again:
[Fri Aug 29 22:20:59 1997] select: (listen): Bad address

Using strace on the process gives:
write(17, "[Tue Sep  2 14:10:32 1997] selec"..., 57) = 57
oldselect(16, [15], NULL, NULL, NULL)   = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
time(NULL)                              = 873223832

The server behaves very sluggish after it starts, though nothing really breaks 
and no coredump is generated.

Sending the root process SIGHUP seems to clean the problem up.
>How-To-Repeat:
No easy way, it appears after the server is running for about
13 hours from the last hangup.
>Fix:
Sorry, nope. I don't have enough time to get into the code

 We've had this reported many times under linux but there's nothing that we
 can find in the code that causes it, and it's only reported by linux folk.
 So I strongly suspect a kernel problem.

State-Changed-Why:
As Dean says, this appears to be a Linux kernel problem.
Apache could handle it in a better manner, but doesn't because
the implementation of that would be quite difficult in the
current framework.

Try upgrading your kernel to 2.0.30.

If that doesn't help, I'm afraid there really isn't too
much we can do to help.  This problem normally appears only
on Linux and we have no reason to suspect it is caused by
a problem in the Apache code.

 The following patch was applied to the code to work around this problem.
