>Description:
the Apache API function ap_table_add() seems to replace values for the same key
rather than adding a new entry with the same _key_ but a another value! Thus,
a code fragment like the following doesn't workm the way I'd need it:
for(i=0; i < max; i++) { ap_table_add(r->subprocess_env,"Key",Val[i].string);}
What shows up using the printenv cgi script is the last added value (, prepended
with REDIRECT_). I've tried using the ap_table_set() function with the same _key_
before the for-loop because similar hash implementations in other systmes required it,
but it didn't work. 
>How-To-Repeat:
My setup is a self-written (auth)module which uses ap_table_add() to set env vars
in request_req->subprocess_env to pass them to an ErrorDocument: in the mod, 
ap_table_add() is called in a for-loop, after the for-loop HTT_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
is returned which starts a the "printenv" CGI-script, set using "ErrorDocument 500 /cgi-bin/printenv".
>Fix:
To me, it seems like ap_table_add() is broken.

State-Changed-Why:

No, ap_table_add() adds a new key/value pair to the
list.  When the environment table is constructed for
a CGI script or something similar, only one of those
values can be used.  How are you expecting to get multiple
evariables with the same name but different values?  If
you step through the table in your code, after adding a
list of values, you'll find that all of the key/value
pairs are there -- but many things can only deal with
a single one, and will end up taking either the first or
the last depending upon implementation.
