>Description:
If i specify %{Server_Name}e in a logformat directive, I get the appropriate
output in the logfile, but if I use %{SERVER_NAME}, then only a - is generated.

This appears to be the case for any other environment variable I have tried.

The documentation seems to imply that environment variables should be
in uppercase (e.g. http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats):
%...{FOOBAR}e:  The contents of the environment variable FOOBAR

Also, the output from /cgi-bin/printenv (as supplied with the apache
distribution), prints all environment variables in uppercase.

but apache seems to work otherwise.

Am I missing something here?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try logging environment variables in the logformat directive, and see if
you get output if the variable is specified in uppercase.

>Fix:
Amend the documentation or code, or don't make case sensitive?
