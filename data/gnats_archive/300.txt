>Environment:
I have a Netra Sun with Solaris 2.4
>Description:
I have two programs in Perl, one Counter and one FormMail, the counter gives me 
image corrupted on the home page, while the FormMail gives me this error: 
"Bad Referrer - Access Denied The form that is trying to use this FormMail 
Program resides at: http://www.pcb.it/test.html, which is not allowed to access this cgi script. Sorry!" 

I don't know if I made a mistake during the configuration of Virtualhost, and
I attach to this from the configuration:
 - access.conf - 
<Directory /home/pcb/htdocs>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
Sure, you can try to this address:
http://www.pcb.it/test.html
Try to fill in the form and you will get the error.
>Fix:
I haven't idea how to solve the problem.
Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
Can you supply the URL of the page that's displaying
`corrupted' images?  And the source of the script?
As for the second problem.. this is almost certainly
an error message displayed by the FormMail script itself,
and not by Apache.  Since you're getting the message, the
script appears to be running normally - though not giving
the results you expect.  You should examine the script
to find out what it wants for a valid HTTP_REFERER value.

State-Changed-Why:
The server is activating the scripts correctly; the problem
is that they're not behaving as expected due to their internal
configuration, not the server's.  Than you for using Apache!
