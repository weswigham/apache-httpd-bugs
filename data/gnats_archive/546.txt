>Description:
Problem with ErrorDocument + proxy pb when referring to a local URL that uses
other local URL to handle the error.

I tried to use the <Location> directive to deny proxy access to a host(tioman):

<Location http://>
  order allow,deny
  allow from all
  deny from tioman.cha.sekurit.saint-gobain.fr
  ErrorDocument 403 /reject.html
</Location>

I created a reject.html  with the following contents:

<TITLE>Reject</TITLE>
<img src=devil.gif align=middle>
You don't have access to this server!


When I connect to www.netscape.com for example from tioman. 
I get the access denied page without the devil.gif and in my error_log there 
is an entry:

[Mon May  5 09:49:47 1997] access to proxy:http://www.netscape.com/devil.gif
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       
failed for tioman.cha.sekurit.saint-gobain.fr, reason:
Client denied by server configuration


The server used the address of the page I accessed (http://www.netscape.com)
and not the address of my proxy server (http://proxy) to build the URL of
the devil.gif file (http://proxy/devil.gif)

If I write <img src=http://proxy/devil.gif align=middle> the server looks for
the devil.gif at the right location and not at 
http://www.netscape.com/devil.gif!


Note:
If I use the hostname instead of the FQDN for the rejected host, It doesn't
get rejected! (Even if gethostbyname works).

State-Changed-When: Mon May  5 19:46:53 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
ErrorDocument is not currently supported by the proxy, and
PR #362 already asks for this after 1.2.0 release. <Files>
and <Directory> blocks can be used to deny access to a
proxy, though <Location> will not work. Documentation for
proxy module will be changed to make this clearer.

State-Changed-When: Tue May 27 01:10:27 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Docs changed to be clearer on access restriction. Error
message configuration is duplicate of PR#362.
PS: IP address problem fixed - see PR#614
