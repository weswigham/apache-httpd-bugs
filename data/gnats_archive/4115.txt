>Description:
Attempting to set up cgi-bin directories for each user, I followed the directions in the FAQ.  I put these directives into my httpd.conf:

----- Start httpd.conf excerpt -----
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/html/cgi-bin/

<Directory /usr/html/cgi-bin>
  Options +ExecCGI
  AllowOverride None
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>

UserDir public_html

<Directory /home/*/public_html>
    AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Options
    Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
    <Limit GET POST OPTIONS PROPFIND>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Limit>
    <Limit PUT DELETE PATCH PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
    </Limit>
</Directory>


AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

<Directory /home/*/public_html/cgi-bin>
  Options +ExecCGI
  AllowOverride None
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>

------ END httpd.conf excerpt -----

The server does execute the file from both the ~user/cgi-bin URL and /cgi-bin URL, but from ~user/cgi-bin it generates the error about "Premature end of script headers", while from /cgi-bin it works correctly.  This can be repeated with the test-cgi sh script, the printenv PERL script, and my own test TCL script.  I have turned off all output buffering via $| or fconfigure (respectively), and tested from the command line to confirm that
Content-Type: text/html

is in fact printed to stdout.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.mcramerica.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi
http://www.mcramerica.com/~kutulu/cgi-bin/test.cgi
http://www.mcramerica.com/kutulu/test.cgi 

This is test-cgi, shipped with Apache, renamed to test.cgi, and cp'd into the directories.  Both have permissions 0755.  The third URL also works, (see below), and is the same physical file (/home/kutulu/public_html/cgi-bin/test.cgi) as the second URL.
>Fix:
Currently, I can fix the problem by using ScriptAlias to define a cgi-bin alias for each user with cgi, as in:

ScriptAlias /kutulu/ /home/kutulu/public_html/cgi-bin/

Do you have suexec enabled?

Is anything printed about "suexec" in the error log when you start Apache?

If you do have suexec enabled, did you look in the suexec
cgi.log?

 Ack!  You're absolutely right.
 
 The web server is running as 'nobody' (the default from httpd.conf), but the
 suexec caller is set to 'www' (the default from suexec.h.  I just recompiled
 with --suexec-caller=nobody, now it works like a champ.  Sorry to bug you
 for something so simple :(
