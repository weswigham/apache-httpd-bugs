Intel boxes 
Linux 2.0.29/2.0.30/2.1.35 
gcc 2.7.2/2.7.2.1
>Description:
The Scoreboard file is not created in the specified directory under beta 8.
The http://machine/server-status output exists but is formatted differently
than under 1.2b7. 1.2b7 still works and creates the file.  Identical
compilation config files and runtime config files can be used for both
versions and 1.2b8 still doesn't create the file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with mod_status enabled, enable scoreboard in config files
>Fix:
Sorry, no help here, all I can do is complain ;%2

State-Changed-Why:
This is actually a Good Thing.  The scoreboard file is slow
and unreliable.  In 1.2b8 it was moved to shared memory on
linux.  But in 1.2b9 we will be changing that to require the
user to select a compile time option (LINUX_TWEAK).  If you
really want the status file you can remove #define HAVE_SHMGET
from the LINUX section in conf.h.  But for the most part
selecting /server-status?refresh=10 replaces the http_monitor
facility and is more reliable.
