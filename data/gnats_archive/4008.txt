Documentation
>Description:
The ErrorDocument documentation is missing information on having to 
set the Status: header in cgi scripts.

The apacheweek info at:
http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/96-05-17#underdev

would be very helpful in the real docs and also a mention of using Status: 302
to allow Location headers and redirect scripts for error documents.

Thanks,
