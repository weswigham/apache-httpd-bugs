>Description:
When enabling the mod_status and mod_info in the Configuration file they are not
compiled when doing a 'make'. Only when you add them with --activate-module=src/modules/standard/mod_status.c(mod_info.c)
they are compiled when doing the 'make'.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Maybe changing the 'configure' script, I don't know ;-)

State-Changed-Why:
If you are using the apaci interface, you should not be
editing Configuration directly.  It will not work.

If you want to edit Configuration directly, then use the
"normal" method and just run Configure.

Otherwise, use the configure command line options
(--enable-module, use --help for a full list).
