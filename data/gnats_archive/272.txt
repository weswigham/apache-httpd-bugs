>Description:
When posting Apache Bugs from one of the german apache mirrors, the submitted
bug reports never make it to the bug db. There is neither an EMail reply
(which I think would be the least feedback after a sentence like 
"...you'll be contacted in days, if not hours" as the form promises) nor does
a search in the bugdb show the submitted bug.
I posted one on apache.www.nacamar.de about a week or two ago (about https:
requests not working in a proxy chain), and a search in the bugdb only shows
a "https" match that was corrected in february. So where did my report go?!?!
>How-To-Repeat:
I hope you cannot, but I fear you will.
(http://apache.www.nacamar.de/bug_report.html) -- why don't they have the GNATS
frontend you have on www.apache.org?

Mirrors should get up-to-date version of apache-site tre

State-Changed-Why:
Should work fine.  You are supposed to be directed to the
bug reporting script on www.apache.org since it is 
impractical to have all the mirrors handle it.  I just
noticed one place (in the 1.2b6 patches directory) 
with an incorrect link, but all others should point to
www.apache.org explicitly.  

Please bring this up again with a specific example of a
link that goes to the incorrect place if there are still
any around.  Thanks.
