Hi,

When I try to launch httpd, I do not receive any error messages (but the failed kill),
a pid is written into conf/httpd.pid (which I supose means that the httpd process has been launched...)
but a ps gives no such process...

So I'd like to know if there are known problems with cc compiler ( I had warnings like :
cc: "util_md5.c", line 117: warning 604: Pointers are not assignment-compatible.
cc: "util_md5.c", line 117: warning 563: Argument #1 is not the correct type.
but I don't think it is very important... )

Can you tell me what are the processes that httpd launches and which may kill the main process ?
May user rights of conf files or executables provokes such errors (httpd user is nobody:nogroup, 
apache has been installed under root:other) ?

Thanks in advance for your answer,
Regards,
	Romain.
