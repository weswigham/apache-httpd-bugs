Digital Unix V3.2g. Compiled with Digital Unix standard cc compiler.
>Description:
I believe this is the same problem as reported in bug report 317. I can
specify Options None in the config file but I still get an index of the
directory.  No .htaccess files are used in the directory or any parent
directories.  I have combined all configuration files into one, but I
wouldn't think that this would make a difference.  I will be happy to
send it to you for review.
>How-To-Repeat:
Inside a <Directory> block, specify Options None, HUP the server, and
if the file specified with the DirectoryIndex directive is not in the
directory then you will get an index listing.
>Fix:
Nope, but I'm looking..

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry but I can't reproduce this.  Are you sure your browser
isn't returning something from cache?  Could you send
the config that causes it?

Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
User found access.conf and srm.conf contained the directives
enabling indicies... after disabling those two there's no problem.
