>Description:
I am trying to use suExec for running CGI programs on a server that
is secured using mod_ssl.  The problem that I am running into is that
suExec strips out all of the SSL related environment variables when it
cleans the environment space of the child process.  Since it strips out
the variables, I lose the ability to detect whether my CGI programs are
running through SSL.
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a secure virtual host with a cgi-bin that uses suexec.  Put a CGI program in
the cgi-bin directory that echos its environment variables.  The HTTPS environment
variable and all the SSL_* variables will not be listed.  If you take away the
suexec usage, all the SSL_ variables will be listed.
>Fix:
The following patch to suexec.c adds the HTTPS variable to the
"safe_env_lst" variable and adds a check in clean_env() to look for and
retain all the variables that start with "SSL_".
