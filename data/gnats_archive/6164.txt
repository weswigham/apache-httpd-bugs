>Description:
From CHANGES:

  *) mod_include now entity encodes output from "printenv" and "echo var"
     by default.  The encoding for "echo var" can be set to URL encoding
     or no encoding using the new "encoding" attribute to the echo tag.
     [Marc Slemko]

This is simply not acceptible.  We use echo var at times to dynamically inject
small pieces of HTML code.  We've done this for years, and works quite well.  This
new "feature" breaks this entirely, requiring every page that uses echo var to
be manually changed to include "encoding=none", which of course doesn't work
on older Apache versions at all, let alone across SSI implementations of other
servers.

There is no justification for this change.  At the very least, there should exist
an httpd.conf directive to change this default globally or per directory/location.

At this point, we can not use 1.3.12 without manually pulling this change out of
mod_include.c as this affects thousands of pages, some which span differing
web server venders.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:

The encoding options are a nice idea, implemented carelessly.  The following
recommendations are thus made:

1) Return the default encoding to "none".
2) Add an httpd.conf directive to change the default encoding, perhaps even
   offer a method to extend it, but again defaulting to "none".
3) In the future, think about compatiblity before blindly implementing the new
   wis-bang feature of the week.

Thank you.

State-Changed-Why:
Please understand what you are talking about before saying
there is "no justification for this change".  There is a great
deal of justification, and a great deal of consideration was given to this.
Please see http://www.apache.org/info/css-security/ for details.  While perhaps a way to change the default would be useful for those who think they have no such problems, the default must remain as it is.

 Create a document that says:
 
 	You are accessing <!--#echo var="DOCUMENT_URI" -->.
 
 Suppose you want to do this.  Stuff like this one of the most 
 significant uses, in general, of the "echo" directive.  With the
 way Apache used to be, there is _NO_ way you can do this and properly
 encode output to protect yourself.  
 
 Based on knowledge of the demographics of the user base in terms of what
 they use echo for, the majority of users use it in a way that requires
 this.  So, by default, a behaviour that covers the most users possible and
 where a user messing up results in an obvious problem is preferred.

 Please, before you go on your rant try to understand the situation.  All
 of those are completely different situations.
