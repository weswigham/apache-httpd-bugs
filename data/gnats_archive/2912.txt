>Description:
My web pages are located in two different machines (two serves), an IBM
Risc 6000 (AIX) and an IBM-PC compatible (Linux), both using Apache 1.2.5
and Perl 5.004.04.
The part of the site that is in the AIX system is free, and the part stored
in the IBM-PC is restricted, and I'm using the DBM user authentication to
restrict the access. I want to create my DBM file for authentication in
the IBM RISC 6000 machine and transfer it to the IBM-PC computer (because
my system of Control to add new users is in IBM RISC 6000), but this way
the authentication doesn't work.
Please, how can I solve this problem?

 First, as we clearly say we strongly recommend you upgrade to the current
 release of Apache.  We can't support all sorts of odd problems with old
 releases; we simply don't have the resources.

 What do you mean "doesn't work"?
 
 What dbm libraries are you using on the RS6000?
 
 What ones are you using on the Linux system?  This is almost certainly due
 to a difference in the libraries being used.

 Answers to your questions:
 
 -> What do you mean "doesn't work"?
    The server shows the window asking for an username and a password.
 I write the correct information, but the server returns an Internal
 Server Error (the same error happens when I don't have the DBM file 
 created).
 
 -> What DBM library are you using?
    I'm using the DBM library that comes with the operational system.
 The same procedure was made both in the aix system and in
 then linux system. The dbm files created have the extensions _.pag
 and _.dir
 
  To be more precise, I will describe the procedures that I made
  in the IBM RS 6000 (aix):
  - I compiled Perl with dbm library (DBM);
  - I executed dbmmanage to create dbm files;
  - I compiled apache to use dbm library;
  - to test, I made the dbm user authentication in this machine and
 it worked well;
  In the PC machine (linux), I executed the same steps described above. 
 
  As you can see, the problem happens when I create the dbm file in 
 the Risc 6000 and transfer it (ftp bin) to the IBM-PC. This way,
 neither the authentication function, nor the dbmmanage program can
 read the dbm file.
 
  I've also tried using GDBM library 1.7.3 (both in aix and linux system)
 but the problem persists.
