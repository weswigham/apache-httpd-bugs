>Environment:
Windows 95 , Visual C++ 6.0
>Description:
The provided makefile.nt targeted for building apache uses % signs around variables. It should really be using $() around variables so that they get properly substituted by nmake.exe.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Replace %LONG% and %SHORT% in makefile.nt with $(LONG) and $(SHORT)

State-Changed-Why:
This is really a difference between NT and Win9x. The 
makefile is designed for NT, which is why it is called
Makefile.nt. In 1.3.4 there are separate makefiles
for Win9x (one for a release build and one for a debug
build). This will let you build Apache on Win9x and
so solves this problem. Note that Apache is designed
to be built with VC++ 5, not 6, although I would expect
both to work.

 Hello,
 
     I noticed the new files in 1.3.4, but if you make this change to the
 makefile.nt, then you will support both NT and Win95/98 without having to
 maintain two sets of makefiles. I think this would be a cleaner fix to the
 problem.
 
 Thanks
 Juan

State-Changed-From-To: closed-feedback
State-Changed-By: pcs
State-Changed-When: Fri Feb  5 02:02:52 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Yes, it would be nicer to use a single makefile
for NT and Windows 95. However I am not sure how to
do it. We need to be able to select between a Debug
and Release build by target name, and you cannot
set Make macros within targets. How do you suggest
we use $(...) macros to make this change?

I've reopened this PR to the "feedback" state.

State-Changed-When: Fri Mar 19 06:10:33 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
While a single makefile is desireable, the submitter
has not responded with an explanation of how it can be
done. So I'm closing this PR again.
