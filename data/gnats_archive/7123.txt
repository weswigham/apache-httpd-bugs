>Description:
In order to get around having to use the Apache global timeout value for all timeouts, we would like to see the following calls (name them what you will) added to the next release of Apache. We don't believe these additions would in any way affect the current functionality of any part of the web server. It would need to be documented that ap_reset_timeout, if called, would still use the global timeout in all cases.

API_EXPORT(void) ap_flexible_hard_timeout(char *name, request_rec *r, int seconds)
{
    timeout_req = r;
    timeout_name = name;

    ap_set_callback_and_alarm(timeout, seconds);

}

API_EXPORT(void) ap_flexible_soft_timeout(char *name, request_rec *r, int seconds)
{
    timeout_name = name;

    ap_set_callback_and_alarm(timeout, seconds);

}

Thanks! (Obviously, the request_rec* argument is not needed in the second call, but we left it there for uniformity.)

Sorry, we aren't making that kind of change to 1.3 any more,
and 2.0 doesn't use timeouts in the same way.
Thanks for using Apache!
