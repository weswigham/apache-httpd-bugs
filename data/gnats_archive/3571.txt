Solaris 2.5.1
Server: Apache/1.3.3 (Unix) PHP/3.0.5
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
You can have a very simple but effective Denial of Service simply opening
several connections in parallel (telnet/NetCat). Each connection move a child
to "Reading" state, disabling it until the connection is closed or timeout
arrives.

You can launch easily 10 connects per second from a dialup connection,
eating all the Apache children. The service would be dead until timeouts
expire.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply open as many telnet connections as Apache children you had configured.
>Fix:
None correct, but possible temporal workaround):
* Limit simultaneous connections from a single IP.
* An unique dispatcher. When you have several request, serve first:
  * Older requests
  and
  * Request with the least concurrency (simultaneous requests)

State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately none of the things you suggested are feasible with
the current apache architecture.

If someone attacks your host this way, filter their IP address.
