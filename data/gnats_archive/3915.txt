>Release:        1.3.1
>Environment:
Solaris 5.6 (but not relevant for this suggestion)
>Description:
The suggested feature would parse all HTML files sent by Apache so that:
* links like <a href="mailto:adr@host.dom"> can be replaced by a simple call to JavaScript function
that does the same, with a document.write(..) 
* addresse like adr@host.dom can be automatically replaced by adr@<something useless>host.dom

With this feature, there won't be anymore mailto: "visible" or email addresses.
Most email grabbers will be fooled. Both javascript code AND dummy tags can be improved randomly so that
no grabbers will be able to locate the addresses.

This systems works with all browsers, even if browsers like LYNX will not show
the mailto: links (but email adresses will be visible, however)

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have written an example code, that works fine. It hides all email addresses, and
it is totally transparent to the browers. Email grabbers are unable to catch
ANY addresses.

I did not sent the code, because it is rather large (100k) [it's the patched main/http_core.c file]
If you are interested in it, I'll send it to you.

Xavier Roche

State-Changed-Why:

Thank you for the suggestion, but this isn't something we
want to put into the base server.  I strongly suspect that
it only applies to documents delivered by the default
content handler, so the output from mod_include, mod_cgi,
mod_proxy, and other modules that deliver content would not
be massaged by this.

You might consider reworking this as a module and submitting
it to the module registry; it would fit very nicely in front
of the default handler if done as a module.

 [Synopsis: Suggest code: automatically "hides" email addresses using javascript to avoid 
 spamming/email grabbers on Web sites]
 
 The patch is on the http_core.c file source, in the default_handler function. This is just a 
 call to a "void _nospam_patch_code(char* sbuff,int slen,char** _dbuff,int* _dlen)" routine, 
 that transforms all active email addresses (a href="mailto:..") into javascript code. If the 
 browser does not support javascript, the email address will appear, however the link won't be 
 active. (This is the limit of the system)
 
 Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to make a module, but I'll send the source to anyone 
 who will ask me to.
 
 Regards,
 Xavier Roche
