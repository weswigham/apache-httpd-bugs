Linux/PPC 2.2.x
glibc-2.1.1
egcs-1.1.2
>Description:
Apache 1.3.6 (haven't tested earlier versions) dumps core on Linux/PPC if handed 
a nonexistent URL. The problem is that ap_log_rerror() uses a va_list variable
twice without an intervening va_end/va_start combination. This invokes undefined
behaviour according to C9X.
I've checked the other uses of va_list in apache, but this was the only misuse
I found.

Franz.
