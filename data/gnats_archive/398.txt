SunOS 4.1.4 most major patches. GCC 2.7.2
>Description:
When attempting to retreive a user's CGI with arguments (i.e. with a
question and data appended) Apache (or suExec) appears to be
escaping the username. I am pretty sure this is an Apache problem,
I'm had suExec print the argument it receives on the command line
it is definately escaped - I'm still trying to see where Apache is
doing the escaping.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~mike/cgi-bin/wwwadmin.pl (works)
http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~mike/cgi-bin/wwwadmin.pl? (works)
http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~mike/cgi-bin/wwwadmin.pl?<anything> (fails)
>Fix:
I've been looking at util_script.c at the point where Apache is about
to handover execution to SUEXEC - but am having no luck. I'm not sure
if something else is kicking off SUEXEC though
