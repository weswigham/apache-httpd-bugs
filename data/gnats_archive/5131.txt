>Environment:
SPARC Solaris 2.6
>Description:
A "conf/save-install.sh" shell script call "install" command directly, but Solaris 2 has two "install" commands ("/usr/sbin/install" and "/usr/ucb/install") and "/usr/sbin/install" (System V) is called in default.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install on Solaris 2.
>Fix:
Use a "src/scripts/build/unix/install-sh" shell script instead of a "install" command.
