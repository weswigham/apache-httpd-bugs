 The permission fixed the password error I was getting.   But I have have
 the same setup for a different port number mapped to a different directory,
  it did not prompt for login, it just finish drawing the page.  The
 permission and owners are set to the identical setting as the one that has
 working password protection.  
 
 Thank you for your help,
