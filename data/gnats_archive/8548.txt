>Environment:
Using the MSI Installer on Windows 2000 SP2 + hotfixes
>Description:
The MSI Installer for Windows platforms goes through all the steps of installing, but after clicking the Install button it says it was interrupted.

This only happens to me when the .msi file is in a directory with a very short name, such as c:\z.  It does not exhibit this behavior when the .msi is in a longer path such as c:\software\devtools\apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a directory named c:\z, copy the .msi file into it, try installing Apache.  I also had uninstalled 1.3.20 prior to this, and am unsure if that is a variable.
>Fix:
Just what I described above as a work-around.  I'm not sure how to fix the MSI.
