>Description:
Having recently installed 1.3b3, we are now seeing error messages of the form
[Mon Dec 22 00:07:26 1997] [crit] (2)No such file or directory: mmap_handler: mm
ap failed: /home/staz/stazsoftware/prodall.html
for files that really *do* exist:
$ ls -al /home/staz/stazsoftware/prodall.html
-rw-rw-r--   1 tech     staz         3535 Dec  8 09:12 /home/staz/stazsoftware/prodall.html

Most client connections reference the "missing file" successfully:
firestone.alexa.com - - [22/Dec/1997:00:07:47 -0600] "GET /prodall.html HTTP/1.1" 200 3535

But the "critical" stamp in the error log is getting our attention.  If a mmap
fails, is the server reverting to conventional "I/O"?  Just how critical an
error is this, really?
