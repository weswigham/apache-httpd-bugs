>Description:
I am probably missing something in the configuration, but I can't find it.
I want to run Perl using REGULAR CGI not "mod_perl" nor "EmbedPerl"!!!
All of your doc for Perl point to or refer to "mod_perl", how do I use regular Perl??

Hardware: Win-Chip 200 (Pentium 200 equivalent)
HD: 8Gig
Memory: 125Mb
Network: Internal
OS: NT4.0 SP4
Also running SyGate from SyberGen, Inc - http://www.sygate.com/

Installed Apache
Installed Perl - This is perl, version 5.005_02 built for MSWin32-x86-object

Perl is set as the application for ".pl"

It runs the script from the command prompt properly.

Seems to work properly with HTML files in the htdocs directory.

Enabled the CGI (I think)

=========================================================================================================
From: "access.conf" file:
.....................
# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".
..................
# E:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/cgi-bin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.

<Directory "E:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/cgi-bin">
AllowOverride None
#Options None
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>
......................

From the "srm.conf" file:
.................
# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
# Format: ScriptAlias fakename realname

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "E:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/cgi-bin/"
............
# AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers",
# actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
# or added with the Action command (see below)
# Format: AddHandler action-name ext1

# To use CGI scripts:
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
................
=========================================================================================================
Do I have to enable anything else? What am I missing??


When attempting to access the CGI I get:
=========================================================================================================
Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
Please contact the server administrator, jraff@injersey.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

couldn't spawn child process: e:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/envdmp.pl

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache/1.3.3 Server at win-chip-2-a Port 80
=========================================================================================================

No I do NOT want to run Mod_Perl!!!
I need to build applications for other sites and I do not need "mod_perl" idosyncricies getting in the way.

Provide better "regular" CGI configuration documentation WITH OUT all the

 Are you sending the correct HTTP headers in your cgi?
 try
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
 print "<h1>Hello</h1>";
 
 And if that works then, the setup is correct adn your CGI is wrong.

State-Changed-Why:
Lots of CGI updates since this report. They work. Sounds like you needed to frob the shebang line in the perl script to point to the perl interpreter.
