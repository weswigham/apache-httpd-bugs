>Release:        1.3.20-cygwin
>Organization:
>Environment:
Cygwin 1.1.8 (0.34/3/2) 2001-01-31 10:08 i686 unknown
>Description:
It seems as if on Cygwin the SIGUSR1 signal which is called within main/http_main.c:perform_idle_server_maintenance() when idle_count > ap_daemons_max_free has _no_ effect on the child. Apache tries to kill that 
specific (last) child within the scoreboard forever and therefore if certain load peaks are served no childs are killed and memory gets exhausted.
>How-To-Repeat:
At least noticed on WinNT4sp6. I don't know if Cygwin 1.3.x is having the same problem with signals. Maybe Win2k may be acting different too, but shouldn't be.

1) start httpd
2) ab -c 50 -n 1000 http://localhost/
3) see that last pid isn't killable using SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP (even SIGTERM)
4) repeat 2-3) and you'll see there are more and more httpd process childs
5) memory gets exhausted some time
>Fix:
On Cygwin platforms SIGKILL has to be used for reaping the last child and reach the MaxSpareServer limit.

A patch will be posted to new-httpd@apache.org

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: martin
State-Changed-When: Tue Jun 12 01:46:46 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Your (rather brute) patch has been applied. However, using
SIGKILL is not a very "graceful" way to terminate a child.
As soon as you know a better fix, we should integrate that
in place of the SIGKILL.
