State-Changed-Why:
As the comment at the top says, that file is automatically
created.  I have no idea what your line 8 is.

Exactly how are you configuring php and exactly what is wrong in
the file that is generated?

Does this happen if you don't use php?

 The line 8 is where I think the #endif is needed:
 /*
  *  ap_config_auto.h -- Automatically determined configuration stuff
  *  THIS FILE WAS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT!
  */
 
 #ifndef AP_CONFIG_AUTO_H
 #define AP_CONFIG_AUTO_H
 
 /* check: #include <dlfcn.h> */
 #ifndef HAVE_DLFCN_H
 #define HAVE_DLFCN_H 1
 #endif

 I have php and apache untared at the same level directory, and as the INSTALL file says I do:
 
 cd ../php-3.0.5
 ./configure --with-apache=../apache_1.3.3
 make
 
 and the error appears.
 
 I EDIT MANUALLY the file and compilation goes OK

 I wont php for teaching my students, and perhaps I have PHP now (compiled but not tested).
 Thanks

 You mean here?  Nope, like almost every other Apache header file that is
 terminated at the end.
 
 Please include the entire file, as generated without changes.

 What error?  You haven't told me exactly what error you are getting.

 If it only happens when you include php in the compile, then php could be
 doing something wrong causing the problem.
