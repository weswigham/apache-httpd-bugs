>Description:
If request header fields (et alia) are used in mod_rewrite rules,
the response header field Vary should be updated accordingly.
Currently mod_rewrite never updates the Vary header field at all.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Recognize the use of HTTP_* in the LHS of rewrite rules, or triggering
conditions, and update the Vary header field appropriately.  Doing
it more completely for the other conditions (besides input header field
values) that can trigger rewriting will probably require a lot of study.

 Actually I think this should still be under the control of the user -- and
 there should be a flag for the rhs that says "set a Vary header for this". 
 No, scratch that, do it in the negative sense so that users have to rtfm
 to get rid of the Vary.  So like this: 
 
 RewriteCond %{HTTP_FOOBAR} regex [NV=foobar]
 
 Would mean no Vary on Foobar necessary.  But without the NV it would
 automatically vary on foobar.
 
 Then there's only a few dozen other places where we need to do vary
 automatically... mod_include and mod_setenvif/mod_browser come to mind
 immediately.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem now is suspended until of Apache 1.3.0 because a timely
solution is not possible or not cost-effective at the present time. For a
later release we'll reconsider this report again.

Comment-Added:

mod_rewrite has been updated to correctly set Vary in
cases which do not result in a redirect.  There is more
work to be done here, so I am not closing this report.
This particular change should appear in the next release
after 1.3.1 (just announced).
