FreeBSD 2.1
>Description:
I am attempting to use Apache as a proxy server on our Firewall.  Unfortunately,
it looks like I would have to specify each file that needs to be accessed in
the configuration.  I have tried wildcards and they do not appear to work.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Allow a wildcard entry for the proxies, e.g., 
ProxyPass /* http://www.stryder.com/

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 24 21:04:32 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
You don't need a ProxyPass command to use it as a simple
proxy, but if your application needs one just use 
'ProxyPass / http://www.stryder.com/' should work fine.
