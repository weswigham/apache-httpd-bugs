>Organization:
>Environment:
I have tested on Win2k SP2 and WinNT SP6a. I used the pre-compiled binaries downloaded from Apache.org. Version was 1.3.22 Win32.
>Description:
When a program in the cgi-bin is called, the command line used is mangled. That is, instead of a full name it uses the ~# system of DOS 8.3. This exists in Apache 1.3.20/22 Win32. It does not exist in Apache 2.0.28. I have not tested personally but another in my group found that Apache 1.3.14 did not have this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, don't have any externally available URL's. But I would be willing to help out with debugging resources.
>Fix:
Look at the code for 2.0.28 or 1.3.14 and compare it with 1.3.22 for how it develops the command line call.

State-Changed-Why:
This behavior is by design.

To get the true path, with spaces, you must use the
shebang syntax;

#!path/to/prog "%1"

which will quote the filename, and assure it is a full name.
