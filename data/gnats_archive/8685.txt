>Description:
I have compiled httpd-2.0.16, downloaded directly from apache.org main space.
I've compiled it with DEFAULT options:
./configure
make
make install
/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
Apache starts, makes couple of zombies, whose later die, puts these lines into the logfile:

And repeating these messages.
When i telnet to port 80 and say:
HEAD / HTTP/1.0\n\n

server waits a little while (10secs?) and dies. 
Log says nothing more, but my grsec patch reports about some bad eleven signals:
grsec: max process limit reached with (httpd:12145) by UID (65534), EUID (65534), parent (httpd:12142), UID (0), EUID (0)
grsec: more max proc limits reached, logging disabled for 30 seconds
grsec: signal 11  sent to (httpd:12142), UID (0), EUID (0), parent (init:1), UID (0), EUID (0)
grsec: more signal warnings, logging disabled for 30 seconds

>How-To-Repeat:
I can offer you access to my machine to test it.
>Fix:
no way...
