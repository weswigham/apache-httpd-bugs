Just compile apache 1.2.3 with proxy on. Use a client to using apache 1.2.3
as proxy server to access home.netscape.com, www.yahoo.com... things weird.
No problem with my existing setup, apache 1.2.0. I immediately revert back to
1.2.0.

No clue for myself... :-(

Proxy used to work quite fine in 1.2.0 version, not on 1.2.3..
