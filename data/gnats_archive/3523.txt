Hi:

Error found !!!

I found the following line in the main error server file:

	[Thu Dec 10 00:14:22 1998] [notice] httpd: child pid 1076 exit signal
Filesize limit exceeded (25)

So, the problem was nevertheless a limitation of either the amount of
memoryuse or memorylocked .

I made that restriction less strict and it runs very well.

Many thanks for your help
