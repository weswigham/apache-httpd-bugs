NT 4.0 Intel with service pack 3, Apache 1.3b2, precompiled
>Description:
Can apache call files with spaces in the filenames? I tried many times, but to
no avail. Is this fixed in 1.3b3? Is it planned to be fixed? Thanks.

eg.
transfer file named My File.Ext

Apache only responds with a 404.

Help?!?!

Then try to download a file with a space in it.
>Fix:
Have Apache support filenames with spaces

State-Changed-When: Sun Dec  7 20:20:13 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
URLs can not have spaces in them, and even if Apache did
try to let them it would be unable to guess correctly
all the time.

Any spaces are supposed to be encoded as %20 as per the
standard.  If you do that, it works fine.
