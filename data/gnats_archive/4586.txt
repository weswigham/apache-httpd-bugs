Problem category: mod_autoindex and documentation
IndexIgnore README*
IndexIgnore ~
IndexIgnore *~

It's not clear how Apache really matches filenames and how the four types of
tokens that may appear on the IndexOptions line are recognized.

E.g., in a previous release, IndexIgnore ~ was enough to ignore all Emacs backup
files (and more), supposedly due to the partial filename match.

Does IndexIgnore .tmp mean an extension or a full filename?
>How-To-Repeat:
IndexIgnore README*
files in some directory
_README
README.Amiga at http://fit.gmd.de/~hoehle/amiga-clisp/
1. _README shouldn't show (partial match?), but does.
2. README.Amiga is unfortunately hidden by top-level option in srm.conf which
 cannot be undone in local directories through some .htaccess.
>Fix:
1. Define "file extension, partial filename, wildcard expr. or full filename"
2. Define how Apaches disinguishes one from another on the IndexIgnore line
3. src.conf.default IndexIgnore should use README README.html HEADER HEADER.html
 instead of the unfortunate README* HEADER*
4. I'd at least drop partial matches, since they can easily hide too much and
 that cannot be undone (see toplevel README* damage), requiring "*partial" syntax
 instead (as in *~ vs ~).
