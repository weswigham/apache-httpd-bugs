NB 1.2.4 [which came with the dist] runs fine, and the 1.3b3 source compiled fine 
on intel & sparc linux systems.  
There are two variables here - system type - alpha vs. intel/sparc, and OS 
version - RH 5 [glibc] vs. RH 4.2
I've tried the fix suggested in #806 [The error is beause, for some reason, your system doesn't
support shared memory.  Remove the HAVE_SHMGET line from
the LINUX section of conf.h and try recompiling.] with no success.

Compile on a vanilla RH 5.0 alpha dist.  I'd be happy to provide accounts.

 I'd say wait for 1.3b4, I made a few changes in this area... and you
 should probably upgrade to glibc 2.0.6.  I've actually been able to get it
 to compile and run on an alpha redhat 5.0 system without any extra tweaks.
 But the system wasn't put together by me so it's possible the owner
 already made some suggested tweak. 
 
 If you're brave you can edit the src/main/conf.h file, find the LINUX
 section and hardcode the NET_SIZE_T define to socklen_t instead of size_t.
 See if that works.
 
 Actually your best bet is probably to ask in one of the redhat newsgroups
 for help.  We'll certainly want to support it by the time we do 1.3
 release, but right now redhat 5.0 and glibc are in a bit too new and not
 done moving yet.

 Dean -
 
 thanks for the lightning response!  I altered conf.h [fixed the
 http_main.c item per the above], and altered http_config.c line 878 to:
  int offset =3D (int) (long) cmd->info;
                              ^^  added
 
 This eliminates the warning messages, and seems to get things a bit
 further along, as now when I attempt to start httpd I get the following
 message in error_log:
 [crit] (45)Operation not supported: setsockopt: (SO_REUSEADDR)
 
 I'll post a message at axp-list.redhat.com as well.
 
 thanks again

 That looks like you've already got a server running on that socket under a
 different user id.
 
 1.3b4 already contains a change like the one I suggested... so I'm gonna
 close this one out.  But feel free to reply to it and tell us if you find
 out any more.

 Er wait no, I'm wrong in what I just said.  This looks like a kernel or
 libc problem.  It shouldn't refuse this, it does implement SO_REUSEADDR.
 
 Oh hmm!  I wonder if it's got a problem with the sizeof(int) parameter.
 But the Single Unix spec says it's supposed to take an int there, so it
 should be ok.  Dunno, tell me what you find out from axp-list... leaving
 this open.
 
 Thanks

 axp-list produced nothing of use.  In the mean time, I grabbed a 'spare'
 intel box and loaded RH 5.0 on it.  apache compiled and runs without a
 murmur.  So, I think it's pretty certain that this is an alpha specific
 bug, I suspect something to do with the glibc transition, but I don't have
 a spare alpha to load a prior RH version on to test compile.
 
 If the blinding light of understanding suddenly comes on, I'll forward
 details.

Any luck yet getting apache 1.3bX to compile on alpha redhat 5.0?

 Dean -
 
 Just an update on 1.3b5 : this version compiles with no perceptible
 errors, but when I attempt to run it error_log gets the following:
 
  [crit] (45)Operation not supported: setsockopt: (SO_REUSEADDR)
 
 Guess there continues to be a disparity on alpha, as this compiles and
 runs fine on intel [Red Hat 4.2 and 5.0] and Sparc [Red Hat 4.2].  If you
 think it is a kernel problem, I'll see if I can find someone running one
 of the 2.1.x kernels on alpha and have them give it a shot.
 
 cheers

 Ah, alpha!  This one is already in the problem database, no resolution
 yet.  I've doublechecked what apache is doing there against the single
 unix spec and apache is right, so glibc is what I'd blame.  glibc does
 massage some parameters before calling the kernel, so it may or may not be
 the kernel.
 
 Unfortunately I can't reproduce the problem on the alpha I have access to
 -- which claims to have glibc-2.0.6-9 and a 2.0.32 kernel installed.

Dean -

Just an update - the latest beta seems to build fine on my linux alpha
[Red Hat 2.0.30], but when I attempt to start the server I get the
following in error_log:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Wed Apr 22 17:00:25 1998] [crit] (45)Operation not supported: make_sock:
for po
rt 80, setsockopt: (SO_REUSEADDR)
[Wed Apr 22 17:00:25 1998] [error] (9)Bad file descriptor: accept: (client
socke
t)
<snip lots of previous message>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

As before, the problem seems to revolve around (SO_REUSEADDR).   If access
to an alpha running linux would help I'd be real willing to setup an
account for someone @ apache to test with.


TIA

Is this still an issue?  Since it doesn't appear to be
an Apache problem per se, it probably doesn't matter
what version you're running -- but you might want to
upgrade to 1.3.1 on general principles.
