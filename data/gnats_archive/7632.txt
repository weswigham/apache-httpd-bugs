>Description:
unable to use the --prefix directive with the GNU layout directive.....I edited the file config.layout and in the GNU area, the prefix was edited to what I desired.

Problem is that on the install.....files are placed in

    $prefix/X/apache/file

instead of

    $prefix/X/file

For example, the httpd.conf.defaults file was located in $prefix/etc/apache/httpd.conf INSTEAD of $prefix/etc/httpd.conf

State-Changed-When: Mon Sep  3 09:46:56 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This is the same behavior as Apache 1.3 displayed.  I
checked the history of Apache 1.3, and it has been this
way since the second version of config.layout, which was
released with Apache 1.3.4. 

This also follows the GNU rules, which allow for this 
subdirectory if a lot of files are installed.  From
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_54.html#SEC54 :

" If your program installs a large number of files into one of the standard user-specified directories, it might be useful to group them into a subdirectory particular to that program. If you do this, you should write the install rule to create these subdirectories. "

For these reasons, I am closing this bug report without
modifying the install directories.

Thank you for using Apache.
