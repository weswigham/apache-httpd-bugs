Linux 1.99.4
Compiler: gcc
>Description:
The client (Netscape Nav 3.0 Gold ge) initiate a file transfer from a FTP-Site
via Apache-Proxy. After receiving the first 4-5 kB the transfer was aborted by
user. Apache seems to get the file anyway (increasing du of proxy-dir, no other
traffic at this time).
After completing the transfer (proxy), the client initiate the transfer again,
but only gets a corrupted file (130kB of 2900kB) from proxy.
Another try: Apache gets the file completely, but after receiving it the cache-
size reduces by the size of the file. The next try from client arranges Apache
to reget the file from the remote host.
