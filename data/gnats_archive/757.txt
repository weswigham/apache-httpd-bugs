I seem to having the same problem as PR#741 

With what I believe to be the exact same settings as for 1.2.b10,
httpd fails to use/find suexec. No entries result in the cgi.log file.
I recompiled httpd version 1.2.b10 and suexec works fine......

As a result I get a whole bunch of the following
Warning: User directive in <VirtualHost> requires SUEXEC wrapper.
Warning: Group directive in <VirtualHost> requires SUEXEC wrapper.

State-Changed-Why:
I noticed no change in suexec functionality when going
from 1.2b10 to 1.2b11/final.  There was nothing changed in
1.2b11 which should have affected suexec.  One thing that
always trips me up is that I need to #define SUEXEC_BIN, i.e
by putting

EXTRA_CFLAGS= -DSUEXEC_BIN="\"/usr/local/www.tools/bin/suexec\""

in the Configuration file.

Let us know if that doesn't work.
