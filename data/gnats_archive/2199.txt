SUn O.S. 5.6(Ultra II), gcc 2.8.0
>Description:
Based on INSTALL instruction, I do not have to fix the permission or whatever
before trying PREFIX/sbin/apachectl start to test the new webserver.
But I got two obstacles...
One: They ask me to manually set the ServerName on my httpd.conf...
Two: fopen Permission denied error... couldnot open error_logs /usr/local/apache..

I have installed the webserver as root user BTW.

State-Changed-Why:
I don't think I understand what aspects of the documentation
you feel are deficient.  You *do* need to set your server's
ServerName directive.  Running the server as root is a
very very very bad idea.  You must be running with
superuser authority in order to use apachectl to start
and stop the server; a permission problem would seem
to indicate that you're not root when you tried to start
the server.
