Hello, 
Your server is great! But do you plan to support resuming when a download engine like GetRight
downloads files from the web? Netscape, GoZilla also can handle resuming 
downloads.

Apache already supports Byte-Range requests.

 When I try to download this file
 http://www.apache.org/dist/apache_1.2.6.tar.gz  GetRight
 says - "This server does not support resuming."
 
 When I try to download it from the ftp
 ftp://ftp.apache.org/apache/dist/apache_1_3b6_1.exe
 everything is ok. I can't explayn exactly where is the problem, but M$'s
 IIS supports resuming
 when download, Sambar server also supports resuming...

State-Changed-Why:
You need to talk to the author of your software about why
it doesn't support resuming downloads from Apache.
Apache handles it just fine and follows all relevant standards.

This is probably related to PR#1464, which talks about the
somewhat bogus method used by GetRight to figure out if
the server supports resuming downloads.
