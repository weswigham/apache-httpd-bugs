>Description:
It seems that in 1.3 you need to quote your AuthName strings (according to the
upgrading to 1.3 document).  It would be nice if this info was stated in the
documentation for the AuthName directive.  I looked there first, before looking
at (or finding for that matter) the upgrade document.

thanks.

 Hi.
 Thanks for your bug report to apache. As you mention in your
 message, the upgrading to 1.3 document is not clear enough:
 quotes are required only when the authentication realm contains
 whitespace. A clarification will be included in the
 documentation.
 Thanks again and regards.
