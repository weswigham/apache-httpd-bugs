>Description:
if one uses the ErrorDocument directive, the file that the directive specifies 
must be absolute directories (relative ones don't work). For example, if I call
an image, <img src="test.gif"> that image wouldn't appear if the url that called 
the error document wasn't in the same directory. I would need to specify,
<img src"/path/to/test.gif">, for this to work correctly. The server is using 
the url that has been accessed and only the HTML page that is being outputted.
If a path is included in the ErrorDocument than that path should be included in
the execution.

So...
 ErrorDocument 404 /path/to/notfound.html
 when accessing url, http://www.here.org/random/directory/file.html. Since 
 file.html doesn't exist, notfound.html is shown since this causes a 404 file 
 not found error. However, this is called with: 
   http://www.here.org/random/directory/notfound.html
 when it SHOULD be called with:
   http://www.here.org/path/to/notfound.html
 since the /path/to, was included in the ErrorDocument. 

The current functionality only be utilitized if no path is specified:
 ErrorDocument 404 notfound.html
Since I could see a time when multiple errordocument error messages would be
used (authentication failure for example). However, if an ErrorDocument is 
called with a path, that path should be used in the viewing.

State-Changed-Why:
That is the way things are supposed to work and have to work.
If you want Apache to send a redirect, then use a full path
including servername (ie. http://server/foo.html).  Otherwise,
Apache will just display the document instead of the default
error message.  There is no way for Apache to tell the client
to magically think it is in some other directory, so you have
to create your ErrorDocument documents with that in mind.
