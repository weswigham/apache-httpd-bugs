>Description:

I run a RedHat linux environment.  I have been distributing a mod_auth_gdbm (a slightly
patched mod_auth_dbm) in order to have a DBM method easily compiled on
RedHat linux that is compatable with the DBM method use by mod_php3.  While I can play
with include files for mod_auth_ndbm, the safest way is to  have a separate module.

  I can send the sources as a file attach, but the changes are trivial.  Is this
something that could be included in future releases for those who have gdbm on their systems?
