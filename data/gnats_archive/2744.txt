State-Changed-Why:
Your C compiler is either not installed properly or is
broken.  Please update your compiler, and be certain that
the compiler is designed for your exact OS version.

/usr/include/signal.h is supposed to include /usr/include/sys/signal.h
which is supposed to define struct sigaction.
