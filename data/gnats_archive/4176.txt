>Environment:
NT4.0, Java 1.1.6
>Description:
When trying to start Apache 1.3.6 (after installing ApacheJServer) with:
P:\apache\Apache.exe -d p:\Apache -s
I get:
P:\apache\Apache.exe: module ".\mod_jserv.c" is not compatible with this version
 of Apache.
Please contact the vendor for the correct version.
>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
I checked the "supported systems" item in the JServ documentation and noticed,
that apache_1_3_6 wasn't listed there. Should I go back to apache_1_3_4 or is
there any workaround?

State-Changed-Why:
You are trying to use a jserv compiled for 1.3.4 on 1.3.6.

That doesn't work.  You need a version of jserv compiled
for 1.3.6.

 You can get the .dll replacement at:
 
 <http://java.apache.org/jserv/dist/dll/>
 
 make sure to download it as binary.
