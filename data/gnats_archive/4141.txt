>Description:
Upon issuing the 'apachectl restart' command it was found that the java JServ part of
mod_jserv was not being restarted correctly. The following output is generated in the 
jserv_log file.

JServ process is started on the next 'apachectl restart' command
The restart command is issued on a daily basis as part of the access log processing
script.
>How-To-Repeat:
Alternate 'apachectl restart' commands
>Fix:
Operate the JServ process in manual mode so that it is not restarted when the 
'apachectl restart' is issued.
