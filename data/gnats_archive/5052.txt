HP-UX 11.00 A 9000/735, full ANSI C compiler,
(running on a _32_-bit machine)
>Description:
I am trying to compile Apache 1.3.9 under HP-UX 11 on a 32-bit machine.

This fails because configure seems to assume dlopen() et al present
if compiling for HP-UX 11. But his assumption is only true
for real 64-bit architectures. However, I have HP-UX 11 running on
a _32_ bit machine where only shl_load() et al are available.

Setting -DHPUX additionally yields

cc: "../../include/ap_config.h", line 236: error 1584: Inconsistent type declaration: "rlim_t".
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache with DSO-support on a 32-bit machine under HP-UX 11 :-)
>Fix:
Change configuration process - do no longer assume dlopen() available
if running under HP-UX11 bit also check for 64-bit arch.
Change all #ifdefs depending on HPUX* accordingly.
