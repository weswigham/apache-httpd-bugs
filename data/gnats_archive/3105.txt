When the following (escaped) is put in a .htaccess file with the whitespace between group and members being a tab.
require group	members
and sombody tries to access a document in its scope giving its correct credentials, the server will give an error like this:
[Wed Sep 30 10:43:24 1998] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] access to /secured/ failed, reason: user edwin not allowed access
when the tab is replaced with space(s) like this:
require group  members
it works fine.

 The module was using ap_getword with a space for a stop character,
 preventing it from parsing arguments to the require directive separated by
 tabs.  The following patch seems to fix the problem by calling
 ap_getword_white, which uses isspace().
