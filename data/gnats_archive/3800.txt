>Environment:
Windows 98 out of the [OEM] box.  Uname is not a win98 command.
Apache version _pache_1_3_4_win32 dated 10Jan99 from your distribution site
>Description:

I installed Apache version 1.3.4 on a clean Win 98 system -- i.e. no other version of Apache or any other web server was previously installed.

I took all the install defaults [program directory; 'typical' install; and icon location etc]

I restarted my system of course. 

When attempting to start from the start -> Programs -> Apache icon link, a DOS window flashes up and then exits.  A message may come and go, but... ?

When starting from an open DOS window with the command "apache -s" I get "bad command or filename"

*my* humble guess is that the install is not completing properly, and that maybe previous tests have been *over* a prior copy so things like conf files and registry entries have been previously properly set up, and they're not being done from scratch as it were?

This may also have led to the rather "untidy" problem 3258 reported earlier?
>How-To-Repeat:

take one Win 98 clean system; add one 1.3.4 win32.exe; run default install
>Fix:

Not me guv, sorry.

State-Changed-Why:
While I am not directly aware of anyone confirming Apache
installs on Win98, you should not get this problem. I
suspect if this was common more people would have reported
it.

The installer certainly works on a fresh system, and
includes content for the "modules" and "conf" directory.
The later comes from a program run after installation, but
the former is installed by the installer itself, and
it would be very unusual for it not to be installed (unless
you unselect "Additional Modules" in the custom install).

Are you sure you were not out of disk space, or did
not have permission to write to the install directory?
What actually *is* in the installed directory tree?

Did the installer give any error messages? Did it get
to the end and offer to display the README file? Have
you tried removing the install directory and installing
Apache again?

Note you should not reboot after installing (or 
deinstalling) Apache. Nowhere in the install or
documentation does it tell you to reboot (I guess it
won't do any harm, but only stupid application software
should require an OS reboot so Apache doesn't).

To run Apache manually, you need to give it the full
pathname. For example, C:\Apache\apache -d C:\Apache.

To check the registry, look in 
\HKLM\SOFTWARE\Apache Group\Apache\1.3.4.

 Thanks for prompt reply.
 
 In response --
 
 1.. No, i did a 'typical install', not a 'custom install' and thus I did not
 exclude any 'modules'
 
 2.. This is a new machine --there is still 5.5 gig of disk space free -- as
 is windoze wont, it's all a C drive, but no matter
 
 3..  I have whatever permissions are set up for a default owner of a brand
 new machine
 
 4..  Installed directory -- is as defaulted by your installation wizard
  \ -> program files -> apache group -> apache -> 'whatever'
 
 5..  No error message was given.  Yes, it offered to [and did] display the
 'readme'.  Why should I re-install if no error is indicated -- what would
 that be expected to achieve?
 
 6..  Maybe the "stupid application" was Adobe Reader which I also downloaded
 at the same time then?  It runs fine, and has its registry entries set up OK
 apparently
 
 7.. Running in a DOS window from the full path C:\Program... etc etc  gives
 the error message "could not open document config file ...
 [..path...]httpd.conf.
 
 >>> I GUESS THAT MIGHT BE THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM ?? <<<
 
 7(a)..  but why does the start icon not contain those path parameters??
 
 8..  There are no registry entries for Apache, except for the download
 directory I have saved it in [HKLM isn't there at all, so I did a 'find' on
 Apache..  Is HKLM maybe an NT thing?]
 
 9..  Before anyone asks, the LOG file is empty.
 
 10..  I note there are a number of other comments and queries in the bug DB
 about Win installs failing -- just maybe there's some real problem lurking??
 And BTW -- I'm an Apache fan -- in another life I was responsible for
 starting a very successful site ( www.itv-f1.com ) running on SGI and
 Apache, so I just would like to get my Win98 site running as well !
 
 Onwards...
 
 Scott

 OK it's fine now.  I did a 'remove programs' on the original install and
 re-installed the download.  Worked a treat !  Reg entry, conf files etc all
 present.
 
 Looks like maybe a tangle over the pending restart required by Acrobat may
 have precluded proper updating of the registry or whatever.  May well be a
 Win98 glitch.
 
 Memo to myself --  one thing at a time, huh?
 
 Memo to others -- "it is recommended that you do not attempt to install
 Apache whilst a system restart is pending -- for example from the
 installation of other software components"
 
 Sorry to have troubled you.
 
 Thanks, SP
