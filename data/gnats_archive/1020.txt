State-Changed-Why:
This database is for PRs about bugs in the Apache server.
Your report is not a bug in the Apache server.  You
really have to ask your admin.

 All of the contributers to Apache are all volunteers.  We don't have the
 manpower to help all the half a million users of Apache configure their
 server.  If you can put together a detailed description of your problem,
 you could try posting in comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.
