>Description:
The documentation for UseCanonicalName states that when it is enabled,
"The CGI variables SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT will be constructed from
the client supplied values as well. "  This is not true--SERVER_PORT
disregards the client-supplied host as noted in http_core.c.

That said, another directive controlling whether to use the supplied
port would be very helpful.  Sometimes, I need to access apache through
a TCP tunnel (the userspace kind) and need to know what port the client is using.
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A
>Fix:
Clean up all the mentions of port in the UseCanonicalName directive
documentation and emphasize that the port is the one on which the
connection arrived.
Add a new directive to toggle which port is reported.
