SunOS sif.ttsg.com 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/2.8.1/specs
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
2 machines.  DNS used for "load balancing".  When invoking CGI's with
mod_rewrite it would drop information.  Was suggested to be changed from
[R,L] to [P]

Doing so causes:
[Fri Apr 16 12:09:44 1999] [warn] [client 207.99.6.160] handler "cgi-wrapper" not found for: proxy:http://aserver.karupspc.com/lcgi-bin/wwwjoin/signup.cgi

The first message appears on EVERY cgi invocation.  I previously put in a report 
about it but never heard back.

 	I'm still unable to get this to work.  Is there any estimate about
 getting this fixed?

 Hi,
 
 	This has been open for over 2 months. I really find it abhorent
 that it hasn't received an answer or been closed with "SCREW OFF". I
 realize its a public domain program, but the least you can do is
 acknowledge it exists and say that the functionality is broken and 
 remove it.  I'm VERY disappointed that neither the author of mod_proxy
 or mod_rewrite even have said "Hey, it don't work, get over it".
