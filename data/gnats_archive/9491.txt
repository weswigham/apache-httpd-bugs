>Description:
1 of my box run apache 2.0.28-beta and FYI, the box host 1 of hit website (nearly 1000 hit per day). the httpd always stop responding like 20 times a day. Even httpd still shown up in pid process but user can't even browse the webs. When i try to kill the process (i did it by killall httpd), Seems httpd never response to the kill command, the process still in pid even 100 times i kill it. This never happened in httpd 2.0.16-beta(I use that version previously). When the httpd stop response, this message shown up in apache error log.

-[Wed Jan 16 13:40:42 2002] [warn] new file descriptor 3370 is too large; you probably need to rebuild Apache with a larger FD_SETSIZE (currently 1024)

i don't think increase number off FD_SETSIZE is the solution. Another version 1.3.20 and 1.3.22 never having such CRITICAL problem even without increase those file descriptor size. Hope you guys fix this bugs. Mail me sometimes.

Comment-Added:
There are a many improvements that have been made in
subsequent versions (we are up to 2.0.32 now) that are
available at
  http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/
 
Please see if that clears up your leakage.

State-Changed-Why:

Without more specifics, this report isn't much help.  There are
tremendous improvements in 2.0.32, and many more in the coming
release 2.0.34.  Please try those and explore the current
version's stability, I believe you will be much happier with it.
