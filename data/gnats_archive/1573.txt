>How-To-Repeat:
Basically the problem occured in an company-internal network when
accessing a https URL through another proxy, which in turn talks to
the Internet. That is, during processing of a CONNECT request.

The httpd.conf setting was this:

ProxyRequests On
ProxyRemote * http://www-proxy.plumcake.com
NoProxy .plumcake.com .plumcake.com:8080 172.16.0.0/16
ProxyDomain .plumcake.com

www-proxy.plumcake.com is the internet firewall. Internally the same DNS
domain is used as externally (plumcake.com). For all internal requests
our Apache proxy should talk directly to the hosts. We use address space
172.16.0.0/16 internally.

Besides, the :8080 syntax above does not work as of 1.3b3 but causes
a debugging message: "@@@@ handle optional port in proxy_is_domainname()".
>Fix:
Some little debugging turned out that `host' was a NULL pointer in
proxy_match_ipaddr(). It looks like a test for NULL was missing.
This test is present in the other three proxy_match methods (_domainname,
_hostname, _word). Here's a quick patch which fixed the problem:

--- proxy_util.c        Thu Dec 18 17:15:54 1997

*** 983,988 ****
--- 983,991 ----
      const char *found;
      const char *host = proxy_get_host_of_request(r);
  
+     if (host == NULL)         /* some error was logged already */
+       return 0;
+ 
      memset(&addr, '\0', sizeof addr);
      memset(ip_addr, '\0', sizeof ip_addr);

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you very much for the report - an earlier bug
report (#1326) also had a patch for this and another
related hole, and that patch has been committed against the
1.3 code base.  If you could try pulling down a CVS snapshot
in a couple of hours from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/
as a final verification, it would be appreciated.  Thanks, 
and thanks for using Apache!
