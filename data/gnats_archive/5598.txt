SunOS apple 5.7 Generic 106541-04 sun4u SUNW,Ultra-5_10
>Description:
For server-side parsed files Apache appears to truncate URLs for which the
first part of the URLs is correct. E.g. any URL that begins http://server/index.html/...
or contains a space results in the first part of the file being returned.

If an html file contains a faulty link that results in the same file being
displayed. This causes robots accessing the page to continuously loop.

I am not able to switch off parsing of HTML file on my site. Nor can I guarantee
that all the links are free of erros/spaces etc.

Can you suggest a workaround please?
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to http://www.shu.ac.uk/schools/cms/peu/docs/forms.html and click on PEU. This points at a 
non-existesnt URL but displays the forms.html file again.

 Marc,
 
 I can't find any other replies to similar queries. A search for mod_include
 on http://bugs.apache.org/? doesn't come up with any. Incidentally the
 'Maximum number of records to return' on that page doesn't seem to work - it
 always returns just 20.
 
 I understand that you may have reasons to support this behaviour
 deliberately. Why just do it for server-parsed files though?
 
 Gary

 State-Changed-Why: 
 This is not a bug, but a feature.  If you have mod_include enabled then 
 Apache does this by design.  There are already dozens of "bug reports" 
 about the same thing, with the reasons why it does it explained clearly.
