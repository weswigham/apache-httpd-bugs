>Environment:
Ok, i've upgraded from linux 1.2.13  to  1.3.20 and from an earlier
apache release (1.0?) to the 1.2b7  
The compile didn't error out, as the 1.2b6 did and i never was able to get
it to properly compile.

>Description:
I'm using lnyx to test the apache server install, before i put it on line.
Prior to this i had used on the old softwar, netscape across the net. I will
try this with the current setup. 
However, every script, properly setup as far as i can tell and the same version
that ran prior to this, fails
The error log gives : [date] access to /usr/local/etc/apache/cgi-bin/Calendar_3.0/calendar.cgi
failed for blonde.yellowhead.com, reason: Premature end of script headers.

The access log shows :blonde.yellowhead.com [date/time +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.0"
200 868
blonde.yellowhead.com [time/date +0000] GET /cgi-bin/Calendar_3.0/calendar.cgi
HTTP/1.0" 500-

  
>How-To-Repeat:
script can be had at the following url, i took the tar file myself.

>Fix:
I'm not an expert, but no amount of tinkering with the .conf files nor
the script has presented a cure for me.%0

State-Changed-Why:
The script is broken; complain to the author.  They need
to disable perl's buffering.  It appears like they try,
but they do not do it correctly.  Try changing the line
saying:
	$! = 1;
to:
	$| = 1;
and it should help.  If not, contact the script author.
