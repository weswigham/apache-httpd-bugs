>Environment:
DEC Unix 4.0D
JDK 1.1.4
JSDK 2.0
Oracle 7 JDBC Thin Drivers 7.3.4
>Description:
The modules.html document has an invalid image URL.
The /jserv/ URL reports that is JServ 1.0b1 instead of 1.0b2.
The jserv.properties file has a "wrapper.classpath=" statement in it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, but these are minor install problems.
>Fix:
Edit modules.html: <h2 align="center"><img SRC="images/java-apache-project.gif"
I assume that you forgot to update the version number in the
http://hostname/jserv/ status pages.
The make file is generating a blank wrapper.classpath entry in the
jserv.properties file in the example directory.  This prevents the server
from starting up.
