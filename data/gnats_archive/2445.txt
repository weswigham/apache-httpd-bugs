State-Changed-When: Mon Jun 15 06:44:04 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the report and the patch.  I'll look into
fixing these.  The documentation is a bit dodgy, having
been compiled by numerous people over a long period of
time, and it definitely needs some rationalisation.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm closing this report because it is VERY old.
Many of these have been fixed, but I can't guarentee
that they all have.
