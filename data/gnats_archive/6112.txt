>Description:
I am using Apache HTTP Server 1.3.6 with Apache Jserv 1.0 for an Internet based email system.  My system is written with Java 1.1.7 and Java 1.2, which is heavily relied on lots of session values.  I used lots of codes to remember different clients' status, which are similar to the following:

    session.putValue(".....", "....."); 
    session.getValue(".....");
    
    [In average I have 50-300 session values per request ]

However, I found that some session values would "mess up" when I have more and more session requests.  Eventually, all the displayed information would scope up as result of the incorrect session values.  For example, I put down a set of session value for A, and another set of session values for B [those session values include their browser info, their unique ID and their password].  Initially, there is nothing wrong, client A and client B can only see their information.  However, when more and more clients log on to the system, client A may see client B information rather than his information.  If I restart the Apache, then everything would back to normal.

It seem to me, it is an internal bug in the Apache Jserv engine.  The session values are somehow reused without
some consistence checking in Apache/Jserv.  Do you have any suggestion for me to eliminate the problem?  I notice the Jserv 1.1.1 is just released, do you think if I upgrade to the new version would help?  Besides,  may I know if the bug is fixed in the new version, does it have any limitation on the number (or size) of session values?  How long would it clean up / refresh those session values?  

>How-To-Repeat:
runtime error that is hard to repeat!
You may load tons of session values in order to stress the Jserv and check each of the consistensy of each session value.
>Fix:
Increase your buffering size.  [I mean there must be something to hold all the session values.]
