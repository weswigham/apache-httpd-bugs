>Description:
The earlier versions of dbmmanage, atleast the ones that came with 1.2.x
supported adding group fields to the db files it generated via the adduser
command. The adduser command also used to run straight from the command line
and didn't prompt for a password.
Is it possible to get the old functionality back or atleast the group field part?
Apacheweek originally posted the the group stuff in their How to Use DBM auth article.
