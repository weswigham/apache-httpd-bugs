For any file with an extension such as `.ps.gz',
Apache returns

Content-Type: application/x-gzip
Content-Encoding: x-gzip

This is incorrect.  The content-type should be
application/postscript.

The following two-line patch helps.
But really you ought to rewrite the whole loop that processes
filename extensions.

State-Changed-Why:
The change you propose is bogus.  Consider a file named
foo.jpeg.gif.  Before your change it would be sent
as a gif, as it should, after it would be sent as a jpeg.

Your problem probably comes from having both a 
content-type and content-encoding for .gz files.  Remove
the AddType or entry in your mime.types for .gz files
and things will work as they should.
