IRIX ventus 5.3 11091812 IP22 mips
gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
Attempted to build Apache 1.3.1 using APACI on an IRIX 5.3 system with gcc. 
Failed to compile the code, here is the relevant part of the results of the
attempt:

[...]
===> src/ap
        gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DIRIX -DUSE_HSREGEX `../apaci` ap_execve.c
        gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DIRIX -DUSE_HSREGEX `../apaci` ap_cpystrn.c
        gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DIRIX -DUSE_HSREGEX `../apaci` ap_signal.c
        gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DIRIX -DUSE_HSREGEX `../apaci` ap_slack.c
        gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DIRIX -DUSE_HSREGEX `../apaci` ap_snprintf.c
ap_snprintf.c:1002: macro `va_start' used with too many (2) args
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
*** Error code 1 (bu21)
Exit 1

>How-To-Repeat:
probably if you have an IRIX 5.2 system available :)
I'm suspecting some strangeness with our libraries given the problem looks to be
with varargs handling, so this might be a problem specific to our system - 
but I thought I'd report it in case its useful. 
>Fix:
Not yet. I'm going to try to build 1.2.6 on the system and see if that works; The system 
is currently running 1.2b8.

 Please close this report. It looks like my system has a screwed setup in
 terms of varargs support in gcc and that this is shooting me in the foot in
 some manner that isn't apache's fault. Sorry for the bother.
 
 thanks.
