>How-To-Repeat:
I want to redirect the url http://www.myuser.mydomain.com to my local hard disk e:/user/1/users/myuser/index.html.

But the mod_rewrite is not working. When I type the http://www.myuser.mydomain.com it just show up the e:/user/1/index.html to me.

I view the rewrite log , it has logged nothing.

I searched the bug report it seems no one has reported 1.3.3 win32 has bug on the mod_rewrite. Please help, I have read through the apache server bible and cannot find the solution.

Do you think apache run in RedHat less bugs than NT4?

Thanks for advance.

 dosen't work.

 Please try a simpler rewrite to see if it works at all.

 Marc Slemko>>>>> Please try a simpler rewrite to see if it works at all.
 
 I have used a simpler rewrite but the apache seems not works at all, I
 use the netscape gold 3 to test the reasult
 (http://www.mydomain.com/foo.html) , it still shows me the foo.html at
 e:/apache/users/foo.html. :(
 
 Now lets look at my config file and log files at nt4 apache 1.3.3.
 
 It seems two problems there, first in the rewrite.log it shows the
 rewrite_mod has did somethings, it has found the /foo.html and try to
 rewrite it, but it has just pass through to the initial uri /foo.html it
 should be pass through to fool.31.html. Same thing happened at querys
 fooabc.html and fool.52.html.
 
 Also the access.log has problems too, HTTP/1.0 ???? I am using the
 netscape gold 3 ??? It should be HTTP/1.1 enabled.

                 ^^^
 You forgot a "/" after the "^" in your pattern.
 Use "^/foo\.html$" instead.
 
     RewriteRule ^foo\.html$             foo.31.html
