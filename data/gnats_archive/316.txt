 How often is every "once in a while"?  What sort of traffic (number of
 hits) does the server see and how often does the message appear?
 
 It normally happens when the client disconnects right before the
 server tries to set a particular option; I'm looking into changing the
 error message to be logged normally to the error log, but the message
 isn't normally anything to worry about.

State-Changed-Why:
Submitter reports they aren't happening overly frequently,
so they probably aren't anything to worry about.  The error
message will be changed in the next beta to log to the 
normal error log.

 Thanks for the response!  We get about 100,000 hits a day.  The other day 
 I saw that message come up about 5 times in 1 hour.  I any case thanks 
 for letting me know.
