BSD/OS 4.2, gcc 2.95.2    and Solaris 7, 2.95.3
>Description:
Ever since going to 1.3.22, we've run into alot of times where the system complains about
FollowSymLink not being set, when we never had to set it previously. We use a default
httpd.conf, and add :

    <Directory "/PATH/wwwcust">
        Options +Indexes +Includes 
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/PATH/wwwcust1">
        Options +Indexes +Includes 
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/PATH/wwwcust2">
        Options +Indexes +Includes
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

/PATH/wwwcust1 and /PATH/wwwcust2 is usually a normal directory on a data disk, and 
/PATH/wwwcust is a soft sym link to /PATH/wwwcustX/directory .  So, if we move the 
directory from wwwcust1 to wwwcust2, we just fix the link, and everything can still
point to the same place.

On a recent install, though, we had to add "+FollowSymLinks" to the Options of all those
lines. I can't see anywhere in the config it ISN'T turned on.... Without it, it won't
serve.

We also installed FrontPage, and get :

[Thu Dec 13 20:03:11 2001] [error] [client 65.105.161.248] Options FollowSymLinks or SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is off which implies that RewriteRule directive is forbidden: /usr/local/frontpage/version5.0/apache-fp/_vti_bin/fpexe

/usr is a real dir
/usr/local is /disk/usr/local
/usr/local/frontpage is really /disk/usr/local/frontpage
(Yadda)

/usr/local/frontpage/version5.0/apache-fp/_vti_bin/fpexe is really /disk//usr/local/frontpage/version5.0/apache-fp/_vti_bin/fpexe

I added :
    <Directory "/usr/local">
        Options +FollowSymLinks
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/disk/usr/local">
        Options +FollowSymLinks
    </Directory>

and it still is giving the error. 

I checked the database, and no other mention of a problem like this has happened for
a few years.  My understanding is that with the :


<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>


If I never do anything else, FollowSymLinks should be active for the entire server. 
Is this a misconception on my part?

 Is there any chance you also assigned an Options statement in either
 <Directory "/PATH"> or in a <Files > or <Location > block?  Or even in
 an .htaccess file in / or /PATH/ ?  Any of these could be interfering

 On the SUN in the httpd.conf :
 
 <Directory />
     Options FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride None
 </Directory>
 
 <Directory "/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs">
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
     AllowOverride None
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
 </Directory>
 
     <Directory "/usr/local/etc/httpd/icons">
         Options Indexes MultiViews
         AllowOverride None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>
 
     <Directory "/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/manual">
         Options Indexes FollowSymlinks MultiViews
         AllowOverride None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>
 
     <Directory "/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin">
         AllowOverride None
         Options None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>
 
     <Directory "/PATH/wwwcust">
         Options Indexes Includes +FollowSymLinks
         AllowOverride   All
     </Directory>
 
 <Directory "/PATH">
 Options +Indexes
 AllowOverride All
 </Directory>
 
 
 
 	As for .htaccess, we JUST built the server, and the content
 directory only had an index.html .
 
 
 
 BSDI:
 
 	There is an .htaccess in the directory with an "Options None". Is
 this doing it?  I believe FrontPage has always had this, and never run into
 this problem previously. Was this "fixed" at some point, or made stricter?
