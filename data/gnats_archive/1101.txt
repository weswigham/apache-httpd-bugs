>Description:
If a cgi script starts with "#!interp", it works. If it starts with
"#! interp" (note space before "interp"), it fails. Clearly this is
not serious, but for compatibility with scripts coming from Unix boxes
it would be nice if the code in util_script.c/call_exec() flushed
leading spaces from the interpreter's name.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put a space between "#!" and "interp" in a cgi script and run it.
>Fix:
At line 621 in util_script.c

    for(i = 2; interpreter[i] == ' '; ++i)
        ;
    interpreter = interpreter + i%3
