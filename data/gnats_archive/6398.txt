>Description:
Hi ,

I am trying to write a 404 Handler. See the following config parameters in httpd.conf


LoadModule  servlet_module modules/404Handler.dll

AddHandler servlet-handler .test
ErrorDocument 404 /missing.test

Whenever 404 error occurs(it should not matter whether it is a GET/POST) apache redirects the request to missing.test. Because I have registered a response handler for .test file, I get the request info. Everything is works fine if I access the previous request member (request_rec* prev) for GET request but if the request is redirected from POST then I am not able to get the posted form data and the method member variable is set to GET instead of POST. 

I would appreciate if some can shed light on this problem

Thanks

Regards
Sendhil Murugu
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Write a Handler module which should be nameds as servlet_module
2. Implement servlet-handler method
3. do the above mentioned config params in httpd.conf
4. write a simple html file with form which will post to http://localhost/test.htm ( make sure there is no file with test.htm in the server)
5. Apache will redirect request as specified in "ErrorDocument" config
6. Request will come to servlet-handler response handler
7. Try to read the posted form data.

State-Changed-Why:

This behavior is by design, for many reasons, including
security.  All redirected responses are translated into
GET requests.
