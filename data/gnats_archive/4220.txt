>Description:

It appears as though the Makefile.am are buggy in that they do not
prefix .deps with the source directory.  As a result, make shows:

Making all in src
make[1]: Entering directory `/opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3/obj/src'
Making all in c
make[2]: Entering directory `/opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3/obj/src/c'
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3/obj/src/c'
Making all in java
make[2]: Entering directory `/opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3/obj/src/java'
Makefile:192: .deps: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `.deps'.  Stop.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3/obj/src/java'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/opt/Apache-JServ-1.0b3/obj/src'
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

>How-To-Repeat:
Simply configure and make, like so
mkdir obj
cd obj
../configure --with-jsdk=...
make
>Fix:
Prefix references to files in the source tree with the source tree prefix.
