>Description:
Hello,

I needed for my work to have mod_rewrite to look in mysql database so I made a patch (the very first one I send, so tell me if I made a mistake). To apply this patch, "patch -p0 < mod_rewrite-mysql.patch" in the src/modules/standard/ directory seems to work (after un-gzip), but I'm not so familiar with that.

Here is what I added :

My new RewriteMap directive now support mysql as a type of map, the file specified after the ':' is a config file that may be like that (in RewriteMap txt format) :
server    mysqlserver.mydomain.org
port    3306
user    mylogin
passwd    mypassword
base    mydatabasename
select    select an_entry from mytable where myarg='$1' and mysecondarg like '$1%'

Note that port is optionnal (defaults to 3306) and select may have any number of $1. The $1 will be replaced by the key value (and it should be easy to change to something else if you prefer). If more than one entry is to be returned by mysql, only the first one will be return by RewriteMap. This is quite flexible because you can use several tables and anything after "where", keeping in mind that $1 will be the arg in httpd.conf RewriteRule.

For example :
RewriteMap mysqltest mysql:/path/to/myfile
RewriteRule ^/something$ ${mysqltest:azerty}
Will do this request : select an_entry from mytable where myarg='azerty' and mysecondarg like 'azerty%'

I hope I've done a clean work (I used the same structure that txt type, including pool and cache). I make as little changes as I could outside a NO_MYSQL_REWRITEMAP define.

I am just starting to test it for real and I'll contact you if I find anything but the code seems to work well.

I made one other change : I needed the subdomain name (like SERVER_NAME but without the ending mydomain.com), I added it, called SUBDOMAIN_NAME, there is no relation beetween the to patches but as it is a simple change with a few lines in the same file, I let it in this patch.

I let some comments in the code, hope it will help.

I think I will put this code in a web page in a few days. I can give you an URL later if you wish.

Hope I forgot nothing.

Have a good day.

Regis.
