Sorry if this has been handled, I didn't see anything beyond PR#2580.

Like the other report, I get "[Wed Jan 12 21:10:12 2000] [warn] long lost child came home! (pid 10770)"
in my error logs ONLY when doing a -USR1 restart. The pid for this child is
the pid of the /bin/sh process which is the parent of the logging process. Note
that I use two piped loggers, and this error occurs ONLY for the CustomLog piped
logger. The other piped logger is used via ErrorLog and produces no error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just do a kill -USR1 on the parent (root) Apache process when using a piped log
via the CustomLog directive. -HUP does NOT produce the error on my system.
>Fix:
I haven't had time to dig through the code for this yet, it really isn't THAT big
of a deal. I can always use -HUP, but I would rather not cut off the folks in 
mid-request, especially with our traffic levels.
