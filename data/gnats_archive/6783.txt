All fail(second page missing images, browser hang etc) most of the time, however
if you go the above URLs using port :82  (apache 1.3.12 server) All files 
download and display properly.
>Fix:
As mentioned above I changed the links that point to a pdf file, to use port
82 which is apache 1.3.12

State-Changed-Why:
This is a duplicate of PR#6711 so I am closing the report.
We are continuing to track the issue under #6711. Thanks
for the example URLs. Can you tell us which browser (including
version number) you are using and which version of the
acrobat plugin? Please follow up to #6711 by changing the
start of the subject line to "general/6711:" without the quotes.
