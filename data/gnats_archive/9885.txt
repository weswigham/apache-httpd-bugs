>Description:
I realize that this has been mentioned before, but I am not sure it has been submitted against 2.0.32.  Essentially, running ./configure --enable-layout is completely ignored, and apache attempts to install itself into /usr/local/apache2 anyway.

I have not seen anyone respond to any of those bug reports, and I am curious as to the current status of this bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download httpd-2.0.32-beta.tar.gz, tar -xzf, ./configure --enable-layout=anything.  Configure just ignores it and builds willy-nilly all over the place.
