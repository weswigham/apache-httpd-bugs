>Environment:
Linux alpha 2.0.33 #3 i586. Compiler: gcc
>Description:
If I start a cgi-script on my server, it only returns "500 Internal Server Error". A view into the error_log of 1.3b3 says following: [error](24)Too many open files: couldn't spawn child process: /home/cgi-bin/hidecounter.pl. 1.2.5 says the same.

I don't know what to do, all scripts ran before on the same server! User wwwrun has access to the files, I've increased the filedescriptors to 8196 (!).

Please help me!
