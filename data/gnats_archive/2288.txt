>Environment:
Linux eclectic 2.0.33 #2 Wed Apr 8 23:33:10 EDT 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
I (as do many people I imagine) compile apache as a normal user before installation.
However, the configure script checks for root privs if you use the '--enable-suexec' option.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run configure.
>Fix:
I suggest that the configure script not do the UID check, and instead (standard)
just let the install fail.  If I need root for suexec, I'll more than likely need
root to install the apache binary, which will also fail if I'm not root during
installation.  However, (as stated), root isn't needed for compilation.

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed for 1.3.0. The message is now only a warning
but the configure process and the building can be
proceeded. Thanks for your report.
