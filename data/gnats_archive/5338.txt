>Description:
RewriteRule directives with either P, R, or NS flags are ignored for subrequests. 
That's necessary for NS, ok for R, but quite strange for P. Such behaviour does
not allow to use <!--#include virtual="/somepath" --> so that /somepath gets
requested from another server via mod_proxy.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the following into httpd.conf:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/something http://other.host/something [P]

Create a shtml document containing the following:

<!--#include virtual="/somepath" -->

Try to access your shtml document. Mod_include returns error. 
>Fix:
Apply the following patch.
