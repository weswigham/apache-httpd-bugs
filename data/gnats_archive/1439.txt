>Release:        1.3b3
>Environment:
Windows NT 5.0 Beta
Netscame Communicator 4.04
Winzip version 6.2
>Description:
There seems to be a mismatch between the filenames stored on your server and 
what comes back to my browser when I download the .tar.gz archives from your
web site. This arises when using the "HTTP" download; I'm reasonably certain 
that it would not occur with an FTP download.

In this particular instance, I downloaded the new beta apache_1.3b3.tar.gz but
when Winzip was asked to load it after the download, I get an error from Winzip 
saying "error reading header after 0 entries".

If I look for the saved file after the download, I find a file called 
apache_1.3b3_tar.tar which is NOT what it was called in the directory listing.
If I rename it back to apache_1.3b3.tar.gz and then open it with Winzip, all
is well. So, it looks like the name passed back along with the file was somehow
mangled, which causes a problem for tools like Winzip.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using Communicator and Winzip under Windows 95 or NT, download an archive e.g. 
apache_1.3b3.tar.gz from your site.
>Fix:
Look at your server for how you are mapping file types. It seems to be a
configuration problem of some kind.

If the server always likes to translate filenames with multiple separators (dots)
for the benefit of those DOS users that don't seem to go away, maybe the solution
would be to translate .tar.gz to .tgz which Winzip and Gnu's gzip/gunzip both
recognize.

State-Changed-When: Wed Dec 10 15:58:56 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:

This is a browser problem. Your browser uncompresses
the archive on-the-fly when you download it.
You may want to turn of this 'feature' in your
browser if you don't like it, but there is nothing
we can do about it.
