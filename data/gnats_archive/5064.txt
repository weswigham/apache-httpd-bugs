Linux-2.2.5-15, apache was installed from .rpm
>Description:
My configuration:

# default is ExecCGI off
<Directory ~>
   AllowOverride None
   Options None
</Directory>

# for me is ExecCGI on
# I tested set directory name to full directory, but still not operate...
<Directory ~jmarek>
   AllowOverride Options AuthConfig Limit
   Options ExecCGI Indexes Includes
</Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.pf.jcu.cz/~jmarek/ , then click to start cgi script
>Fix:
I tested previous version apache-1.3.6 with the same error. I tried debug
code for parsing configuration: it was look OK. But if I tried debug code for
testing access, I got wrong permission for executing CGI. I mean, that error
is in this code?

State-Changed-Why:

Your configuration is wrong.  <Directory> controls
parameters for directories on disk, not URLs.  In
addition, the '~' character is special for several
container directives including <Directory>; it indicates
a regular expression.  Use '/home/<username>' instead
of a URI path in your directives, and read the documentation
on <Directory> and <DirectoryMatch>.  Thanks for using
Apache!
