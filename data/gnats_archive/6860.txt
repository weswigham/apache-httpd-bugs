>Description:
I just installed Apache. When tryinf to start it the Dos Window opens but then immediatly closes
 again. The error log shows the following message:
[Sat Nov 18 10:37:49 2000] [crit] make_sock: failed to get a socket for port 80

I installed Apache to use it as a localhost to test some CGI scripts.

I tried searching the your database and reveiwing the documentation in 
hpptd.conf but couldnt find anything about make_sock. Since the program itself
is generating this error message, there must be a database of causes. Where do I 
look?
>How-To-Repeat:
Install the above software on a win95 computer?
>Fix:
First time using server software. Learning to write CGI scripts and want to use
apache to test them as localhost. Possibly the conficuration otherwise,
Dont have a clue!

 I suspect "Web Washer" is causing the problem, but I don't know why it
 should continue to get in the way after being deinstalled.

 There is no such database; the errors are supposed to be
 self-explanatory. In this case it typically means that some other
 program has bound to port 80 which prevents Apache from doing so.

State-Changed-Why:

This is a configuration error... the command

netstat -an

should identify what application has port 80 open, or else
the winsock2 update was not installed.
