Slackware Linux  Kernel 2.0.35  compiler egcs
>Description:
If you go to any Apache site running 1.3.2 whose administrator hasn't changed
the default 404 reply, you will get the full pathname of where Apache is installed.
This could be a security hazard.

For example, here's a sample 404 reply of trying to go to the below URL
which has a random directory name appended on to it.

Not Found

File does not exist: /usr/local/apache/htdocs/fodkfokdf 
>How-To-Repeat:
http://dsm.surf-ici.com/fodkfokdf
http://dsm.surf-ici.com/s89349.html
http://dsm.surf-ici.com/(any random old non-existant thing)
>Fix:
Just go back to the way it used to be so the user would only see the not-found
directory in relation to the htdocs directory, not in relation to the whole
unix filesystem.

This should be fixed by a patch being committed now.
I'll send it to you separately if you want to try it.
