>Description:
I'm trying to test whether the HTTPS env var is set to "on" and use this fact
to determine when a redirect rule should be executed.  The rule redirects
to a secure URL and is only supposed to execute if the connection is not secure.

My rewrite condition is
  RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPS} !="on"

The rewrite log indicates that:
  input='' pattern='!="on"' => matched
for a non-SSL request, and then
  input='on' pattern='!="on"' => matched
for an SSL request.  The latter is in error.  The subsequent rule is executed
when it shouldn't.
>How-To-Repeat:
httpd.conf section (these lines are within a <Location> section):

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
<IfDefine SSL>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPS} !="on"
    RewriteRule ^/(.*)  https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}      [L,R]
</IfDefine>
</IfModule>
</Location>

My rewrite log shows:

>Fix:
My workaround is to use this rewrite condition:

    RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPS} ^$

 The correct syntax is:
 
     RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPS} !=on
 
 i.e. without the quotation marks!

 Fair enough, I guess.  However:
 
 a) isn't this counter-intuitive, especially as two quotes "" are used to
 compare an empty string? and
 b) how would I compare with a string with embedded spaces if quotes
 aren't permitted?
