>Release:        1.3.3, 1.0b3
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, JDK 1.1.7.  JServ is statically linked in to
Apache (ie: no DSO).
>Description:
I'm trying to use a thick JDBC driver which requires runtime access
to Oracle dynamic libraries.  Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
running Apache+JServ results in a Unsatisfied Link Error when
the JVM can't find the .so library for the JDBC driver.  The 
only place I could successfully have the driver be found in was
the apache bin directory, but then it couldn't find any of the
other Oracle libraries, and couldn't even spit out a sensible
Java error.

I tried using PassEnv from mod_env to make LD_LIBRARY_PATH be
passed along, but that didn't make any difference.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't have a nice small example for you at the moment; I'm kinda
in the midst of figuring out how the hell I'm going to work around
this.
>Fix:
JServ needs to pass the same environment variables to the Java runtime
that would be passed to a CGI script, particularly things like 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or LPATH, or whatever is appropriate for a given O/S).

 This isn't a bug, it is a configuration error...
