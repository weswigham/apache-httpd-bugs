>Release:        1.2b6 with four patches
>Environment:
AIX 4.1.5, xlC 3.1.3	
>Description:
http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html says:

For example, consider the situation with three variants: 

      foo.en.html, language en 
      foo.fr.html, language en 
      foo.html, no language 

The meaning of a variant with no language is that it is always acceptable to
the browser. If the request Accept-Language header includes either en or fr (or
both) one of foo.en.html or foo.fr.html will be returned. If the browser does
not list either en or fr as acceptable, foo.html will be returned instead.

I tried to create files foo.html.de, foo.html.en, and foo.html.  Using Netscape
(Mac version, should it matter) asking for 'de' (german) as prefered language,
this returns foo.html.  If I remove foo.html, foo.html.de will be returned as
expected.  (Using foo.en.html, foo.de.html, and foo.html will also return
foo.html if it exists, and give an error otherwise.)  It appears to me that the
existance of a file foo.html as default means that the server always sends that
file, regardless of whether the client asks for a particular language or not.
Have I missed something?

I'm using Apache 1.2b6 with the four patches applied.

A HowTo guide explaning how to set up links within a multiple language server 
would be nice.  It appears that the co-existance with MS IE 3 is particulary
difficult.

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.its.uu.se/foo

contains:

 ll foo
total 16
-rw-r--r--   1 root     web         3355 Feb 12 17:43 foo.html
-rw-r--r--   1 root     web          579 Feb 12 17:05 foo.html.de
-rw-r--r--   1 root     web         3355 Feb 12 17:05 foo.html.en

State-Changed-Why:
Apologies for the delay in getting back to you.
Some changes were made in the area of negociation.  Can
you reproduce this with a more recent beta (such as
1.2b8 or 1.2b10)?  What happens if you ask for "foo" rather
than "foo.html"?

State-Changed-Why:
If a file named "foo.html" exists apache will return that
when asked for foo.html, regardless of the existance of
foo.html.de, foo.html.fr, etc. and the Accept-Languages
header.  To do otherwise is a performance pig.  You should
be able to work around this with .var files, or by naming
the files "foo.fr.html", "foo.de.html", "foo.html" and
referring to the object as simply "foo".

Thanks for using Apache!
