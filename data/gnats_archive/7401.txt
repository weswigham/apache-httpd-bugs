Win2000, Apache 1.3.19 usual binary installer, ActiveState Perl 5.6, + mod_perl, NTMLAuth,
>Description:
When I have Apache 1.3.19 installed as a service, then when the machine is rebooted Apache begins answering on every IP assigned to that machine. IIS sites are supposed to answer on several of the IPs, but it reports that the port is busy when I start the IIS web. If I shut down the Apache service, start the IIS webs, and then start Apache, everything is well-behaved. It seems that Apache is greedy about the IPs.
I have the following (relevant?) lines in my config file:
Listen 206.68.42.20:80
BindAddress 206.68.42.20
ServerName webassign2.northpark.edu

I've also tried removing those lines and using VirtualHosts:
NameVirtualHost 206.68.42.20
<VirtualHost 206.68.42.20>
    ServerAdmin LMartin@northpark.edu
    DocumentRoot d:/webassign/apache/htdocs
    ServerName webassign2.northpark.edu
    ErrorLog logs/error.log
    CustomLog logs/access.log common
</VirtualHost>

In this case, the Apache takes over from IIS no matter what order I start them in!

Shouldn't this answer only on 206.68.42.20:80? Why would Apache be able to begin answering on other IPs like 206.68.42.18 which is assigned a different name in the DNS?
>How-To-Repeat:
Since this is on our production machines, I hesitate to play much longer; the webmaster is pretty upset when my server takes over the institutional web presence.
>Fix:
No.

Can you try it with JUST the Listen directive or
JUST the BindAddress directive, but NOT both, and see
if that helps?

 I tried those suggestions across several days 
 (it's frustrating to wait a day to bounce the server) 
 and now I sadly report that Apache is still being rude to IIS 
 (or IIS is being a wimp). 
 Having only Listen or BindAddress did not help. Any more ideas?
 
 thanks,
 Larry

I'm changing this back to "open" status, because I don't
know enough about the windows platform to diagnose this
further.

State-Changed-Why:

I just reproduced the scenario using

Listen 123.45.67.89:80
exactly once, no other enabled occurances
(careful not to keep a Listen 80 around!)

#BindAddress
is entirely commented out

Port 80
which does nothing more than tell the server what port
to advertise as it's identity, not what port to listen to.

And netstat -an reports I'm listening on exactly one port.

Please try _carefully_ and slowly repeating this scenario,
dropping every occurance of BindAddress, dropping out all
the vhost stuff, and this will work for you.

Good luck!

 I realize this thread is a little old, but my problem is identical to =
 7401 and I  have not been able to find the solution to this problem =
 elsewhere. =20
 
 If the apache service is started BEFORE IIS, then it seems to steal all =
 the addresses on the specified port.  If the two applicaions use =
 different port numbers, there is no obvious conflict.  If IIS is started =
 first, both IIS and apache seem to play well together, until you STOP =
 the IIS sites on the specified port (as soon as IIS gives them up, =
 apache steals them!).
 
 I have checked over all the included files as well as the  httpd.conf to =
 be sure there arent extra uncommented bindaddress or port or listen =
 directives (there are none).  Using bindaddress & port or listen, I get =
 apache to respond properly to web requests (only to the bound =
 address/port or the listen address/port gives a response to the =
 browser).  Even though there is no web response to the other IP =
 addresses on the machine, IIS seems to think the address/port is in use =
 and the IIS will not startup.
 
 Is there a solution to this other than delaying the start of the apache =
 service until IIS is up and running? =20
 
 Any help will be appreciated...  Thanks.. Brian
