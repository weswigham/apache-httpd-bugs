>Environment:
WinNT4 Server VC++ 7 (beta1) 
>Description:
As I understand it (havn't dug deep into this) the pointer:
extern ap_directive_t *ap_conftree;
is already declared somewhere.
VC++ message: mod_info.c(108) : warning C4273: 'ap_conftree' : inconsistent dll linkage.  dllexport assumed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile mod_info.c
>Fix:
Comment out the declaration. Works(?)

after the previous alpha.  The next alpha or beta will contain
the fix.

Thanks for your report.
