>Environment:
Linux 2.2.14-5.0 #1
>Description:
I can use Apache proxy cache with proxypass and proxypassReverse directives to cache many sites, including Yahoo, Microsoft etc. but when I access www.now.com, Apache 'seems' not caching any since none of the sub-directories are created. WWW.NOW.COM uses Weblogic as server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Please access www.now.com and see if Apache can cache the site. Usually sub-directories will be generated when caching other sites, but not for this site www.now.com
>Fix:
I use Winproxy software and it can cache this site www.now.com
