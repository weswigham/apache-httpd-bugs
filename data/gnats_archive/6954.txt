>Originator:     todd@wisernet.com
>Release:        1.3.14
>Organization:
>Environment:
Netware 5.1 running Dual Zeon Processor, 512mb ram, and 20+ apache web sites.
Novell OS
Apache
Netscape Enterprise server
>Description:
1. When enabling SSL, (documentation non-existant) server reboots when loading apache. 
2. Basically to add or delete sites, you modify config file, unload and reload apache. If
   you do this 3 or 4 times, you get a apache programming error to the effect of
   ut-oh, out of memory. Server has to be rebooted.
3. When enabling almost any other module or deviating from the barren startup config
   the server crashes and restarts.
4. Although undocumented, the procedure for load/unload also may have change, but
   I tried it both ways, to no avail.
>How-To-Repeat:
add secondary address (primary runs novell stuff, and netscape server)
configure apache to use secondary ip address.

load address space = apache apache
unload address space apache apache
or unload apache (worked in previous release)
repeat 4-5 times, usually produced the error. This is NOT a problem in PRIOR release.
I had to discontinue use of product, to unstable. 
>Fix:
Maybe the developer could work closer with someone like me, who is actually trying to
use it for a production sort of environment, hey, you never know...maybe we could help..
Love apache, would like to see further novell development, perhaps a forum on the forums
at novell could inspire others to contribute (i'm not a programmer). simon says take
2 steps forward, take 4 steps back...

>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: bnicholes
State-Changed-When: Fri Apr  6 07:51:29 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The problem was due to the fact that unloading apache did completely unload all of the external modules.  This left ApacheC.NLM un an unknown state.  The next time Apache.NLM was loaded, ApacheC.NLM could not handle the request appropriately.  A patch has been checked into CVS to make sure that the external modules are unloaded correctly on shutdown.  This patch will not be available until after version 1.3.19.
