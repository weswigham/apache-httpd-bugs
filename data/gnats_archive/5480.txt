>Environment:
Linux RedHat 6.1, kernel 2.2.12-20, gcc, Netscape 4.5
>Description:
I am using the RedHat 6.1 and Kernel 2.2.12-20. The origianl RedHat Apache installation is disabled. I install Aapche 1.3.9 seperately with the apache_1.3.9.tar.gz. downloaded from apache.org. My compilation and installation didnot give any error and I was greeted with the message, "your apache is installed successfuly and may be started by apachectl start."

Apache started succesfully and with ps -aux, it showed the 5 running apache servers as deamons as /usr/local/apache/httpd.

However, when I try to access the http via the Netscape browser in RedHat, I got the following problem, no page is displayed, error message returned form Browser as "you do not have access to / on this server. Error 403."

I checked the error log on apache and there is no record of any fault. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a fresh RedHat 6.1 with out any server support.
Set host name to localhost.localdomain.
Working as Root.
Download apache_1.3.9 from apache.org and do ./configure --prefix/usr/local/apache, make, make install.
Start apache by /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start.
Open Netscape and enter URL:localhost.localdomain.
