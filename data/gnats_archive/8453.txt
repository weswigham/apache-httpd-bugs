>Description:

The code is dereferencing the wrong event variable at line 215.  
Here is a correct patch.  I've also fixed the logic for the case where there
are multiple events ORed together in the events list.

     newevents = get_event(events);

-        if (aprset->events[i] & newevents) {
-            aprset->events[i] ^= newevents;

         }
         i++;
     }
>How-To-Repeat:
I was trying to write a module which used this routine.  It should always
fail because the current code dereferences a NULL pointer.
>Fix:
See patch above.
