>Environment:
freebsd 2.2.2 release
>Description:
     I'm running 2.2.2-RELEASE, since mid-July, and APACHE 1.2B10 since about that same time.  I downloaded APACHE 1.2.4 for FreeBSD and loaded the BINARY httpd from the /src (starts out as httpd-i386-whatever-freebsd).  Copied "old" httpd to httpd.old and copied "new" httpd-whatever to httpd.  

     Would not work as it said (1) could not find "fopen" , and it kept looking for .conf files in wrong places.  I COPIED the .conf files to SEVERAL places trying to make them available, but it would NEVER find them.

     I finally (1:30am) gave up and copied httpd.old back as httpd, and the OLD stuff works fine...

     Who else is using 1.2.4 and how did you make it work ????

    (this message will also go to APACHE.org )

THANKS !!

State-Changed-Why:
This is a configuration question, not a bug report.

You probably installed the FreeBSD port origially, which
used different paths.  If you want to upgrade you
need to either grab the source and fix the paths yourself
or just grab the latest port
(ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/www/apache/)
and compile that which already has the paths changed.
