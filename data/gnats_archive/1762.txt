Using Apache 1.2.1 on a Sun Sparc 4, running Solaris 2.5.
>Description:
I would like to authenticate users against a directory service (similar to the 
method provided by Netscape's Directory Server), using the Lightweight Database 
Access Protocol (LDAP), and wondered if an LDAP enhancement has been added to 
the project plan?  If so, is there a estimated completion date?

Please accept my apology if this is the incorrect method for asking questions.

State-Changed-Why:
As is made clear before you go to the bug reporing form,
it is for bugs, not for questions or support, etc.  We
really don't have the time for that.  Other ways to get
that are given.

In this case, a good idea would be to search for ldap
in the Apache Module Registry; a link from there is available
from the related projects page off the main Apache web
page.
