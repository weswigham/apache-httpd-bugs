Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.6
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Solaris 270 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to NOT-AVAILABLE
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
cpp: installation problem, cannot exec `cpp': Not enough space
make: *** [dummy] Error 1
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration

 Aborting!

I have gcc installed in /usr/local/bin on my computer and also Sun Workshop 5.0 installed as well.
My PATH is :
PATH=/opt/GNUzip/root/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/space/usr/local/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin:.

Why I get message about compiler and how can I fix it?

Thanks,

Tatiana

State-Changed-Why:
This is a problem with your gcc installation.  Apache
requires a working C compiler installed; your C compiler
is giving the error message you get.  You need to talk
to the people that produce it to figure out why that is.
