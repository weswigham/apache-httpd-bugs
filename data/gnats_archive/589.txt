State-Changed-Why:
Does pressing Reload on the browser fetch the correct page
if the problem is fixed at the remote server?

State-Changed-Why:
Stale PR; can not reproduce.  The only reason I can think
that this would happen is if the remote server had some
sort of redirect that returned a 200 code for an error
document.  You could say that server is broken then.

If this is reproducable and still an issue, please let
us know.
