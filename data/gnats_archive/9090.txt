apache

There is a serious bug in the apache 1.3.22 configuration when using a custom LAYOUT in which the documentation for some reason installs into the /
directory and then proceeds to charg the entire system.
>Description:
here is a layout I have used for years now to cause a problem
where the documentation will for some reason install in root directory /
and then proceed to charg the entire system and basically can destroy a servers security

<Layout MyNetwork>

    sbindir:       $bindir
    libexecdir:    $exec_prefix/libexec
    datadir:       $prefix/www
    iconsdir:      $datadir/icons
    htdocsdir:     $datadir/htdocs
    cgidir:        $datadir/cgi-bin
