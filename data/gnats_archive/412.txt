I have noticed this before, but have heretofore been able to work around it.  Now I'm stuck.

If you use an SSI to execute a CGI, all the headers from the CGI are not passed through to the browser.
Specifically, I have tried this with headers "Set-cookie" and "Expires", with no luck.  I think "Status"
goes through, but have not verified that.

The reason why I have encountered this now is because Netscape will (moronically) cache SSI's or CGI's if 
you set it to 'never' check cached items.  By sending an 'Expires' header, a CGI will be forced to decache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just make a simple CGI that sets a cookie, and call it with an SSI.  Did you get the cookie?
>Fix:
Certainly -- send those headers on through! :-)%0
