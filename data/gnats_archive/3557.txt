State-Changed-When: Fri Dec 18 11:11:49 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is for Apache bug reports, not for basic configuration
questions.  Appropriate locations for such things are
clearly described before you submit a bug report.

In any case, Apache is a web proxy and doe snot magically proxy
mail.
