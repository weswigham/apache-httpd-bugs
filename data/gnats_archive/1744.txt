Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.7.2.1/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.1

pretty standard Apache install, except following extra modules have been added:
mod_jserv, mod_php, mod_php3 (with mysql support)
>Description:
Given a ~user/.htaccess:

Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /~user
RewriteRule ^test notfound.html

and no file named notfound.html, I get:
% telnet localhost 80
GET /~user/test HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 404 File Not Found
Date: Fri, 30 Jan 1998 11:05:34 GMT
Server: Apache/1.2.5
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>404 File Not Found</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>File Not Found</H1>
The requested URL /~user/notfound.html was not found on this server.<P>
</BODY></HTML>

However, the server log entry for this request will be:

127.0.0.1 - - [30/Jan/1998:13:12:56 +0200] "GET /~user/test HTTP/1.0" 200 170 "-" "-"

Note that the hit is not logged as 404 Not Found, but as 200 OK.
>How-To-Repeat:
Hopefully the above .htaccess will repeat it..

State-Changed-Why:
I've tested this now both under 1.2.5 and 1.3b6-dev and
I both times get the correct answer in my access.log:

192.76.162.40 - - [24/Feb/1998:16:20:29 +0100] "GET /~rse/test HTTP/1.0" 404 162

Additionally I cannot see any reason why an URL
manipulation by mod_rewrite should lead to a
200 response although the file does not exists.
Because mod_rewrite does not handle this itself
and the content handlers do not know anything
about mod_rewrite's URL manipulations (or at
least do not check for them).

It has to to something with the particular additional
modules (mod_jserv, mod_php) the user uses or with
its local configuration. But I cannot find an error
in mod_rewrite here.
