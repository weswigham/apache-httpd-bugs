>Unformatted:
I've encountered similar problem with PR number 2229.

My environment is,
    apache_1.3b7
    SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
    bind-4.9.7-REL
    gcc-2.7.2.1

    httpd.conf
       HostnameLookups off
       LogFormat "%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
       CustomLog var/log/httpd/access_log common

Outside mod_log_config there are also same problem.
For example, REMOTE_ADDR, which is an enviromental value in CGI via mod_cgi,
and Host field of /server-status via mod_status.
Sometimes these are also only the first octet of the IP address.

These values are not resolved value,
so I think it's not resolver problem.

I insert debugging code into fucntion "new_connection" (in http_main.c).
conn->remote_ip is always no problem, so inet_ntoa works well.

I'm wondering where it lacks rests of IP address......

Apahce_1.2.6 works without these problem, so I use it for the present.
