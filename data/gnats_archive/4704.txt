>Organization:
>Environment:
RedHat 5.2, kernel 2.0.36.  Apache 1.3.6, w/o patches
>Description:
Some pages appear as html source code instead of web pages.  This problem occurs predominantly in Netscape -various versions-, but I have seen it happen in Internet Explorer as well (different versions).
>How-To-Repeat:
Seems to only occur in Netscape when loading pages ending in .htm as opposed to .html.  
>Fix:
Edit mime.types in the configuration directory.  Change the line that says:
text/html     html htm
---- to -----
text/html     htm html

This seems to fix the problem.
