apache
>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
Using Red Hat Linux 6.0 w/, but, looking at the source it should occur in all OSs
>Description:
Modern Browsers, even those that claim HTTP/1.1 compliance, do not properly support 407s, Proxy-Authenticate, and Proxy-Authorization headers.  When using a proxy connection, Apache always uses these methods for authentication.  Therefore, browsers are unable to get authorization.
>How-To-Repeat:
Our setup uses a ProxyPass with Authorization requirements on both sides of the Proxy
>Fix:
I have a patch available at http://members.wri.com/johnnyb/
