>Environment:
Windows 95, VC++ 5.0
>Description:
When compiling on Windows with VC++ 5.0, the ap_send_error_response
symbol is not exported from the ApacheCore.dll. This function
is needed by the mod_dtcl module, and probably by other modules
as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile mod_dtcl on Windows.
>Fix:
Just add the symbol to the def-file as follows:

*** src/ApacheCore.def.orig	Mon Nov 01 16:40:30 1999
--- src/ApacheCore.def	Mon Nov 01 16:41:02 1999
