State-Changed-Why:
What platform are you using?

I've built apr-util on a few Unix flavors today with no problem.
If you don't have libaprutil.a, I guess apache won't build,
right?  You're looking in srclib/apr-util/.libs for
libaprutil.a, right?

Thanks,

Jeff

Comment-Added:
Some fixes were made to srclib/apr-util/Makefile.in which
should resolve the problem you encountered.  Please try
the latest code from CVS and update the problem report
with your experience.

Thanks!
