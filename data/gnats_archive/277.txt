State-Changed-Why:
Apache does not have built in support for the PUT method.
You can write your own script and use a directive 
like "Script PUT /cgi-bin/script.cgi".  There are various
security concerns involved that need to be resolved before
we can include any worthwhile PUT handler.  

The easiest solution is to just tell Netscape to use
ftp (you know, the way things have worked for years and
years...) to upload pages.  Instead of giving it 
http://whatever to upload to, give it ftp://host/full/path
