>Description:
ErrorDocument 404 /cgi/errordoc.cgi
RewriteRule /cgi/errordoc.cgi http://dave.bepress.com:1101/cgi/errordoc.cgi/<%{REDIRECT_URL}> [QSA,P]

I was hoping to use ErrorDocument for a large portion of my site -
static pages served when they're there, use a proxy to pull from
another server when things aren't there.

Unfortunantly, it appears that mod_rewrite does not have access to
the environment variables that ErrorDocument creates for inteligent
handling of errors.
>How-To-Repeat:
Turn on mod_rewrite.
Define an error document.
Try to use the REDIRECT_* variables in the rewrite rule.
