>Description:
RFC 822 specifies the date format:

 5.  DATE AND TIME SPECIFICATION

     5.1.  SYNTAX

     date-time   =  [ day "," ] date time        ; dd mm yy
                                                 ;  hh:mm:ss zzz

     day         =  "Mon"  / "Tue" /  "Wed"  / "Thu"
                 /  "Fri"  / "Sat" /  "Sun"

     date        =  1*2DIGIT month 2DIGIT        ; day month year
                                                 ;  e.g. 20 Jun 82

     month       =  "Jan"  /  "Feb" /  "Mar"  /  "Apr"
                 /  "May"  /  "Jun" /  "Jul"  /  "Aug"
                 /  "Sep"  /  "Oct" /  "Nov"  /  "Dec"

     time        =  hour zone                    ; ANSI and Military

     hour        =  2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT [":" 2DIGIT]
                                                 ; 00:00:00 - 23:59:59

     zone        =  "UT"  / "GMT"                ; Universal Time
                                                 ; North American : UT
                 /  "EST" / "EDT"                ;  Eastern:  - 5/ - 4
                 /  "CST" / "CDT"                ;  Central:  - 6/ - 5
                 /  "MST" / "MDT"                ;  Mountain: - 7/ - 6
                 /  "PST" / "PDT"                ;  Pacific:  - 8/ - 7
                 /  1ALPHA                       ; Military: Z = UT;
                                                 ;  A:-1; (J not used)
                                                 ;  M:-12; N:+1; Y:+12
                 / ( ("+" / "-") 4DIGIT )        ; Local differential
                                                 ;  hours+min. (HHMM)

State-Changed-Why:
1. the current mod_usertrack (1.2.4 and 1.3b2) only
   creates Cookies according to Netscapes "old" Cookie
   proposal, because the "new" one (RFC 2109) has 
   "Max-Age" instead of "Expires".

2. While Netscape says in their proposal under
   http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html)
   the date format is ...DD-MM-YYYY... and this follows
   RFC822, etc. 

So, it is not clear what the actual format is, because
RFC822 says ...DD MM YYYY.., the proposal says
...DD-MM-YYYY... and Apache uses ...DD-MM-YY...
But either way Apaches current format is more like Netscapes
one than the one from RFC822. So, when mod_usertrack
should be fixed, then better to DD-MM-YYYY instead of
RFC822's variant, I think. Or even better: mod_usertrack
should use the format of RFC 2109 when it becomes a
valid draft and browsers support it.

Or I'm totally wrong here? Correct me please.
