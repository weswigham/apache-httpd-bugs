>Environment:
Trying to compile and run on NCR MP-RAS 3.0.1
$ uname -a
UNIX_SV unxncr 4.0 3.0 3435 Pentium(TM)-MCA 
>Description:
Compile and link went fine, but

./httpd -f /u3/apache_1.2.4/conf/httpd.conf

resulted in segmentation fault.

Used the UNIX command 'strings core | pg' where the last output seemed to show
the httpd stopping during or after reading /etc/passwd.

httpd was started with 'root' userid. httpd was configured with nobody/nobody.
tried nouser/nouser but received same result.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
nope. tried modifing compile/link. Had initial problem with linker choking on 
'reg...' symbols. Added other directories which cured linking problem

State-Changed-Why:
Do you have a debugger (eg. gdb) on the box that you
could use to see where it is dying?

You could try 1.3b3, but I doubt it would be fixed.

It is very difficult for us to do anything to fix this
if you don't have a debugger to track it down...
