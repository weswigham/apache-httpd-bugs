Red Hat 6.1. Apache 1.3.22. PHP 4.0.6. Can't give you much other info, it's on a shared host that I don't have much access to. Sorry.
>Description:
When using content negotiation to call a PHP file without specifying the ".php" extention in the URL (e.g., http://www.foo.com/products/categories to call a file called "categories.php"), if a query string is applied, it is completely lost--PHP does not see it, and the QUERY_STRING environment variable is empty. So, if I were to call http://www.foo.com/products/categories?catid=5, I wouldn't get category ID 5, because the PHP script would not have a $catid variable defined.
