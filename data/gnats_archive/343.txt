>Environment:
Apache (all versions tested through 1.2b3) FreeBSD 2.1.5, 2.2, 3.0 gcc and cc
compilers
>Description:

For scripts that simply display 1 graphic, apache logs the bandwidth used
by this graphic perfectly well. When the script is "streaming" graphics as
is the case for server-push type applications, there is no bandwidth reported
over a few hundred bytes. This is the case whether the stream transfers 20k or 2000k.

>How-To-Repeat:
Please contact me if needed, I suspect that running any URLs I give you 
won't be any help w/o being able to see the logs. 
>Fix:
?? No idea ?? -- Some system level call to watch how much data has been 
read from the input stream?%0

State-Changed-Why:
I'm guessing your streaming script is an nph-cgi, in which
case it is impossible for apache to count the bytes sent since
it hands the client socket directly to the cgi and the cgi
is responsible for managing it.  Is that the case?
