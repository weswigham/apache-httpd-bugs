I am using BackOffice Server and Apache 1.3.1 for Win32.
>Description:
I installed Apache 1.3.1 over 1.3b6 and scripts(as in 1.3b7) do not work again. The error is the same:
[Fri Jul 24 12:02:35 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: d:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/counter98.cgi

The file is in that directory and the path to perl is correct(this script worked while 1.3b6 was started)


Please reply or send instructions what to do to andrew@wolf.ru

State-Changed-Why:
This looks like PR2495 (fix has been committed). 

You can confirm it with a test: move your cgi to a 
directory path that does not contain white spaces (and 
update ScriptAlias. Try running it and update the PR 
with the results.

Thanks,
