>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Server - Service Pack 5
>Description:
I have installed Apache on drive e:, when I edit httpd.conf, changing the line 'DocumentRoot "e:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/htdocs"' to read 'DocumentRoot "f:/web"' and changing the corresponding '<Directory "e:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/htdocs">' to read '<Directory "f:/web">' and then stop the Apache NT Service, and attempt to restart it again, Apache times-out, doesn't restart, throws the error 'Could not start the Apache service on \\MYSERVER. Error 2186: The service is not responding to the control function.'. This does not occur if I change my document root (in the above two lines) to point to 'e:/web'.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache to a given drive letter, install it as a service, attempt to configure document root to be a drive other than where Apache is installed, start/restart the service.
>Fix:
The simple workaround I'm using is to ensure the document root is on the same drive as Apache.

State-Changed-Why:
Is your f: drive network mounted or is it local? Check the
access permissions of the drive. I suspect this is a permissions problem

 My f: drive is a local drive, and not a network drive.
 
 All permissions on all drives are identical, having the default NT
 permissions throughout. We've not implictly tightened the security as our
 servers are used for development purposes only (on an intranet behind a
 firewall).
