State-Changed-Why:
Who are you starting the server as when you try to run
it on port 80?  It needs to be started by root to bind
to port 80.

Try removing all Listen directives, set it to some port
without anything else on and try starting it as root.

Do you get the accept ... permission denied errors when
running it on any port or just 80?

You are only including the "//"s for showing what you tried,
correct, and they aren't actually in your config file?
