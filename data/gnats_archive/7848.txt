>Description:
If you try to connect to a virtual host starting with a "/" this will result in an error BUT will add a line to the access file. If one uses split-logfiles to separate the logfile by host name, it is possible to append these log lines to any file in the filesystem that is writable by the user that is running split-logfile
>How-To-Repeat:
telnet somewhere 80

GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: /
>Fix:
add the line
 if ($vhost =~ /\//) { $vhost="access" }
