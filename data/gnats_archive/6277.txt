From the docs:

"Note that there is no escaping performed on the strings from %r, %...i and %...o;
some with long memories may remember that I thought this was a bad idea, once upon a
time, and I'm still not comfortable with it, but it is difficult to see how to `do
the right thing' with all of `%..i', unless we URL-escape everything and break with CLF."

Is there any chance of reconsidering this? I agree that a general solution is difficult.
But I do think that some solution is now needed. It's becoming more and more common for
referrer query args in particular to include quotes. It really doesn't make for a
well-defined format for a field delimited with quotes to be allowed to include
quotes. Maybe at least filenames and referrers could be %nm-escaped? I'm not sure
that would really be breaking with CLF.
