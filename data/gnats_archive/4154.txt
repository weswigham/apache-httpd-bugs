>Environment:
win95a
>Description:
In win95 the auto-find IP address on startup does not work.  It might not on
NT either, as http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1658 seemed to mention the
same thing occurring.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Apache with the default (installation) configuration while either online
or offline: it tells you to set up servername no matter what.
Every time this thing catches me because it doesn't seem to say in httpd.conf
that it is necessary.
>Fix:
in httpd.conf uncomment #servername
and also make it say ServerName enter.your.host.name
so that users recognize it as something they should do, instead of optional.

State-Changed-Why:
This is microsoft's bogosity, the new .msi install packages
prompt the user for these answers.  Configuring your
machine name/domain properly in IP config helps too.
