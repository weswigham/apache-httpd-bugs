>Description:
As stated (probably not completely enough) in PR #4294, apxs is failing on some
OS's because it is not parsing arguments correctly.

apxs uses an extension of perl's "Getopts" routine to parse command line
arguments.  Around line 380, apxs tries to reformat -Wl options for the linker,
if it is not "gcc" (which IMHO may not be appropriate either; shouldn't it
check to see if it equals $CFG_CC _and_ $CFG_CC is a gcc-derived compiler?).

The "foreach" here:

    foreach $opt_Wl (@opt_W) {
                if($CFG_LD_SHLIB ne "gcc") {
                $opt .= " $1" if ($opt_Wl =~ m|^\s*l,(.*)$|);    
                } else {
                $opt .= " -W$opt_Wl";
                }
    }

is never executed, because "Getopts" stops parsing on the first command line
argument not beginning with a dash (-).  However, -L, -l, and -Wl options are
typically placed at the _end_ of the command line, after the object file names.

Insert a "print STDERR $cmd" debug line just before the "foreach" and this
problem should be quite obvious.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run on an OS such as NetBSD, or temporarily change CFG_LD_SHLIB to something
different from "gcc" ("echo" will suffice).  Then add a random -Wl,-foo option
after non-dash arguments and note that it isn't transformed into -foo.
>Fix:
Fix the included "Getopts" to parse options specified after non-option
arguments.  Remember, too, that many compilers accept options specified
at random places on the command line.
