apache
>Environment:
Windows NT/2000, Precompiled binaries from www.apache.org
>Description:
Using multiple JServ servlet engines with multiple Apaches on one machines does not work. The different invocations are completely different sets of files each in a directory of their own.
The message in the log file says something about a semaphore error on startup, the jserv servlet engine does not come up and so Apache won't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to start two independent apache servers with their own servlet engine each.
