n/a
>Description:
With 1.2b7 the struct module_struct {} has been extended with a new entry,
"header_parser", but this entry has not been added to any module other than
"mod_browser.c". This does not cause a serious problem since C defaults the
entry to NULL, but it is confusing.


It is also missing from the web documentation htdocs/manual/misc/API.html
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add the missing lines to the .c files and the HTML
