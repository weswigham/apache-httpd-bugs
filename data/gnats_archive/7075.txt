[Tue Jan 16 11:44:37 2001] [error] [client 158.36.126.225] Premature end of script headers: /home/bulent/www_docs/cgi-bin/Linker.cgi

yesterday the cgi worked before i did this:

I think the problem started when I compiled and installed PHP 4.0.2 yesterday

i added support for these two thing in apache config files
php did work later
shtml did also work

There are no error in the cgi script written in perl
It can also be run correctly under command line
And the server works fine but cgi
I have checked "everything" and i still cant find what the problem is

I have also read your FAQ according to SSI and CGI.


>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.khio.no/~bulent/cgi-bin/Linker.cgi

its a simple cgi in perl (just to test):

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

print "Content-type: text/html \n\n";

print "hello<br>\n";

another link to test:

>Fix:
i wish i had :)

maybe looking closer look at apache config files.
