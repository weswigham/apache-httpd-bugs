Linux rfclx1 2.0.29 #5 Mon Feb 2 15:44:12 PST 1998 i586
>Description:
Using Corel's Barista software, I generated a Java applet which displays graphics
using A Web browser.  This works fine when I load the applet from a local file on
a Unix machine.  But when I move all the necessary files over to the the Linux server
the Java applet will load all of it's requisite classes, but it refuses to display
the graphics in the browser.
>How-To-Repeat:
connect to http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov/local/mj_web/barista/1uperco2.htm
please do not make this address public, as this is not a public access address.
>Fix:
This applet will run from a DOS or Unix machine, but it does not operate correctly
when activated off of a Linux server.

State-Changed-Why:
First, 1.3b3 is ancient.  As we clearly say, we really can't
support old betas.  Upgrade to 1.3.1.

This is almost certainly a configuration error.  The
page in question can't be accessed from here, so I can't
tell you what is wrong.

Are you sure you have MIME types setup properly for all the
files involved?  If you load the graphics directly, do they
load?
