>Organization:
>Environment:
Solaris 2.7 with current recommended patches
Apache 1.3.14 compiled with gcc 2.8.1 (-O3 -fschedule-insns -pipe)
features enabled: suexec, mod_status, mod_info, mod_vhost_alias
>Description:
When mod_vhost_alias is used for mass virtual hosting, leaving
VirtualScriptAlias unset results in all accesses to anything in a virtual host
/cgi-bin/ being denied.  This differs from the behavior of regular virtual hosts
when ScriptAlias is unset, where instead /cgi-bin/ acts like any other
subdirectory.

Examining the code for mva_translate() in mod_vhost_alias.c shows that it always
attempts to handle /cgi-bin/ specially even if
conf->cgi_root_mode == VHOST_ALIAS_UNSET, resulting in those accesses being
denied in that case.
>How-To-Repeat:
Enable mod_vhost_alias in an Apache server.  Leave VirtualScriptAlias and
VirtualScriptAliasIP unset when configuring mass virtual hosting.  Configure a
mass virtual host that contains a cgi-bin directory under its document root, and
place a CGI program or document in it.  Attempt to access that CGI program or
document.  Compare the behavior with that of a regular VirtualHost when
ScriptAlias is unset and the virtual host contains a cgi-bin directory under its
document root.
>Fix:
I am testing the patch to mod_vhost_alias.c included below, which modifies the
mva_translate() function so that if VirtualScriptAlias is unset, URI
translation is done according to the VirtualDocumentRoot setting without special
handling of /cgi-bin/.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the patch. I have committed a different fix
because yours contained some errors (it looks like your
fix is based on 1.3.12 which has a bug). Thanks for using
Apache!
