>Environment:
Windows NT 4, Using MSVC++ version 5.0
>Description:
I have a virtual host www.example.com, with a UNC DirectoryRoot
(//machine/share). If I click on the "Last Modified" link on a directory
listing, I get an Application Error. Here is part of the backtrace:
  _expandtime()
  _Strftime()
  strftime()
strftime() is receiving NULL as the fourth argument (the const struct tm *
argument). As I'm having problems with creating a workspace for Apache, I'm
not sure what calls strftime().
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think the problem is with the way UNC paths are being handled. When I changed
the DirecotryRoot to C:\somedir, the "Last Modified" link worked fine.
