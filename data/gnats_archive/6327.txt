windows NT 4.0 SP 4.0
visual c++ version 6.0
>Description:
I'm using cgi-bin to drive a graphics application through an html form. The cgi 
script works fine when called from the command line. The cgi script fails when 
called by the Apache webserver. Debugging shows the  failure (hang) to occur at
the point where the graphics window need to be opened.

>How-To-Repeat:
I can send code if needed
>Fix:
Besides running on Unix, no!!

State-Changed-Why:

Please help narrow this down... are you successful running
from the command line and not from a service?  If you set
the Service Apache Startup options (from the control panel)
to "allow program to interact with desktop", does this help?
