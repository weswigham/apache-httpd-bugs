>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.4 sun4m
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
I have upgraded to 1.3b2 because I need the functionality of CIDR
and netmask suffixes in the allow directives of access.conf.

If I have a line such as "allow from 194.70.70.0/24" then accesses
from a machine in that Class C network are correctly granted, but if
I try the line "allow from 194.70.70." then accesses are denied with
a 403 response. A line allowing a single IP address also fails unless
I specify the network as well, i.e. "allow from 194.70.70.70/32"
instead of "allow from 194.70.70.70". If I specify a hostname instead,
e.g. "allow from panic.inta.net" then it does work as expected.
