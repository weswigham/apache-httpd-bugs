Using gcc.
>Description:
After a short while of running the server, it is evident that processes are hanging around indefinitely.  Kill -ALRM and Kill -USR2 do NOT work to kill these processes. 

server-status often looks like:
KKK_KK_KKKKKKKKKK_KKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.KKK_KKKKWKKKKKWKWKKKK__KKKK.KK
K..K.KKKK.K..K.WK.........K........K...K........................

And the "stuck" processes have very high SS:

-1 10328 0/4230/4251 _  39.99 98 12052 0.0 23.65 23.65  crtntx1-ar2-169-156.crtntx1.dsl xxxx.xxxx.net GET /perftest/text1.htm?1005325141989 HTTP/1.1 

The server will eventually refuse connections when it hits max clients.  I've read through similar reports w/Apache on Solaris and Linux, but found no resolution.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unsure.  I can repeat here by just letting the server run for a few hours.  This problem also happened in version 1.3.19 and I compiled 1.3.22 to hopefully fix it but to no avail.
>Fix:
No.  I've seen quick-fix patches suggesting sending USR2 instead of ALRM, but in my case, not even USR2 kills the process.  The only way I know to fix it is to turn keepalives off, or periodically restart the server, which both impact performance or stability, but at this point, is better than the server refusing connections.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Fri Nov  9 12:27:28 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

This is almost surely the result of some module or library
that is sucking up signals that apache needs to implement
the timeout.

Since we can be fairly certain that this is not caused
by a module included in the base distribution, there
is not much we can do.

It may help if you reply to this message with a list of
the modules and libraries that you are using.  At least
then people who have this problem in the future could
look for commonalities.

Sorry we can't help further.

 PHP 4.0.6 is the only module included outside the base distribution.
 
 PHP:
 ./configure  --with-apache=/opt/src/apache_1.3.22 --with-mysql=/opt/mysql
 --enable-magic-quotes --enable-track-vars --prefix=/opt/php --with-config-file-path=/opt/php/lib
 --with-ldap=/usr --with-snmp=/usr/local --with-mh
 ash=/usr/local --with-mcrypt=/usr/local --enable-ftp
 --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-pdflib=/usr/local --with-jpe
 g-dir=/usr/local --with-tiff-lib=/usr/lo cal --with-png-dir=/usr/local
 --with-gd=/usr/local
 
 Apache:
 ./configure \
 "--with-layout=Apache" \
 "--prefix=/opt/apache" \
 "--enable-module=most" \
 "--with-perl=/usr/local/bin" \
 "--activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a" \
 "$@"
