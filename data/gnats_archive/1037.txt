Irix 5.3, SGI Indy
>Description:
I have pages on the server owned by HTTPD_USER as well as by virtual hosts
via user/group directives. All pages have server side includes turned on, we
make extensive use of these. <!--#exec cmd="blabla arg"> works for HTPPD_USER
but not for owners of virtual domains.....suexec and cgis are functioning
correctly for other cgi's in virtual domains.
eg
   <!--#exec cmd="./getnews news" -->
cgi-log reports
   [10:42:33 22-08-97]: cannot stat program: (./getnews.cgi aus)
