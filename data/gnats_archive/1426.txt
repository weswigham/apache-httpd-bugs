>Description:
My original web server is called www2.kdl.com.hk and I am trying to
use VirtualHost to support another company called idris.com.
It seems like the DocumentRoot declared under VirtualHost overwrites
the srm.conf's DocumentRoot. Therefore, when I try to go to 
http://www2.kdl.com.hk/, I ended up getting into "idris.com" And my 
question is: Can I have different DocumentRoots, one for www2.kdl.com.hk 
and another one for idris.com ?

Include below is extracted from httpd.conf:
<VirtualHost idris.com>
ServerAdmin akwok@kdl.com.hk
DocumentRoot /usr/apache/htdocs/IDRIS
ServerName idris.com
ErrorLog logs/idris.com-error_log
TransferLog logs/idris.com-access_log
</VirtualHost>

And my srm.conf has set DocumentRoot to /usr/apache/htdocs
