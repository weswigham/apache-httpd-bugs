All Windows
>Description:
httpd.conf says:
# Apache parses all CGI scripts for the shebang line by default.
# This comment line, the first line of the script, consists of the symbols
# pound (#) and exclamation (!) followed by the path of the program that 
# can execute this specific script.  For a perl script, with perl.exe in
# the C:\Program Files\Perl directory, the shebang line should be:

   #!c:/program files/perl/perl
--cut---

This is bad bad advice.  Perl has bugs that prevent it from working properly when installed into a path with spaces on *ALL* platforms (linux, freebsd included).
