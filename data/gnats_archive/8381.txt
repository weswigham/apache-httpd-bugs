(Tried both the src-r2 and nosrc-r2 installs.)
>Description:
Installation completes properly. However, startup invariably fails. Configuration files generated by the installer look correct. I tried installing both the src-r2 and nosrc-r2 installs and got exactly the same result. error.log yields the following:

[Fri Sep 21 07:03:17 2001] [crit] (10045)The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced: Parent: WSADuplicateSocket failed for socket 368.
[Fri Sep 21 07:03:17 2001] [error] (9)Bad file descriptor: master_main: create child process failed. Exiting.
[Fri Sep 21 07:04:17 2001] [error] forcing termination of child #0 (handle 408)
>How-To-Repeat:
