Win NT 4.0 SP6
>Description:
This .htaccess file works fine on Linux running Apache 1.3.9 but fails using
the 1.3.12 Win32 binary from the apache.org site:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /test
RewriteRule ^index2\.html$ index.html

mod_rewrite appears to be adding the prefix twice.
I get the following with the RewriteLogLevel set to 9 under NT:

[per-dir e:/apache/htdocs/test/] strip per-dir prefix: e:/apache/htdocs/test/index2.html -> index2.html
[per-dir e:/apache/htdocs/test/] applying pattern '^index2\.html$' to uri 'index2.html'
[per-dir e:/apache/htdocs/test/] rewrite index2.html -> index.html
[per-dir e:/apache/htdocs/test/] add per-dir prefix: index.html -> e:/apache/htdocs/test/index.html
[per-dir e:/apache/htdocs/test/] add per-dir prefix: e:/apache/htdocs/test/index.html -> e:/apache/htdocs/test/e:/apache/htdocs/test/index.html
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
This section of code appears to be where the problem is since a 
full win32 path would not begin with a '/'. I was unclear about 
the reasons for implementing this logic so I went no further.

/*
 *   Again add the previously stripped per-directory location
 *   prefix if the new URI is not a new one for this
 *   location, i.e. if it's not starting with either a slash
 *   or a fully qualified URL scheme.
 */
i = strlen(r->filename);
if (   prefixstrip
    && !(   r->filename[0] == '/'
         || (   (i > 7 && strncasecmp(r->filename, "http://",   7) == 0)
             || (i > 8 && strncasecmp(r->filename, "https://",  8) == 0)
             || (i > 9 && strncasecmp(r->filename, "gopher://", 9) == 0)
             || (i > 6 && strncasecmp(r->filename, "ftp://",    6) == 0)
             || (i > 5 && strncasecmp(r->filename, "ldap:",     5) == 0)
             || (i > 5 && strncasecmp(r->filename, "news:",     5) == 0)
             || (i > 7 && strncasecmp(r->filename, "mailto:",   7) == 0)))) {
    rewritelog(r, 3, "[per-dir %s] add per-dir prefix: %s -> %s%s",
               perdir, r->filename, perdir, r->filename);
    r->filename = ap_pstrcat(r->pool, perdir, r->filename, NULL);
