We installed the Apache_1_3_4_win32.exe, then we installed the Apache_JServ_1_obj1.exe and restart the pc. During the restart a message error appeared: 
"The procedure entry point_ap_pclosesocket@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library ApacheCore.dll"
After that the apache server could'nt start.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 15 08:23:30 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Please search the bugdb for previous reports of the same bug
before submitting a report.  This problem is due to the fact that
jserv is complied for 1.3.3, not 1.3.4.  It has to be recompiled
for 1.3.4 due to shortcomings in the way DLLs work.
