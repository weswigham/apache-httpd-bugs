>Description:
I tried using your web site to download the apache distributions (I tried all release 3).  The .gz distributions are all raw tar files (the .gz should not be there) and I could not retrieve any .Z file.  I got file not found.

I have been able to get the files from a mirror server, I just thought you would want to know that there are problems in the dist directory of www.apache.org.

No response is necessary.
>How-To-Repeat:
www.apache.com/dist/apache_1.3.4.tar.gz
>Fix:
Fix the files.

State-Changed-Why:
The files are just fine.  You may be using a broken browser
that doesn't properly handle content-encodings (eg. some versions
of Navigator and IE) and that automatically uncompresses them
without properly changing the name.
