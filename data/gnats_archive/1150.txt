>Description:
I was wondering if Apache supports Unicode or Unicode fonts. This standard
allows people to communicate in any of the written lagauages around the world
and makes sure a Chinese doucument in France looks the same as the the creator
saw it in Hong Kong. If Apache doesn't support Unicode will it be addded?

State-Changed-Why:
Except for mod_include, there really shouldn't be any reason
Apache doesn't support unicode.  Have you tried and not succeeded
at something?

State-Changed-Why:
To repeat the question, have you tried using Apache with
Unicode and had problems?  If not, what makes you think
it isn't supported?
