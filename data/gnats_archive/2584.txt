>Environment:
SunOS sauron 5.5.1 Generic_103640-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
Server Version: Apache/1.3.1-dev (Unix) mod_perl/1.12_01-dev
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
I'm not really sure whats going on here.  I recently upgraded to 1.3.1-dev and started getting
these in the error log:
[warn] handler "cgi-wrapper" not found for

I have this in my httpd.conf file:

# To use cgiwrap for CGI scripts:
AddHandler cgi-wrapper .cgw
Action cgi-wrapper /cgi-bin/cgiwrap2/

The script runs seemingly without problems.

I looked through the changes and noticed a reference to PR#2529 which seems to have 
introduced this error message.  I'm thinking that the message is bogus since the handler seems
to actually be being called.

State-Changed-Why:
Can your reproduce them on any access to a .cgw script, or is
it just certain ones?  Can your reproduce them yourself
at all or are they just in the logs?

I can't reproduce it myself, so perhaps there is some other
condition necessary?  Can you try on a test server
without any extra modules (eg. no mod_perl) compiled in?

 It happens for any of the .cgw scripts that I run.  I'll compile a
 server this afternoon without mod_perl and see how it reacts.
