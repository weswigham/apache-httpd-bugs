>Description:
There are quotes missing from $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB variable in apxs perl
script. Currently the configuration systems sets it to:
	my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = '-shared -expect_unresolved * -msym -s';
...but it should definitely be:
	my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = '-shared -expect_unresolved \'*\' -msym -s';
...as the asterisk here isn't meant to be a shell filename glob. It should
be passed "as-is" to the ld command. OSF ld manual page also warns that
the wildcard characters afer "-expect_unresolved" need to be quoted from shell.
Apxs uses the perl system() function with a single string argument, which means 
that the command is passed through the shell and expanded.
>How-To-Repeat:
/tmp/jserv0.9.11 $ /usr/local/apache/sbin/apxs -c mod_jserv.c 
cc -DOSF1 -DSTATUS -DUSE_HSREGEX -DSHARED_MODULE -I/usr/local/apache/include  -c mod_jserv.c
ld -shared -expect_unresolved * -msym -s -o mod_jserv.so mod_jserv.o
ld:
Object file format error in: INSTALL: read_cur_obj_info: bad file magic number(0x6854)
apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=65536
/tmp/jserv0.9.11 $ 
>Fix:
I tried adding the quotes (and some backslashes in front of them) in the relevant
location in src/Configure, but no success. Probably because I don't know
Apache Configure system too well. As a temporary work-around I edited 
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apxs script manually.

 I did some more debugging of the problem, and found out a simple fix:
 
 --- apxs.pl.dist	Tue Jun 16 12:37:32 1998
 +++ apxs.pl	Tue Jun 16 12:37:47 1998

      my (@cmds) = @_;
      my ($cmd, $rc);
  
      foreach $cmd (@cmds) {
          print STDERR "$cmd\n";
 -        $rc = system("$cmd");
 +        $rc = system(split(' ', $cmd));
          if ($rc != 0) {
              printf(STDERR "apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=%d\n", $rc << 8);
              exit(1);
          }
      }
 
 ...although I don't know if this breaks apxs on some other platforms,
 but I assume that apxs commands don't have to be passed throuhg /bin/sh in
 any situation. (BTW, why was the system() argument string $cmd surrounded
 with the double-quotes anyway? :-)
