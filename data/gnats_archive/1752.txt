>Description:
I know your page said nothing about cgi's, but this is not about programming them. 
in the srm.conf I have made sure the addhandeler line with .cgi is commented out,
but users on my system can simply put .cgi as a file and they can execute cgi's
with the webservers permissions. I have installed cgiwrap, and it works well. But
there is a problem that users dont have to go though the wrapper, if they put .cgi.
Is there somewhere in the source that .cgi is enabled my default? How can I turn it 
off, and still let certain users ue cgui through the wrapper?
>How-To-Repeat:
www.cheapnet.net/~mike/cgi-bin/wwwlog.pl <- normal file I want to go throught the 
wrapper at like: www.cheapnet.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~mike/wwwlog.pl

BUT if a user did something like www.cheapnet.net/~mike/cgi-bin/wwwlog.cgi they can
get through without using the wrapper!?
>Fix:
Turn .cgi off by default in the source, it that is the way it is setup right now..

State-Changed-Why:
Apache does not magically execute files named with .cgi
extensions as CGIs.  It has to be configured to do so;
somewhere, you have that configured.

Either the scripts are in a ScriptAliased directory, or
you setup handling for them in one of your *.conf files
or the user has a .htaccess file somewhere in their
document tree (or above it) to enable them.

 No you did not say that.  You need to check again because Apache doesn't
 magically execute anything.  It is nearly certain that this is a
 configuration problem.
 
 _ALL_ you mentioned is that you didn't have an AddHandler in your config
 files.
 
 Have you checked every directory up to and including the user's cgi-bin
 directory (eg. /.htaccess, all the way to .htaccess in the directory the
 script is in) to be sure there is no htaccess file that enables it?
 
 Look through the source yourself to try to find where Apache executes all
 files named .cgi; you won't find it because it isn't there.  grep for cgi
 in all your config files, be sure you are using the right set of config
 files, and triple check for htaccess files.

 It turned out to be in the mime.types NOT a *.conf file. Thanks for the help anyway...
