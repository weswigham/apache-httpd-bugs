>Description:
i try to configure my Apache server with Proxy module mod_proxy:

ProxyRequests on
ProxyPass /test/ https://<dns name>:443/

but i cannot, https:/<my apache>:<ssl port>/ is

getting "Http 403 Forbidden You don'have permission to access / on this server"

>How-To-Repeat:
do the same ProxyPass test
>Fix:
is it comming from my proxy module?

is it comming from my compilation?

is it comming from sources of mod_proxy?

is it possible to modify it to get a good result with my Apache server?

i want to stay with Apache-ssl, 

i do want "Apache mod_ssl with EAPI" cause my Web Agent (mod_sm.so) doesn't be stable with mod_sm.so
