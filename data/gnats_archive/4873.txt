>Description:
i just downloaded apache last night and like the options, etc, however 
I think it would be really good if it ran in the system tray (less clutter on 
the taskbar) and also allow a cleaner exit when the machine is normally shut 
down.  i.e. a user would not have to shut down the web server before shutting 
down windows.  just a suggestion.  thanks!
