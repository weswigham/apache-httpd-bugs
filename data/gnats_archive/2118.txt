>Release:        1.3b6
>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 (build 1381), running on Pentium 120 w/64MB memory
and not enough disk space.
>Description:
Installing 1.3b6 over 1.3b3 on NT nuked my srm.conf, httpd.conf and access.conf.
This was a pain.  I have to support both my new domain name and the old 
domain name, I'd made lots of changes to all these files.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the apache.1.3b6.1.exe; go through the installshield procedure.  Install over
an _existing_ (1.3b3) apache installation which has httpd.conf, srm.conf and 
access.conf to which you have made extensive modifications and no backups.  At the
end of the installation, you will find that your modifications have evaporated.
>Fix:
Sure.  _Either_ detect existing files and do not overwrite them, _or_ back
them up someway.  At the very least warn us!  I didn't bother to back up my
files because ``The Apache guys know what they're doing.  They won't nuke
my files.''  Mostly, I'm right;-%2

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the note, and sorry about clobbering your files.
We have committed a fix to the current CVS tree that preserves
.conf files if they already exist; and when installing the 
docs it doesn't overwrite the index.html that might be there,
though it will update your installed manual. See:
