Linux Red Hat 6.2
>Description:
i've successfully set up the web server with no errors or sort.
I've ported several virtual hosts from my previous version (1.3.11).
Httpd is started and running from user nobody, group nobody;
the web pages belongging to user root and group root; with access level 755.
And all these web pages are located in a different directory (/web/html) -
belonging to user root, group root as well.
But when i type http://<domain name> from the browser, this is the message returned :

Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.


Please help, this is desperate case.
