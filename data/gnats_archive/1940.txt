>Description:
PR#1072 and PR#1893 seems to address the same problem. But do not come up with a solution.

I restart httpd every minute if less than 5 servers are running.

/var/log/messages contains a lot of:
Warning: possible SYN flood from ...

grep -B 5 configured /var/log/httpd/error_log gives:

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
It would be nice to have httpd print some debug info. Especially concerning
spawning processes

[Feedback from submitter]
It seems that the problem of dying httpds on RedHat 5.0 is solved by:

  Upgrade to glibc-{devel-}2.0.7-4
  Recompile apache (rpm --rebuild ...)

In other words: The bug is/was in glibc.

The server has now been up for 30 hours. Before the compile, the server
would die after max 6 hours.
