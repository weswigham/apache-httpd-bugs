 Thanks.  I've seen the fix happened on 
 httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/ssi.htm
 but as I've mentioned in the main text of my bug report, 
 it appears also in
 http://www.apache.org/docs-2.0/howto/ssi.html
 
   Best Regards,
   Kohei

 I'm not sure how you even found that URL.  It really shouldn't be used for
 anything.  All links should point to the httpd.apache.org site.
 
 In any case, thanks for the report.  The www site will be updated at
 some point in the future.
 
 Joshua.

   Easy.  Just do a search from the main www.apache.org page (with "server
 side includes" as the key).
   Am I reporting another bug here?
