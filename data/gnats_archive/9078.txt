Debian Linux 2.2.18 #2 SMP Tue Jan 23 19:07:25 GMT 2001 i686
>Description:
With a valid .htaccess file in one of the subdirectories of a virtual site's document root, no-one can access the directory or the documents in it. The .htaccess file contains no tab characters - all spaces. NB users are being authenticated using the PAM authentication module to an NT domain logon server. The .htpasswd file appears not to be accessed at all, which I verified by adding a user to it who isn't in the NT domain.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is the content of the .htaccess file.

AuthPAM_Enabled on
AuthPAM_FallThrough on
AuthUserFile /home/deja/data/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /home/deja/data/.htgroup
AuthName "Logica Username/Password"
AuthType Basic
require group srdtech
>Fix:
My workaround for the moment has been to replace the last line with

require user w x y z

(where w x y z are valid NT users). This isn't a satisfactory procedure in the long term.

State-Changed-Why:

You are clearly using a third-party module for your
authentication.  In all likelihood, it is this module
that is causing your problems, so we can't do anything
to help you.

Thanks for using Apache!
