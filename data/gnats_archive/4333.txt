Using binary distribution for Win32...apache 1.3.6 on a Windows 95 machine
>Description:
I am getting the following error message:

 (2) No such file or directory: ISAPI GetExtensionVersion() failed:

  This is followed by the correct path to my .dll file.
  I added the handler isapi-isa for dlls. I don't have the source for the 
  associated handler module but I'm wondering if it will work with a .dll 
  written in object pascal (using delphi4.0)?
  We are hoping to avoid a switch to the evil empires NT and IIS server 
  but I must show this will work by the end of this week. No choice with
  using Delphi code I'm afraid. The ISAPI example I am using is Isapidem.dll
  from Cantu's..Mastering Delphi 4. Works fine for them using IIS. 
  I'd be very grateful for any definitive answer you can give me.
