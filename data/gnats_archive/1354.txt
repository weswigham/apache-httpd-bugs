I'm running gcc 2.7..2.2, on a standard Slackware 95 installation of Linux.
>Description:
When apache was configured for inetd mode, it would produce no output and no log files.  I found no core, and no signal.

I added many syslog calls to find that in:src/main/http_main.c, in the function 

unsigned int set_callback_and_alarm(void (*fn) (int), int x)

the program would apparently cause a segmentaion violation, in this block:

    old = scoreboard_image->servers[my_child_num].timeout_len;
    scoreboard_image->servers[my_child_num].timeout_len = x;
    ++scoreboard_image->servers[my_child_num].cur_vtime;

Nothing is output, and the ports are closed.

I assumed (and did not check!) that the problem is that standalone_main dosen't   initalize the my_chuld and/or scoreboard_image data correctly.

For my usage, I just uncommented the OPTIMIZE_TIMEOUTS definition, and that worked fine, but that's not going to work for the main distribution, is it?
>How-To-Repeat:
Build so that the OPTIMIZE_TIMEOUTS constant is defined, and run in inetd mode, connecting to the server.
>Fix:
Either check the standalone flag and just use signals, or make sure the scoreboard table is initalized.  I didn't diagnose what was wrong with the scoreboard table, if it was not initalized, or my_child_num wasn't right or what
