>Description:
The .htaccess file, appears to not be read more than two subdirectories.  
For example:
  http://www.foo.com/students/2001/.htaccess
    -here I have Error Documents
  http://www.foo.com/students/2001/public_html/.htaccess
    -here I have a allow from none
    -when viewed from web I get a forbidden CUSTOM error message
  http://www.foo.com/students/2001/public_html/cgi-bin/
    -when viewed from web I get a forbidden CUSTOM error message
  http://www.foo.com/students/2001/public_html/cgi-bin/Dev/
    -when viewed from web I get a forbidden STANDARD error message
As seen from the non standard error message, the htaccess file seems not to
be read.
>How-To-Repeat:
Repeat the directory structure as I have denoted in the full description area.

 What do you mean n/a!?!  How the heck can we help you if you don't even
 say what platform you are running on?

 Found the problem. If a directory is chmod'd to 700  rather than 755, then
 the non customizable error message is displayed.
 
 chmod 755 - _custom_ forbidden error message
 chmod 700 - _standard_ forbidden error message
