After configure/make/make install....
# ../sbin/apachectl start
Syntax error on line 24 of /home/apache/etc/access.conf:
Expected </Directory> but saw </Directory>
../sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started 

I can remove the access.conf file completly, server runs.
Using IBM's cc for aix 4.3 to compile.
Tried editing file, no help.
Tried removing entry, next </Directory> entry caused same error.
TIA, EDHARRIS@uab.edu
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile aix4.1 dist on aix 4.3 with ibm c compiler
>Fix:
Yes, but I have to have security!!
(remove access.conf)

 Hi!
 I included a text lising, and the orig file as an attachment.
 I copied the 1.3.0 access.conf file from my linux 2.0.30 system, it
 gives the same error under aix 4.3 on PPC604e Quad CPU system.

Comment-Added:
The AIX compiler problem which gave the error of
"on Expected </Files> but saw </Files>"  has been fixed.
+  A set of PTF's which correct the problem are available from:
+  http://service.software.ibm.com/support/rs6000
+  The PTF's are:  U462005, U462006, U462007, and U462023 through
+  U462030.  The PTF's have been tested and do indeed fix the problem.

Thanks for using Apache
