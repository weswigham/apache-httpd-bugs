We need a little more information.. such as what the exact
SSI directive is and in which directory the SSI document
lives.  Did this work in earlier versions?

 The SSI directive is:
     <!--#include file="./motd"-->
 
 The .shtml file containing the directive and the target file are in the same (htdocs)
 directory.  This setup works okay on Apache 1.2 running on HP-UX 10.20, but
 when I copied our Intranet structure to my home (NT4) PC for my convenience in
 updating it after installing 1.3.6, I ran across this problem.  On the HP, motd is
 actually a symlink to /etc/motd, but on the PC it's just a text file.
 
 I'll be updating the HP-UX Apache installation, soon, so I can see if this problem
 exists in the newer version on the HP.

Comment-Added:

Please try using "include virtual" instead of "include file"
and see if the problem goes away.

 Yes, "#include virtual ./motd" works, as one would expect.  I see that the
 mod_include doc recommends 'virtual' over 'file'.
 
 Could you point me to web docs which more fully explain SSI than does the
 mod_include doc with Apache?  Specifically, any Standards documentation?
 And more particularly, why 'virtual' is preferred over 'file'?
 
 Regards,
 Doug
