When NN downloads files of *.cob type, the file size is changed.
This doesn't happen with IE. Changing the filename to *.xyz removed the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a link to a file xyz.cob and try to download it using NN.

State-Changed-Why:

IE is always wrong.  It ignores the content-type field,
meaning you nearly never get the right result.

Ask NN for the doucment properties, and look at the content
type.  You are likely _not_ getting and octet-stream header
so NN is converting lf's to crlf's.

Please read up on the AddType family of directives.  This
forum is for bug reports only [IE's bug, in this case], not
troubshooting configuration errors.
