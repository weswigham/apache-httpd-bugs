>Description:
The current possibilities of setting the Last-modified header for documents that use the Server Side Include option is not enough.
In my opinion it should have two more possibilities.

The current ones are:

 1. Don't set the Last-modified header

 2. Set it to the date/time of the main document

I suggest you add two more:

 3. Set it to the current date/time each time a page is requested.

 4. Set it to the most current date/time based on the knowledge of all documents. Main document and all included document(s).

The concept is above. Unfortunatly I am not a programmer so I can't help you with any source code.
