The site www.teamits.com is running Rapidsite/Apa-1.3.14 (Unix) FrontPage/4.0.4.3 mod_ssl/2.7.1 OpenSSL/0.9.6 on IRIX

The site www.srtware.com is running mod_jk FrontPage/4.0.4.3 Confluence Apache/1.3.19 Ben-SSL/1.42 (Unix) on FreeBSD.
>Description:
It seems that if a browser requests a non-existent .php file,
the server returns an "internal server error" rather than a 404 error. 
I have duplicated this on multiple web servers.

Non-existent .php3 files are slightly different, they return:

Fatal error: Unable to open /u/web/teamit/test.php3 in - on line 0
No input file specified. 

It seems like Apache is handing the .php request to the php module
before checking to see if the file even exists...?

Answer from RapidSite technical support:
----
This is because the handler gets precedence over the existence of the actual file. The handler sees the .php3 and then tries to parse the code. As far as Apache's concerned, the file existed - it returns a 200 result code because the handler was called successfully. 

If we were running PHP as an Apache module, this would likely be different, but we're not.

>Fix:
Have Apache check for the existence of a file before calling the CGI handler for PHP.

State-Changed-When: Sun Nov 11 12:23:35 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This is the way the appropriate directives work on purpose (although you didn't say just how you had PHP configured to run), since it is possible to create a virtual URL space.  The PHP module is the one deciding how to handle requests for nonexisting files.
