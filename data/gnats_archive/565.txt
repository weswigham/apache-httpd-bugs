>Description:
I was trying to password a given directory on my server, which I've done plenty of times before on other apache servers. When I try to do so, however, I get a server error, and the following in the error_log:

[Fri May  9 13:19:24 1997] access to /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/test failed for mac10.brownmc.com, reason: mSQL: Missing parameters for password lookup: Password table

I specifically didn't include mon_auth_msql when I compiled, because I was having the same error with the 1.1.0 binary I downloaded a month or so ago.

I thought maybe "AuthAuthoritative off" in the .htaccess file might take care of it, but then I'd get "invalid command AuthAuthoritative" in the error log.

Here's my current .htaccess file, if it helps:

AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/passfile
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName bmci
AuthType Basic

<limit get>
require user greg
require user jon
require user bq
</limit>

I have no idea, sorry.

 Are you sure you don't have the MSQL module compiled in?  Double
 check your Configuration file to be _sure_ it is commented out,
 rerun Configure, rebuild the binary and double check that you
 are running the right binary.
