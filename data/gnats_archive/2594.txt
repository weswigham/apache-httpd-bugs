>Release:        JServ 0.9.11/Apache 1.3.0
>Environment:
Any OS, problem in Java code
>Description:
The output stream should be closed after processing the jhtml
file in JServSSI.doGet(). Otherwise all output may not be sent
to the client.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try a jhtml page with a couple of <SERVLET> calls to Servlets that do
not close the stream.
>Fix:
Adding the line
  res.getOuputStream().close();
at the end of JServSSI.doGet() fixes this.

State-Changed-Why:
This is fixed in the latest version of JServSSI.  You can
get this with the latest snapshot of the JServ source tree
(the 0.9.x tree is no longer in development); the snapshots
are available from http://java.working-dogs.com/daily/

This bug will be marked closed when a checkpointed version
of the 1.0b development tree is released, unless we hear
that this is still a problem.

Thanks for the bug reports!
