>Environment:
RedHat Linux (Release 4, linux kernel 2.0.18 on i686)
>Description:
When httpd 1.1.3 is run fromthe command line with in the format
"httpd -f /www/conf/httpd.conf" (my config location), page accesses are
4-5 times faster than when run from my rc script, which simply calls it as
compiled, which also uses /www//conf/httpd.conf.  The actual speed of transfer
seems to be fine, it is the delay between the GET request and the data flow
commencing where the problem occurs.
>How-To-Repeat:
I unfortunately have defaulted to using the command line start method
at the moment, but I would be happy to work through this situation on
request.
>Fix:
Well, the command line method is ugly, but it works.  I feel that there should be a better
way of going about this

State-Changed-When: Sun Mar 30 07:12:26 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The configuration files are read in once during startup,
and then not referenced again until a reload is requested.
How they are located should have no impact on server
performance once they have been loaded.  Can you confirm
that you are still seeing this problem, it is reproducible,
and that it isn't a process priority issue?
