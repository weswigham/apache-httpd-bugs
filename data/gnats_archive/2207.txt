The server starts and responds fine, but the error log grows until the disk is full.
the exact message I get is:

[warn] (2)No such file or directory: select claimed we could write, but in fact we couldn't. This is a bug in Windows.

How can I fix the problem, or can I turn the log off completely.

State-Changed-Why:
Complain to Microsoft and tell them to fix their broken
kernel.  It is a bug in Windows.  We have to kludge around
it in an inefficient way.  The warning will probably be
removed or changed to a debug level in 1.3.0, but for
now you could stop it (and other things) being
logged by changing your LogLevel I guess.

Comment-Added:
The logging level for this error has been moved to "DEBUG".
It's not a fatal error, and there's nothing the admin really
can do about it.

 Hi. This is the qmail-send program at hyperreal.org.

 This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

 Sorry, I couldn't find any host by that name. (#4.1.2)
 I'm not going to try again; this message has been in the queue too long.
