>Environment:
Windows 98
>Description:
Apache is giving a 404 error for files over 70 megs or so in aliased directories such as http://myserver/MusicVideos/

The auto-indexing sees the files, but when I click them, it'll say "file not found"

If I put the files in the htdocs folder, they're downloadable
>How-To-Repeat:
I'd say just try making an aliased directory with the Alias directive, and putting a 75-100 meg file into it, and seeing if it downloads or not..  I dunno if this problem is win98, apache 1.3.23, or fat32 specific, though
