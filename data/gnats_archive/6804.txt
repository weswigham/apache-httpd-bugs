>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Red Hat Linux V 6.2 w/ kernel 2.2.13 (this bug would exist on all platforms where mod_rewrite works).
>Description:
I had a rule:

  RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://www.xyz.com/$1 [P,L]

And desperately needed that to act on certain server-side include directives. Woefully, mod_rewrite.c explicitly disallows this, as an SSI is technically a subrequest.

Is there any real reason that an SSI should not be proxied, or was this an oversight in mod_rewrite? I really need this functionality, and would rather not continue to maintain my own hacked version of mod_rewrite....
