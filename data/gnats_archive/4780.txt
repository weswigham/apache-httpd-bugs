>Description:
I have a problem running mod_perl 1.16 on Apache 1.3.6

Here's the situation:
Whenever I try to start Apache either as a service or as a console
I get the following message:
"The procedure entry point_ap_table_add@12 clould not
be located in the dynamic link library ApacheCore.dll"

After a few seconds(minutes!?) I get another error message:
"Error 2186:\\(mydomain here) the service is not responding
to the control function."

What's the problem?

The mod_perl readme file sais:
"Perl 5.005_05 (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz)"
Well, I've downloaded Perl from this location ... its version is
5.005_03 NOT 5.005_05, I do not know if this is a problem?!


here's the loadmodule part of my httpd.conf :
LoadModule anon_auth_module modules/ApacheModuleAuthAnon.dll
LoadModule cern_meta_module modules/ApacheModuleCERNMeta.dll
LoadModule digest_module modules/ApacheModuleDigest.dll
LoadModule expires_module modules/ApacheModuleExpires.dll
LoadModule headers_module modules/ApacheModuleHeaders.dll
LoadModule proxy_module modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/ApacheModuleRewrite.dll
LoadModule speling_module modules/ApacheModuleSpeling.dll
LoadModule status_module modules/ApacheModuleStatus.dll
LoadModule usertrack_module modules/ApacheModuleUserTrack.dll
LoadModule perl_module modules/ApacheModulePerl.dll

If I comment out the last line it works!?

Please help.
Thank you!

        Sincerely,
	Alexander
