>Description:
If someones uses (by mistake) something like this:

 <!--#exec cmd="/path/to/dir"-->

the following entry appears in the error_log:

"/bin/sh: /path/to/dir: is a directory"

Without a leading date-entry and without a clue what
include the invalid CGI reference contains.

This also happens if the command is not executable (due
to permissions).

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Use stat on the supplied command-path and check permisions
before calling /bin/sh

State-Changed-Why:
Improved error logging is coming to Apache; that should 
address your concern regarding trying to track down the
source of that entry in the error log.  

Regarding checking what's passed to "cmd" by stat()'ing the
file or something, that's tricky because /bin/sh can do many
things with what's passed it on a command line; shell aliases 
are only one example.  

Thanks for your report!
