>Description:
.initArgs properties files are broken under Windows, because
JServServletManager.java uses File.separatorChar to name the file
as a resource, but resources should always be named with a forward
slash ('/') char, regardless of platform. [See 
http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/resources/resources.html]
>How-To-Repeat:
 
>Fix:
Replace File.separatorChar with '/' in the following code.

---

// Try to load a property file classname.initArgs
try {
   InputStream argsIn =
      loader.getResourceAsStream(classname.replace('.', 
                                 File.separatorChar) + ".initArgs");
   if (argsIn != null) {
      try {
          initargs.load(new BufferedInputStream(argsIn));
      } finally {
          argsIn.close();
      }
   }
} catch(IOException ignored) {}
