>Description:
I contacted the website with this problem, but they refused to help.  They are running Apache/1.3.6.  Any visit to this page is not cached (images only, html files seems to stay) no matter what, using IE5.0.  Now you might say I have something configured wrong, but I have tried this on at least 15 diffrent machines and OS's (win95,98,NT4) that all have a problem with this page when using IE5.0.  And yes, the cache is activated and has free space.  All other pages work fine.

My question is...  Is there any way an Apache server can be made to force a browser to refresh image files or not store them period?  The webmaster of the site says they are doing nothing wrong.  But I don't know if I buy that.

Could they be doing something wrong?  I've never seen a site do this before.

http://www.homepage.com

or any "homepage.com" website i.e. http://jpf.homepage.com
>Fix:
No.  It has to be a problem on the server side, why else whould only this one page out of 200 exibit this problem.  I'm sorry if I am misusing this "bug report" service, but I saw no other way to contact you.  Thank you for your time.
