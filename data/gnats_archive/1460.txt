>Description:
The number of segment depends on serial number of attemp to start apache 
server.
I use port 2080 (not 80)
When I type top , I can see only one httpd process runnig.
I am not sure, is Apache good started or not.
So. I suppose that error is not so serios.
>How-To-Repeat:
I am not sure, how you can repeat that problem. Maybe, it depends on machine 
that you use.
