Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) mod_macro/1.1.1 and a patched mod_autoindex, but the bug 
also occurs without the patch. There are also no macros involved in the 
configuration parts mentioned below.
>Description:
I've got the following error documents configured:

ErrorDocument 401 /error/Unauth
ErrorDocument 403 /error/Forbidden
ErrorDocument 404 /error/NotFound
ErrorDocument 410 /error/Gone
ErrorDocument 500 /error/ServerError

Alias /error/ "/home/HTTP/WWW/ErrorTemplates/"

<Directory "/home/HTTP/WWW/ErrorTemplates">
	Options FollowSymLinks Includes Multiviews -Indexes
	AddHandler server-parsed .html
	AllowOverride None
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
</Directory>

The directory /home/HTTP/WWW/ErrorTemplates/ contains beneath other files:

Forbidden.de.html Forbidden.en.html Gone.de.html Gone.en.html
NotFound.de.html NotFound.en.html ServerError.de.html
ServerError.en.html Unauth.de.html Unauth.en.html

They *all* contain the following SSI include statements:

<!--#include file="top.de.html" -->
<!--#include file="contact.de.html" -->
<!--#include file="bottom.de.html" -->

respective

<!--#include file="top.en.html" -->
<!--#include file="contact.en.html" -->
<!--#include file="bottom.en.html" -->

and they all work fine except Gone.{de,en}.html, there I get always an
empty document (also no headers no status line, etc) and a line
containing "[notice] child pid <pid> exit signal Segmentation fault
(11)" in the error log file. When commenting out the above mentioned
lines (by replacing "<!--#" with "<!-- #"), everything works fine
(except that the commented includes do not work :-).

So I tried configuring

ErrorDocument 410 /error/NotFound
ErrorDocument 404 /error/Gone

which resulted in 404s working and showing Gone.{de,en}.html and 410s
still not working. So this error is *not* caused by the documents
itself, but by something weird, which must have to do something with
the 410 code in mod_alias and server-parsed documents.

[BTW: There was no core dump.]

 Further debugging revealed, that the bug appeared not only with 410,
 but also with every other 4xx error triggered by a Redirect directive
 in the server configuration.
 
 The problem disappeared, after switching on the RewriteEngine for the
 appropriate VHost, although it was no RewriteRule, which triggered
 those failing 4xx error pages, but some RewriteRules may be indirectly
 involved in those requests and then being discarded by some
 RewriteCond.
