>Description:
The string comparison in http_core.c in "end_nested_section" that look like:
"cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token"

does not work under AIX.  When replaced with a strcmp everything works.
The error one gets when trying to start apache is:
"Expected </Directory> but saw </Directory>"


Apache is built with

./configure --enable-shared=max --prefix=/path
make
make install

Building apache is no problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to build and run apache on AIX with standard C compilers.
>Fix:
Using strcmp works, maybe there should be a fallback to it somehow!?
