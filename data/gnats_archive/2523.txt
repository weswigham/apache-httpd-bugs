State-Changed-Why:
I am not going to waste time making connexions between
unrelated bits of email from people who can't read the
bloody directions.  I have no idea what PR this was
supposed to be regarding, and I'm not going to spend time
trying to find out.

Additional Notes.

I also discovered this problem on Irix 5.3 running apache 1.3.0

I rebuilt the proxy server using the configurations suggested. When using
the:

EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 
Apache refused to start up and complained with the following in error_log

open: No such file or directory Cannot open lock file: 
/usr/local/apach-proxy/var/run/httpd.lock.441 
open: No such file or directory Cannot open lock file:
/usr/local/apach-proxy/var/run/httpd.lock.465 
open: No such file or directory Cannot open lock file:
/usr/local/apach-proxy/var/run/httpd.lock.494
  

When using the flags

EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DUSE_USLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

Apache loops hard and is unusable.
