SunOS big1 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
>Description:
About 1% of the time, the acess_log file contains the values "200 -"
for the status code and byte range. This seems normal with a status 302,
but I think a status 200 should have a byte field. At the same time, it seems
that the server actually FAILS to write or return the content of the page.
This ocurrs with a variety of pages and for a variety of browsers running 
HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
>How-To-Repeat:
Intermittent.
>Fix:
Nope.

State-Changed-Why:
Intermittant write failures are the nature of the Internet.
Every time I've seen a "200 -" from a connection it's been 
that the client had disconnected before it received its first
packet in response.  If you can show a situation where Apache
should have been delivering a page, where the client was there
waiting for it, and why that didn't happen, then we have 
something to work from.  Right now, a "200 -" is OK to mean
that the response was a 200, but the client didn't get any
data.
