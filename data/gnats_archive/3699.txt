>Description:
The httpd starts and then will not serve pages, indecies, etc.

The error_log shows several hudered error messages that read as follows:

httpd: [sat jan 16 11:51:38 99] [error] (-2147459072)bad file descriptor. accept (client socket)

The error_log blew up to about 23 meg (all this error) in about 1 hour.
>How-To-Repeat:
Downloaded apache 1.3.4 (the tar.gz)
Uncompressed it.
./configure (with no additional switched)
make

set up the httpd.conf file with the correct paths. and server names, no other modifications, httpd resides in /usr/local/apache

httpd (at the terminal prompt) and the server starts with no errors.

State-Changed-Why:
That looks like random stack corruption by something... you're
going to have to ask for help in a BeOS newsgroup I think though.
If you do find out something wrong with apache be sure to
report it.

Thanks
