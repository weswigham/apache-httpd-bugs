>Description:
There seems to be a problem with Netscape Navigator 4.0 and the acrobat
plugin when trying to view a byte served file.   The first page will
download correctly, but when you try to get the next page, the plugin
and navigator lock up.

Navigator 3.0 has no problems with byteserved PDF files. (works great, BTW)
I know that you look for certain headers from Netscape since they do 
ranges in a non-standard way.  Maybe with 4.0 they changed the headers??


>How-To-Repeat:
Try byte serving a PDF to Navigator 4.0
>Fix:
Look at the headers from 4.0?%3

State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 20 14:08:45 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The solution is to upgrade the Acrobat reader to version 3.01.
Prior to 3.01 the reader did not properly implement the byterange
standards.  More details will be available in a "known client problems"
page that I'm writing at the moment, which will appear in the
distribution and on the site in the future.

 Far more useful at this point would be tcpdumps of the wire.  I'm 100%
 certain we'll find apache is respecting the protocols and that adobe
 screwed up again.  That's what we found last time. 
 
 For reference sake, can you test navigator 3.x and acrobat 3.01 ?  That
 should work fine. 
 
 The types of dump I would need would be something like: 
 
     tcpdump -s 1576 -o dump.out tcp host <client-ip> and tcp host <server-ip> and tcp port <server-port>
 
 Then reproduce the broken behaviour ... and put dump.out somewhere where I
 can snag it.  Be sure to avoid any passwords on the wire, if your page is
 password protected then use a bogus userid for this test only. 
 
 Thanks
 Dean
