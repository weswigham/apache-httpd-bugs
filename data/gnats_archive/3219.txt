These errors do not appear until the Webserver has run continuously for approximately 2 days.  They appear in code that previously worked OK.  When the Webserver is stopped and re-started, the code will execute normally for another couple of days until the problem starts to re-appear.

State-Changed-Why:

Servlets and SSL are not part of the base Apache package,
which is what we support here.  If this refers to
mod_jserv, we can assign this PR to that project; otherwise
you need to contact the group from whom you obtained your
servlet package because we cannot help you.  Sorry.
