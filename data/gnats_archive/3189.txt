>Description:
Loading a module at runtime with DSO used to work fine with Apache 1.3.0
on the exact same system. I tried compiling mod_status as shared.

This is how I configured Apache 1.3.3:
CC=cc ./configure --prefix=/opt/local/apache/1.3.3 --enable-module=so --enable-shared=log_referer --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE

And this is what it says when I run it (with a LoadModule directive):
httpd: module "Segmentation Fault

No coredump (as far as I can see) or nothing, just that.

Compare 1.3.0 and 1.3.3, and see what has changed.

 First, you talk about mod_status but enabled DSO for mod_log_referer.  Hmmmm?
 Second, I cannot reproduce this problem, at least not under FreeBSD.  Can it
 be that you intermixed old DSOs (1.3.0) with a new httpd binary (1.3.3)?

State-Changed-Why:
The user's error can't be reproduced here, and Ralf can't
reproduce it either, so I am closing the PR.  If the user
is still having the problems please, clean out all remnants
of the previous 1.3 and reinstall with 1.3.3 and try
to reproduce the error again.  I tried on Solaris 2.6 with
the Sparcworks also, and got no error.
Thanks for using Apache though.
