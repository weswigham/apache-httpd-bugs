>Description:
I have conflict beetwen mod_proxy.c and  mod_alias.c in VirtualHost.

My config:
<VirtualHost diadema.album.nsk.ru:*>
ProxyPass / http://dema.sibtrump.ru/
</VirtualHost>

If I have 'Alias /Baikal /usr2/home/baikal' in srm.conf (not in VirtualHost)
and get http://diadema.album.nsk.ru/Baikal/ then ProxyPass - not  is working,
I see page from  http://www.album.nsk.ru/Baikal/


>How-To-Repeat:
http://diadema.album.nsk.ru/cgi-bin/price.cgi - not working
http://dema.sibtrump.ru/cgi-bin/price.cgi

State-Changed-Why:

You want everything below http://diadema.album.nsk.ru/Baikal/
to be served from your local server and all other
requests should be forwarded to the remote host (ProxyPass),
right?

The best way to do this is to use some RewriteRules
(mod_rewrite) instead of the global Alias and ProxyPass
directive.
See http://docs.apache.org/mod/mod_rewrite.html for details.

(Additionally you should consider upgrading to Apache 1.2.6)
