Linux dan.linux 2.4.3-20mdk #1 Sun Apr 15 23:03:10 CEST 2001 i686 unknown
>Description:
I wanted to be able to log the password given by an anonymous user in my access log, so I patched mod_auth_anon to make a note "anonpw" with the password for each request.  Then I can put %{anonpw}n in the access log to log it.
