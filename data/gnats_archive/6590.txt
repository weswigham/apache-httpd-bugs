>Environment:
WINDOWS98, APACHE1.3.12, JSERV1.1.2, JDK1.2.2, JSDK2.0., DB2 UDB version 6   
>Description:
When performing my servlet that is accessing a DB2 database the servlet receive the following error:

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no db2jdbc in java.library.path

My configuration is as follows in jserv.properties:

wrapper.classpath=C:\SQLLIB\JAVA\DB2JAVA.ZIP
wrapper.classpath=C:\SQLLIB\JAVA\RUNTIME.ZIP
wrapper.classpath=C:\Apache JServ 1.1.2\ApacheJServ.jar
wrapper.classpath=c:\jsdk2.0\lib\jsdk.jar

 
I've come accross simular problems (they were using oracle not DB2) in the bug database (4460 and 5624) but find no answers to these problems. There are, however referrences to the FAQ that I cannot find. 

Please help 

Luis 
>How-To-Repeat:
You would have to load DB2 on your machine and write a quik servlet to access the sample database.
