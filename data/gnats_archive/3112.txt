It worked with the first patch from Roy Fielding:
diff -u -r1.128 http_config.c
--- http_config.c       1998/09/21 21:09:47     1.128
+++ http_config.c       1998/09/25 07:41:49
@@ -1229,7 +1229,10 @@
        filename = ap_make_full_path(r->pool, d, w);
        f = ap_pcfg_openfile(r->pool, filename);
     }
-    if (f) {
+    if (!access_name[0]) {
+       dc = NULL;
+    }
+    else if (f) {

but it looked like some other problems occured with cgi execution..
The second official patch gives no results.
