OS: Solaris 2.6
Compiler: gcc
>Description:
I set up the proxy with ProxyPass:

ProxyPass / 	http://www.sprint.net/

It's ok to access regular html files. However, for URL of the format of 
http://host/program.cgi?arg, it requests only program.cgi from the remote 
server without passing the argument.

Thanks.
