>Description:
After authenticating a connection on my webserver, which loads a page containing an Applet, the Applet subsequently calls a Servlet.
Upon querying the req.getRemoteUser() in the service method I get null returned.
What could I be doing wrong, or this not the correct way of doing things ?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Does the ApacheJserv not acquire the remote user in the request header ?
