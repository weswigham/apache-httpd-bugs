State-Changed-Why:
I seem to have messed up the bugdb.

Yeah it's one of those "standards" that isn't really defined well and at
some point we had to make a decision about what PATH_INFO to pass where
(which affects PATH_TRANSLATED).  In particular, there are two possible
PATH_INFOs, the one on the request to the html file, and the one from the
#include or #exec in the html file.  #exec cgi doesn't support any
PATH_INFO on the command given to it, it only passes that which was
originally given on the original request. 

And now that I look at #include virtual it seems to be a bit whacked.  I
thought it was supposed to ignore any PATH_INFO from the .html and only
use that which is given on the #include virtual line.  Instead it seems to
override the #include virtual PATH_INFO with the PATH_INFO of the .html
request. 

Hmm.
