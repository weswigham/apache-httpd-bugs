The doc at http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_asis.html says:

>How-To-Repeat:
See http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_asis.html
>Fix:
Make the design decision that "as is" means what it says,
and update the docs to reflect the decision.  If necessary, add
mod_asis module configuration commands to turn server insertion of
individual headers such as Last-Modified-Date on and off.

 In fact, having the server add a Last-Modified header is a terrible idea.
 I'm not even convinced that it should add Date: or Server:, since the idea
 of "mod_asis" is to send the specified headers AS IS, that is, do not mess
 with them and don't add extra ones.  Adding Date: and Server: don't seem so
 harmful, but adding Last-Modified can cause problems since it's necessary to
 send a fake Last-Modified date to prevent incorrect document caching in MSIE.
 (Using the Cache-Control header is *not* enough--you have to use almost every
 header imaginable to get MSIE to not cache the document).
