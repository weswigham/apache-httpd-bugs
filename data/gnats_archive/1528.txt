State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Dec  7 20:13:04 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
First, if you are trying to report a bug the least you
can do is get the error message right.  It isn't
"405: problem not implemented" as you state.

Secondly, this is a basic configuration issue with your
server.  You need to properly insall php and have it parse
your files.  To figure out how to do that, you have to
read the manual.

As stated very clearly, we are not able to help with basic
configuration issues.

 i apologize for the problem not reported correctly, I am just VERY VERY
 VERY frustrated... every person i have talked to so far has not been able
 to help me with this problem, this does not include newbie admins or
 anyone like that, but it includes ISP admins from around the world; on
 EFNet #twilight_zone, #unix, #unixhelp, #linux, etc. 
 I did properly install PHP as far as I know, and I did read the manual and
 install it.
 I would really appreciate your help is RESOLVING this error.. as I am
 clueless and all other admins i know, including some of the largest
 Internet providers in the world.
 
 thank you,
 patrick
