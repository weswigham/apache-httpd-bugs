>Organization:
>Environment:
Tested on Solaris and Linux, with Apache 1.3.9 and 1.3.12.
>Description:
mod_autoindex generates its whole index inside <pre>. The module spits out a page which claims to be "HTML 3.2 Final". Inside the <pre> are <img> and <hr> tags which are not allowed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's the output of W3C's validator:

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fturbogeek.org&ss=&outline=&sp=
>Fix:
Messy, but I suppose changing:

<hr> -> </pre><hr><pre>
<img ...> -> </pre><img ...><pre>
