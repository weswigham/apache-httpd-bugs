>Description:
I am trying to mimic the following behavior:

<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status
</Location>

with my own handler, lets call it server-uptime.  As far as I can
tell (based on the documentation), I think the config should look
like this:

Action server-uptime /cgi-bin/uptime.cgi
<Location /server-uptime>
SetHandler server-uptime
</Location>

Shouldn't that work?  Unfortunately, I have not been able to get this
working UNLESS I actually have a file called "server-uptime" in the
DocumentRoot.  Even so, I still get the error "Handler "server-uptime"
not found.

My questions are:

1) Why does the file "server-uptime" have to exist when
   "server-status" in the first example doesn't have to?

2) Why do I get the "handler not found" message in my error log?

Any info/help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Pete

 Hi, I also ran into this bug today.  It looks like what's happening is
 that the warning falls between pass one and pass two in the
 handler-matching section of http_config.c
 
 Moving the warning until after the second pass suppresses the
 error unless the second pass also fails to match; I'm not sure that it's
 the right fix, though, as at this point the program returns a server
 error rather than just raising a warning.  Anyway, I'm using this locally
 to quiet apache down as matching on the second pass doesn't seem to cause
 any problems.   I figured I might as well submit the patch:

For your first question, try putting the Action directive
inside the Location container as well.

The second question is fixed by Dirk's patch and will
be included in the next version of Apache.
