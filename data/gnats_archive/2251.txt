On 1.2.0 this worked fine (example from memory)

<!--#set var="x" value="1" comment="example" -->

On 1.2.5 and 1.2.6 Apache just returns an SSI
error to the user instead of ANY page content
(even non-ssi content is skipped)

IMHO, as with HTML user agents, also servers 
should skip attributes they don't understand
when it is necessary for the server to parse the
page. Maybe with an optional warning. That way,
the server's use of SSI statements would reflect
the browsers handling of HTML objects.

No.  mod_include is a programming language, albeit a very
very simple one.  An ignored parameter could be a fatal, 
or at least a difficult to debug, mistake.
