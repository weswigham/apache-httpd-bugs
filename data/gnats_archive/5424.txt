>Description:
Two different servlet zones are mounted on the server, each with its own
servlet.Alias.code=Package.SubPackage.Classfile, only the first zone properties
file read has aliases which are seen on the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create 2 servlet zones, with 2 servlets (in a package type hierarchy, ie
package.test.servlet1, package.test.servlet2) Mount these zones under
different mount points and try to alias both servlets, each in their own
.properties file.
>Fix:
Work around:
	Put all aliases in the first zone properties file read.
