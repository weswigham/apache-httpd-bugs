>Description:
I have multiple IP's on my machine, with one of them
set up with "Bulk Virtual Hosting."

Everything works fine, except that CGI programs called on 
a virtual host under my virtual IP ends up getting a the
name of the first file references in my configuration file
reported as the Document_root instead the correct directory.
(Such as "/usr/local/apache/htdocs", presumably taken from
the '<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs"'>' directive.

This is rather hard to work around for me.  I could use
SCRIPT_FILENAME to locate the root directory, except that
when I use a Script_alias directive, the SCRIPT_FILENAME
is set to the script's directory (as it should) leaving no
obvious way to locate the correct Document_root

Document_root gets set correctly for my other "normal"
virtual hosts on the other IP's.
>How-To-Repeat:
I suspect that if you set up a machine with multiple IP's and
Virtual Hosst and make only one of them, preferably not the
first one, use the VirtualDocumentRoot directive, that it will
probably do the same thing.

If not, email me and I'll try to document and research
this better.

Here's some extracted coded.  I changed a lot of the
names "to protect the innocent" and I apologise if I
made any typos while doing that.  Hopefully you can
easily find the bug and reproduceit without this 
example though.

>Fix:
It's probably a bug in mod_vhost_alias.c .   If you can't
fix it, let me know.  Perhaps I could track it down myself.
(But I'm working 100+ hrs/wk on other stuff, so it's hard to
get to things quickly.)

Thanks!
