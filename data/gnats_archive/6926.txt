>Environment:
i386 Linux (redhat-6.2, 7.0) kernels 2.2.16 and above.  (at least on) Apache versions
1.3.12 and 1.3.14.  Using Sun's jdk1.3
>Description:
I have a java servlet which sets the response status whilst error handling, for
404's etc, this simply uses HttpServletResponse.setStatus(int).  This all used
to work fine under jserv-1.0 but since upgrading to jserv-1.1.2 I have noticed
that whilst the status is correctly sent back to the requester, the apache logs
no longer show the status as set by the setStatus, but instead always show
response code 200.  The only change here was upgrading jserv.

FYI I have ErrorDocument handlers set for most of the usual error codes, which
call a java servlet to produce an error page and set the status.
