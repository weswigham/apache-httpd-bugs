>Environment:
Windows NT Service Patch 3
AMD K6 200
>Description:
Installed the latest 1.3.4 binary distribution for WindowsNT but it failed
to create the httpd.conf file in the conf directory.

Because the directory is empty, apache could not be started.

As I do not have another machine that have apache running, I am unable to duplicate the required contents in there.

Someone else (#PR 3800) reported a similar problem for Windows98.

If you have a solution, please indicate if it would be better to UNINSTALLED the current version before reinstalling or applying some patch.

My machine is not permanently connected to the Internet, not sure if that contribute to the problem.

I do have Cygnus B20 installed (I like my unix stuff), not sure if the "uname" in Cygnus may cause problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
None

Sorry I am new to Apache on WindowsNT
