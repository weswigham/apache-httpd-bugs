Linux 2.2.17 #1 Mit Nov 15 13:38:42 CET 2000 i586 unknown w/ apache 1.3.9 compiled by gcc; in newer apache releases' CHANGES files I couldn't find anything related to the bug as described below, so I haven't upgraded first.
>Description:
When apache encounters an URI such as /cgi-bin/myscript.cgi/path/to/template.html it issues a subrequest to itself in order to get PATH_TRANSLATED. In combination with access restrictions on the file "/path/to/template.html" (e.g. a FilesMatch block anywhere in the server configuration), this behaviour leads to lots of unwanted error_log messages, as every access to the script is logged as a failed access to the raw template file.

The affected code seems to be in main/util_script.c:

    if (r->path_info && r->path_info[0]) {
        /*
         * To get PATH_TRANSLATED, treat PATH_INFO as a URI path.
         * Need to re-escape it for this, since the entire URI was
         * un-escaped before we determined where the PATH_INFO began.
         */
        request_rec *pa_req;

        pa_req = ap_sub_req_lookup_uri(ap_escape_uri(r->pool, r->path_info), r);
>How-To-Repeat:
Just set up a file inside your DocumentRoot, impose access restrictions on it (<Files test.html>\norder allow, deny\ndeny from all\n</Files>) and then access it via any cgi script that doesn't even need to use the file in any way (of course), with a request like http://my.server.com/cgi-bin/whatever/test.html -- then look into your error_log.

 Did you try with older versions to verify that this behaviour was
 introduced in 1.3.9?

 I think this is a misfeature rather than a bug, since it would be hard
 to fix -- there isn't a single location in the code where Apache could
 decide not to log access control errors because this is a subrequest
 or whatever; to the contrary, the logging is scattered all over the
 place.
 
 I'm also not convinced that this is a big problem in practice.
 
 Tony.

 No. In fact, I'd expected to see the problem around for some
 time.

 Agreed.

 On the other hand: Why is a 'real' subrequest necessary in order
 to get PATH_TRANSLATED?  Innocent proposal: Why not use some
 kind of 'request simulator' that might get used by other pieces
 of the code as well?  Would this have a chance to make those
 routines faster oder would it rather hurt apache's performance?

 Well, it clutters our error_log's with some hundreds of
 kilobytes of garbage per month, thus making it harder to find
 real error information when needed.

State-Changed-Why:

Consideration of this misfeature suspended, perhaps it will
be picked up for the 2.0 server development.  Such a major
change to a parser is very unlikely in the 1.3 development
branch.  Thanks for the report and your interest in the
apache server!
