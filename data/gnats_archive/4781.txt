>Environment:
NT Workstation/NT Server using JDK 1.2, Apache 1.3.4
>Description:
When I uninstall Apache JServ from NT's Add/Remove Programs I receive a message the the uninstall was successful but the name "Apache JServ 1.0b2ap1.3.3" is still listed.  If I try to uninstall again I receive a message the uninstal.log file is not found.  This is obvious since the uninstall the first time was successful.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Uninstall JServ 1.0b2 and verify it is still listed in the Add/Remove Programs.
>Fix:
The mindvision application you use to install should allow you to remove the entry from the registry unless this is a bug within the shareware version that you are using.  PS - The Mindvision VISE license screen indicates the distribution of commercial software is prohibited; you might want to check into that before a problem occurs.

 This was fixed in the later versions of the installer.

 No worries, we (of course) have a valid license for it.
