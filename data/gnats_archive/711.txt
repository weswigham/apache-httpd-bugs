Answer 27 and 40 in the FAQ both gives a solution on how to force HTTP/1.0
response for Java 1.0 clients. The problem is that in answer 27 says 
"BrowserMatch Java/1.0 force-response-1.0" while answer 40 says
"BrowserMatch Java1.0 force-response-1.0". 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
"BrowserMatch Java1.0 force-response-1.0" solves the JDK/HTTP problem. Fix the typo%2

BrowserMatch string in the first was indeed incorrect.  
Fixed.
