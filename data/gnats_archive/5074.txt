>Description:
Hi I'm running Apache 1.3.6 on an old SUN OS 4.1.3 machine. Everything thing has been running fine for years (with previouse versions of Apache, actually this problem forced us to try an upgrade, but no dice). My problem is that I can not get IE5 to authenticate into a passwd protected page, I don't get the dialogue box that allows me to enter my login and passwd, it just sends me a webserver error generated page saying "
"Error: 401
Browser not authentication-capable or authentication failed. If you saw a password dialog box, check your valid username and password and try again. If you did not see a password dialog box, then your browser does not support passwords and must be replaced with one that does." These are pages that are just using .htaccess. I have tried a ton of stuff from lowering (and customizing) my internet security levels, to dissabling hhtp 1.1 and SSL 2.0, 3.0 etc. I also tried new configurations with Apache itself changing "AllowOverride" to All and AuthConfig. We have tested it from inside the LAN and outside. We also run another Apache server 1.3 on our intranet and and also get nothing but the error message page. I have tested IE5 on a site that runs an older NCSA server and that site works fine.
We are behind a firewall but that has never been a problem. The funny thing is IE 4.0 works fine and all versions of Netscape work fine too. The Microsoft site is useless as always (I also emailed them and got a reply they would pass my problem on to the appropriate Microsoft group for review and response, but that was 2 weeks ago now) and I have posted this question on both newsgroups suggested and no one has been able to help (yet others seem to be having similar problems, been there 2 weeks). I have also reviewed the know client problems and tried stuff listed for IE4, but nothing. I am sorry but I have exausted my sources of possible information, can you help.

Your server is generating an invalid header, and IE is
well within its rights to say "what the heck?"

How are you generating this page?  Do you have any ErrorDocument
directives setup?  If so, what do they point to?  They probably point to a broken script or something.

 Thank you Marc;
 I do have a customized script for error responses, it has always worked so
 I did not think of looking at it again. I commented out my ErrorDocument
 directive and it worked. I will rewrite my script, but now I at least know
 where the problem is. 
 Again thanx a bunch!
