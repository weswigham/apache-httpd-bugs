State-Changed-Why:
We really don't want to go down the road of having 
zillions and zillions of options for all sorts of 
different ways of doing the HTML for the page.  What
may get done at some point in the future is the ability
to use a generic "template" where you can specify 
the entire layout yourself and have Apache fill in the
blanks with the file info.

 The option of allowing a template hasn't been closed; if someone writes
 it, it will get included.  However, 1.3 is in feature freeze right now so
 it probably wouldn't get in 1.3.  There is another PR in the database
 asking for a template that is probably suspended right now until 1.3 goes
 out.
 
 Note that anyone can code it themself as a separate module.
