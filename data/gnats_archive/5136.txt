Two solaris boxes conneced nfs with automount.
gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I'm trying to create a set of webpages that allows directory index viewing from a webserver to a remote filesystem over nfs.

I go to a sample url and the dir listing tipically comes up fine. Sometimes the icon for a folder or the parent dir arrow will be replaced with unknown.gif. If I browse to a subdir then come back 99% of the time I will get a permission denied page with these errors logged.

[Thu Oct  7 19:55:36 1999] [error] [client 209.17.141.34] (79)Value too
large for defined data type: access to /htdocs/c/ failed

209.17.141.34 - - [07/Oct/1999:19:55:36 -0700] "GET /htdocs/c/ HTTP/1.1" 403
298

What happened is that in the file http_request.c in the function get_path_info the stat call returned EOVERVLOW.

If I try a url that is still on the webserver there are no errors and no icon corruptions. This and the fact that the remote access works sometimes leads me to believe that I don't have any config problems.

I wrote small program to test stating over nfs with apache permissions to see if I was having networking problems. I couldn't generate any errors.

Any ideas? It would be nice for the sake of scalability if Apache could work reliably in this kind of environment.
>How-To-Repeat:
In your document tree put a soft symlink to an nfs mounted directory. 
Put some subdirs in the target directory. 
Access the remote dirs with a browser and browse up and down the remote tree.
If you see a broken parent dir icon try its link anb browse up.

State-Changed-Why:
This really doesn't sound like it has much to do with
Apache.  Are you sure you have the latest patch clusters
on your Solaris boxes?  If not, maybe you should.  If so,
maybe you shouldn't.

As the Solaris stat() man page says:

     EOVERFLOW The file size in bytes or  the  number  of  blocks
               allocated  to  the  file or the file serial number
               cannot be represented correctly in  the  structure
               pointed to by buf.

If a stat() on a directory returns that, then.. well...
not much Apache can do to cause that.

There are any number of reasons your test program may not
show it.  It may have to do with the way it is compiled
or linked or with having to do certain things in a particular
sequence with particular times between them.
