>Description:
When compiling latest Apache snapshot 20001008221200, I get the following warnings:

htpasswd.o: warning: tmpnam() possibly used unsafely, consider using mkstemp()
htdigest.o: warning: tmpnam() possibly used unsafely, consider using mkstemp()

Is it a possible security flaw ? I remember PHP fixed this "bug" with their own PHP recently.

This is on NetBSD 1.3.3 x86 with gcc 2.7.2.2, here's my configure line:

./configure --sbindir=/usr/www/etc/httpd/sbin \
            --prefix=/usr/www/etc/httpd \
            --enable-suexec \
            --suexec-safepath="/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/www/bin/php:/usr/www/web/b
in:/usr/www/web/bin/error" \
            --suexec-logfile=/usr/www/etc/httpd/logs/cgi.log \
            --suexec-caller=~ \
            --suexec-userdir=www \
            --suexec-docroot=/usr/www/web \
            --suexec-uidmin=100 \
            --suexec-gidmin=100
