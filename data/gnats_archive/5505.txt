Solaris SPARC 2.6
gcc 2.95 & gcc 2.95.2
any DSO module
>Description:
If any DSO module is configured in httpd.conf the following error occurs:

root@giant httpd# bin/apachectl start
Syntax error on line 128 of /local/www/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /local/www/httpd/libexec/libphp3.so into server: ld.so.1:
/local/www/httpd/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /local/www/httpd/libexec/libphp3.so:
symbol ap_user_id: referenced symbol not found
bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

I've tried other modules (mod_fastcgi, mod_dav, ...) and the error
is the same.

I looked into the source and ap_user_id is defined in src/main/http_main.c 

Problem does NOT occur in Solaris INTEL 7 with same version of compiler.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --enable-module=so 
and compile *any* mod as DSO.
>Fix:
Check the variable export mechanism ?!?
