>Release:        1.3b2
>Environment:
OS: NT 4.0, NT 3.51, Win95 - MS VC++ 5.0 - 1.3b2 no patches, release compile,
no fatals - bunches of warnings.
>Description:
Under "real life" conditions bith 1.3a and 1.3b2 truncate files at 16k.
This proble was previously reported (970) and closed as unreproducable.
A related problem (1086 - Send Body Lost Connection) has been partially cleared
in that the error message no longer occurs but data is still truncated.
When 1.3b2 is accessed via localhost or via a LAN connected (unrouted) client
ALL data is transfered.
If the connection is routed, files are truncated to 16k EXCEPT under the 
following conditions:
 - EXTREME connection (modem) activity. I got good outbound file transfers from
Apache during a 12 simultaneous connection download via a 26.4 modem connection.
 - Occasionally on an IMMEDIATE reload from the browser.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://gw1.woodall.com and follow the instructions.  The Apache host lives on
a Win95 box behind a firewall.
NOTE: Because this tunnel is shared with other development efforts, a (horror)
non-Apache server will sometimes answer.
 E-Mail me with a date/time and other suggestions if necessary.
 
>Fix:
Look at the manner in which Apache TCP/IP interface responds to changes in
 blocksize during data transfer (win32 interface).
BTW - Apache works just fine (it runs, stable, no smoke) on every platform I 
have tried it on.  It runs just fine on NT 3.51 console and I strongly suspect
similar behavior when installed as a service.
Keep up the FANTASTIC work%2

 Marc,
 
 Thanks!  Please noet that I have observed an 8K cut-off in Win95 too!
 So much for MS and standards...
 
 Thanks,
