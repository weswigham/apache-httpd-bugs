>Environment:
There is no problem compiling, Using FreeBSD 3.0 in this case but
I have the same problem on all of my servers. I also have it with
apache 1.1.1 ... any only with MSIE 5.0
>Description:
I upgraded my apache, did everything I can think of, still have same
problem. I run a chat site which uses a C based CGI to repost the data
which is sent to the chat server on a socket.

MSIE 5.0 will run fine for awhile then I get the incomplete header error.
I put MSIE 5\.0; BrowserMatch line in to give HTTP-1.0 responses but this
didnt' fix it either.

I can backpage twice and get it to run again, but the problem gets more
frequent as I "chat" more.

http://www.alamak.com/login.html is the USA site login.

Could you put in a section to the broswer compliance section for MSIE 5.0?
And if you have any clue as to how to fix this I'd be very appreciative. If
I can't fix it and it's MickySucks problem then let me know so I can forget
about it and put the blame on them. *laugh*

UR favorite unix bigot .. John
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to http://www.alamak.com/login.html and login to the chat
Chat with MSIE 5.0 for about 5 minutes and you'll get an error.
The error log says it's incomplete header information.
>Fix:
Nope, tried everything I can think of... icnluding installing the latest
apache.

 Oh, you're running apache in inetd mode? 
 
 That mode probably has bugs... in fact I'm about to remove it from the
 server.  Try running apache in standalone mode please.

 No I am not, I always run standalone, I did find the problem. I don't
 know why it manifested this way but in fact the problem was solved.
 
 IE5.0 seems to require that one item in a select list be selected or
 it sets no value for that form element. This particular service got
 you thrown out when the field was empty and I had been relying on
 Netscape behavior to select the first item in the list if none other
 was selected.
 
 The problem is intermittent and increases as you use the IE5 more on
 the same page. Sometimes it has the first item selected sometimes not.
