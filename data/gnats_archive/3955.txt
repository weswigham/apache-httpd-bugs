>Description:
We are hoping to use JServ as the web server side of an application.  
There is database and general code that our servlets must have access to
and that must be initialized in the JVM that runs the JServ engine.  
Unfortuanately since JServ runs as a thread from main,  doing this
sort of thing is inconvenient.  What would be ideal is to make
JServ implement Runnable and put the socket listening stuff inside
of the run() method.   That way we  could run the JServ engine as another
thread inside of our application, and I think this is in general a better
design since it is more flexible.   As it is now I have hacked the JServ
class to do as I have stated and it works fine, but it would be much
better if this was part of the actual distribution.

 This is a volunteer effort, so, I suggest that you subscribe to either the
 java-apache@list.working-dogs.com list or the
 jserv-dev@list.working-dogs.com list and feel free to submit patches to the
 group.
