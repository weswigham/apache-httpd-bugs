Reverting back to 1.3b3 fixes the problem.

 But default does take a directive... the difference between 1.3b3 and
 1.3b5 in this respect is the same as between 1.2.4 and 1.2.5... when
 fixing a bunch of security issues with mod_imap I made it actually report
 errors in its arguments rather than just continue blindly doing something
 undefined.
 
 Previously that line would have been completely ignored.
 
 That looks like it was generated by a tool... is there any difficulty in
 getting the tool to not emit the default directive?
