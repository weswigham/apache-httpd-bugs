Command : 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --with-layout=GNU

Installation paths generated in Makefile :

/usr/local/apache/etc      instead of  /usr/local/apache/etc/httpd
/usr/local/apache/var      instead of  /usr/local/apache/var/httpd
/usr/local/apache/share    instead of  /usr/local/apache/share/httpd
/usr/local/apache/include  instead of  /usr/local/apache/include/httpd 

These options work correctly with version 1.3.4 !!

Thank you for your help.

 Hmmm... what is "correct" here no one can decide. The reason why httpd is not
 added is because the trailing strings are appended to prevent messing up
 system directories. One indicator that APACI doesn't mess up something is that
 Apache's name occurs in the path. And an "apache" in $prefix is IMHO even more
 unique than a "httpd". So the behaviour in 1.3.6 is correct IMHO.
