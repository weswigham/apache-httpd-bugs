This has been installed for me and person left without supplying apache version
not sure how to find.

All related web pages are published to /home/httpd/html/ directory.

I can get .htaccess to work when I put it in /home/httpd/ it will prompt for username and password before allowing access to home page.

When I put the .htaccess file in /home/httpd/html/markc/ so users can not access
web pages under this directory it ignores the access file.

I have checked FAQ's confirmed file format and can see no apparent wrong with .htaccess file at sub directory level.

 rbbloom,
 
 In reply to your mail I am running version 1.2.5.
 I have viewed the error_log when running .htaccess and there are no related
 messages.
 In the accerss_log I get this message:
 access_log: GET /markc/xyplex_port.html /HTTP/1.1  304-
 
 Please tell me there is a fix without upgrading  to 1.3 ??????

 Mark,
 
 What is your AllowOverride Directive set to?  It sounds like you have it set to
 None for your subdirectories, which will cause Apache to not check your
 htaccess files.

 Is this in a Directory container?
 
 If so, what what?
 
 Where on the filesystem is the htaccess file located?
 
 Are you sure the Directory container in question covers that location?

 Marc,
 
 In reply to your prior message there are some areas I do not fully
 understand so in order to help you to help us here is a copy of our
 access.conf file to suggest any possible solutions.
 In reply to your questions ?
 
 Is this in a Directory container?
 >> I am not sure what a directory container is ?
 
 If so, what what?
 
 Where on the filesystem is the htaccess file located?
 All files as per access.conf for web are in /home/httpd/html/
 so have created a suddir under html called markc and put files in there.
 
 >> .htaccess file is located in /home/httpd/  = does work here. ( prevents
 access to main page )
 >> and located in /home/httpd/html/markc/  = does not work here.
 
 Are you sure the Directory container in question covers that location?
 
 >> As I am not sure about directory container I do not know how this
 directory can be covered
 by .htaccess file and rules.
 Or where to make thwe relevent entry in access.conf.

 A Directory container is a "<Directory foo...>" then a few lines then
 "</Directory>" bit in the config file.  It makes restrictions on a per
 directory basis.

 Go through the docs on the AllowOverride directive.  Here, it says that
 AuthConfig is allowed, which is what you appear to want to do in your
 htaccess file.
 
 [...]
 > <Directory /home/httpd/html>
 > AllowOverride none
 > Options All
 > </Directory>
 
 Then this section, for the html directory, says that no overrides are
 allowed which means that htaccess files will be ignored in that directory,
 which is the behaviour you are seeing.

 Most clients will cache the authentication information for some period 
 of time after they authenticate; often until the client is exited from.
