>Environment:
At least Amdahl's UTS 2.1
>Description:
The code for determining ticks per second doesn't work on a system that
doesn't support sysconf().  There was also specific code for the NEXT
operating system that used HZ; I recommend always defaulting to that if 
_SC_CLK_TCK is not defined (assuming it is not defined on NEXT).

It turns out that I couldn't fully test this on UTS 2.1 where I had the
problem, because of a compiler bug that causes it to fail at the assembly
stage.  I ended up disabling it with --disable-module=status.  A very similar
problem had already had me disabling the include module on this operating
system.
