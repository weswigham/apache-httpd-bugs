>Environment:
SunOS shell1 5.5.1 Generic_103640-03 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10
>Description:
I run an image archive and have a problem with people linking directly to
pictures on my site. At the ISP that I previously used, they added a redirect
command that would redirect an address based on the refering pages address.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://members.aol.com/darrkon/images.htm
This site is an example of what I am trying to stop.
>Fix:
Create a new command that will redirect based on the refering pages address. An
example of how it was done with another server can be found at

State-Changed-Why:
You can already do this using RewriteCond, one of the directives
available in mod_rewrite.  Install mod_rewrite and give it a try.
See the docs for more info.

Thanks for using Apache!
