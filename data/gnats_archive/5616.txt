>Description:
I created a dbmfile using dbmmanage /usr/local/apache/auth/usersdbm adduser test
The file /usr/local/apache/auth/usersdbm is created (without any extension)and 
dbmmanage usersdbm view shows me the user test and the encrypted password.
so I tried a .htaccess
AuthDBMUserFile /usr/local/apache/auth/usersdbm
AuthName "Administrator"
AuthType Basic
require valid-user


But I always get the message:
(2)No such file or directory: could not open dbm auth file: /usr/local/apache/auth/usersdbm

State-Changed-Why:

You aren't using the same dbm from dbmmanage as you compiled
Apache with (-lndbm, -lgdbm etc.)  Change the xDBM_File
list in your dbmmanage script.
