We have recently downloaded apache server and installed on a windows 95 machine. We we are trying to run apache from console, it runs and immediately comes back to dos prompt. The error log is giving following message:
 (crit)make_sock:failed to get the socket for port 80

State-Changed-Why:
Two thoughts come to mind...
1. You need winsock 2 installed (see the FAQ for details)
Apache 1.3.9 requires Winsock 2. I have a fix to explicitly
check this in 1.3.10
2. You have another service/application running on your
machine using port 80. Use netstat -a to check this.

Thr problem is almost certainly one of the two, so I am closing this PR.
