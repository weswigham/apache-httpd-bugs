DG/UX R4.11MU03 Aviion Pentium

See suggested fix

See suggested fix
>Fix:
I have two machines both running DG/UX with R4.11Mu03, one's a Motorola 88K box the other Intel. The "Configure" procedure worked fine on the motorola but not on the intel.

The fix ( after reading and reading again! the OS release notes ) is to change the lines in "Configure" to:

OS='DG/UX 5.4'
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DDGUX -D_DGUX_THREADS_EXTENSIONS"
LIBS="$LIBS -lresolv -lsocket -lnsl -lc "
DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes

It will compile then. Hope this is of some use. Apache is excellant by the way

 The original DG/UX settings worked fine on 88k, but I had trouble starting 
 the server which was related to the user-name that the daemon runs as.
 
 As for the Intel platform, the changes I outlined were necessary to get the 
 thing to compile. I found the references in the Release Notice ( Part No. 
 085-600465-01 ) for DG/UX R4.11.
 
 Oh, both platforms, 88k and Intel, are running the MU03 maintenance 
 update.
 
 I hope that this is useful.
