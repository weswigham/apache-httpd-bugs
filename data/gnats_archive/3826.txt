State-Changed-Why:

Please read the page that got you here:

"If you're tracing spam or you're here because one of your favourite Web sites now says
'It Worked! Apache is installed!' -- then contact the mail originator or the Web site's
Webmaster directly, because they're just using our software and we have nothing to do
with them. Don't waste your time or ours by telling us about it."
