>Description:
When the main site server is running with HostnameLookups Off, it is useful
to be able to turn them on for access restrictions in .htaccess files.

I'm running a test server with this functionality added - is there a reason
why it isn't in the Apache code, or would you like the patch?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Adding |OR_AUTHCFG to the list of flags in the HostNameLookup declaration in
http_core.c seems to add the functionality

Comment-Added:
1.3b2 now does a double-DNS check when the .htaccess mentions
hostnames, no matter what the HostNameLookups setting is.  
From the CHANGES file:

  *) mod_access overhaul:
     - Now understands network/netmask syntax (i.e.  10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0)
        and cidr syntax (i.e. 10.1.0.0/16).  PR#762
     - Critical path was sped up by pre-computing a few things at config
        time.
     - The undocumented syntax "allow user-agents" was removed,
        the replacement is "allow from env=foobar" combined with mod_browser.
     - When used with hostnames it now forces a double-reverse lookup
        no matter what the directory settings are.  This double-reverse
        doesn't affect any of the other routines that use the remote
        hostname.  In particular it's still passed to CGIs and the log
        without the double-reverse check.  Related PR#860.
