>Environment:
General problem, regardless of compiler and os
>Description:
I researched further the problem I reported with PR# 354. Here are my findings.

When executing a script with suexec, apache calls getgrgid without
checking whether the returned group pointer is null.  This will cause
apache to dump core on the subsequent execle if the user's default
group isn't in /etc/group. The fix is below.

Obviously, this is suboptimal, but as long as suexec insists on taking
group names on the command line, it'll have to do. I wonder why suexec
requires user and group names instead of just uids and gids?

Just refiling into suexec.

Submitter also said in PR#368:

The fourth argument should be r->server, not pw->pw_gid. Sorry.
