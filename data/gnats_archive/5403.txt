Linux 2.0.36 as well as the apache.org server
>Description:
If .../file.html is a valid (file) URL, when you attempt to reference
.../file.html/foobar.html the file .../file.html will be loaded rather than getting a file not found error.  In addition, the file does not usually load properly as links are treated relative to (the nonexistent) foobar.html

State-Changed-Why:

This is not a bug.  This is intentional and designed
behaviour.  The extra information is called "path info,"
and is made available to the file in case it's active
(like a CGI script, PHP page, or SSI document).
