>Environment:
Windows NT workstation SP3, using 1.3b3 pre-combiled binaries
>Description:
Installed Apache, works OKAY! When I tried to install as a service 'apache -i'
jammed service manager. Killed service manager, system okay. Will not run as
a service.

PROBLEMS:

1) How do I get it out of the service database? 'apache -u'? No documentation
on the topic.

2) Norton Anti-Virus 2.01 has stopped running on my system.

Problem happened on 2 out of 2 NT systems I tried.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
At least update the documentation a bit, installing and un-installing NT
services isn't really described, and that's how us NT people like to run
things like this.

Hope this is useful to you

 Hi,
 
 I deletes everything, and reinstalled it the root of my d: drive, and it
 runs fine, didn't mess up any of the services this time.

User reinstalled and it worked ok.  Yes, there are doc
changes needed, but they will come slowly as the installation
gets fixed up to work better.

 Sorry I should have told you earlier. But the pre-compiled binaries won't
 run unless installed in \Apache from where they work great (for a beta that
 is!).
 
 Keep up the good work, I wish I could contribute more, but I don't program
 in c, just pascal!
