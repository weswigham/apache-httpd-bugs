Receiving "67)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to port 80"
errors on AIX4.2.1 box.

I have hard restarted it like the docs say but they still show up every 60 secs.

(side note, in order to compile on AIX4.2 I had to modify os.c and add #if (AIX < 42) like a previous PR mentions.  The previous PR used (AIX < 43) but indeed it's 42.

State-Changed-Why:

If you're getting an error message about port 80 already
being in use, then either that's the case or your operating
system is very ill.  Do you have multiple Listen or
VirtualHost directives referencing the same address and
port?  When you think the server is shut down, what does
"netstat -an | grep ':80'" show?

[Input from submitter, who did *not* Cc apbugs]
Ok I finally figured it out..I have apache set as 'respawn' in the inittab.

Every so often the inittab will try to kick off a new httpd and fail because
of the port failures.

So my question is:
        Can the apache server be set to 'respawn' in the inittab?
        If the parent process of apache never dies, I would assume it could.

Going through the Apache PR database, this may be related to PR 2662.
