 Not from the Apache group.  Where did you obtain this file?

 Were you using mod_perl before?  This does not look to be anything related
 to the base Apache distribution, but something like an external module
 that someone else supplies.
 
 Please try compiling it yourself, doing whatever you did with previous
 versions.

 This is almost certainly a compiler misconfiguration on your end. 
 __builtin_va_alist is how gcc's stdargs support works.  It looks like
 you're either missing the gcc headers, or your compiling with the gcc
 headers but using Sun's cc.  Or you have a mixture of files compiled with
 Sun's cc and gcc.
