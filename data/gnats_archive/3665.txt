>Description:
I will use the SimpleServlet as example to explain this.
The setup is as follows
1 servlet zone (divinedevelopment) wo is on the disk in 
 /devsites/telesales/servlets/
In subdirectory /devsites/telesales/servlets/divine I have a file named
 SimpleServlet.java 

now look at this:
BMZ01FONSNWW02:/devsites/telesales/servlets# head divine/SimpleServlet.java 
package divine;

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

    public class SimpleServlet extends HttpServlet
   
so it in pakage divine.
I compile and get a file /devsites/telesales/servlets/divine/SimpleServlet.class

with Apache jserv 0.9 I did

http://10.2.12.151/servlets/divine/SimpleServlet

to get it to work. Now it gives me

the response is
----------
Not Found

The requested URL /servlets/divine was not found on this server.

I tried to type
http://10.2.12.151/servlets/divine.SimpleServlet
(which isn't right for me anyway because the program that runs on the machine 
is coded to use /divine/SimpleServlet and I can't change the source so 
it isn't even an option.)

and the result is
------
Not Found

The requested URL /servlets/divine.SimpleServlet was not found on this server.

>How-To-Repeat:
I think the description explains how to recreate also.
>Fix:
for the problem with the divine.SimpleServlet, I think the 
class(re)loader and the names past to it so be checked by you
 guys but on the other hand:

I think a good solution for the slash solution whould be, that :

if a servlet can't be loaded and the javaengine can find 
a subdir in one of its repositories of the zone, that has 
the name of the servlet that cant be found, then get the 
first part of the env. path_info(up to the first /), make 
path info = current path info-(up to first path info), change
 the servlet to be loaded in currentservlet="currentservlet"."(up to first/)"
and try to load this one.

If this fails then recurse previous routine (ofcourse repository should
 be a "temp repos" so that one can append the last found directory parth
to it. (or use a var that one automatically appends to the reposit dirs)

say that one can't find the servlet if all / are removed from the path_info
 and still no servlet is found.
