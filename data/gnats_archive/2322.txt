>Environment:
http server, proxy: SunOS texatrium 4.1.4 1 sun4m
socks server: SunOS support 4.1.4 1 sun4m
compiler: gcc 2.7.2.2
Socks: 4.2.2, 5.0
>Description:
When users go to sites that are aliases (e.g. www.carpoint.com) they experience
very long delays when downloading pages. By long delays, I mean that a few pieces
of the page are sent then there is a one or two minute (almost exactly a multiple
of a minute) delay, then a few more pieces are sent, etc., until the download
is complete. Caching is turned on, but no improvement is seen.

I have used apache versions 1.2.5, 1.2.6 and 1.3b7 with socks 4.2.2 and 5.0 with
no improvement.

When the user uses socks only, there is an initial one or two minute delay, then
the rest of the download proceeds without significant delay. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Run apache 1.3b7 on an internal system (that is, not the same system as the
firewall). Run socks5 on the firewall system. Use runsocks to start up apache.
Try going to www.carpoint.com and wait.
>Fix:
Well, it seems that the redirect may not be working right (although I'm a little
fuzzy on what 'right' is). It seems that the redirect might be cached, so the 
proxy system doesn't have to figure out what the real system is every time it
tries to get more pieces of the page. I suspect that is what the netscape client
does when it goes through the socks server directly.

 Hello,
 
 	This is a follow up to my original report. I have installed
 	Apache 1.3.1 on a Solaris 2.5.1 (HW 11/98). I am running with
 	Bind 4.9.6 and socks5. The problem has gone away, possibly due
 	to the difference in the OS. The original problem was
 	duplicated on SunOS 4.1 and Solaris 2.5.1 (Original
 	release). The patch level between the Original Release and
 	11/98 is substantial.
 
 						Regards,
 						Dano
