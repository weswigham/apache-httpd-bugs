>Description:
Looking for a workaround that will allow a CGI script, called as an SSI, 
to inject a cookie-setting command into the header sent to the client. 
Apache obviously is aware of the header being sent by the CGI, as it 
will give a cannot-include error if it is not present. Would it be possible 
to set the cookie through a META tag in HTML?

State-Changed-Why:
There is no way for Apache to set a cookie in the
request header based on SSI output at some point in the
body because the header has already been sent.  You need
to design your system some other way to remove that need.

There may be some META tag that can set a cookie in the
body, however I am not aware of any.

 Thanks. I messed around and found that 
 <META HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie" CONTENT="$newcookie">
 will, indeed, do it, at least for some equipment configurations.
