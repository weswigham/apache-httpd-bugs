>Description:
I'm running an Apache 1.2.4 with JServ 0.9.11 and the URI rewiting for
packages (as you describe in your Apache Jserv FAQ) works fine.

(fe. /db/admin/news/UpdateForm -> /db/admin.news.UpdateForm)

With my new Apache 1.3.4 with JServ 1.0b2 this does not work!
[05/02/1999 10:29:48:455] (ERROR) ajp11: Servlet Error: ClassNotFoundException: admin

If am using the URI /db/admin.news.UpdateForm everything works
fine for both servers (0.9.11 & 1.0b2) but i really like the rewiting feature.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry - it's a server behind a firewall
>Fix:
I think it's a communictation/parameter problem between the httpd and the jserv
