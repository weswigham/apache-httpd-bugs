>Description:
Apache's mod_include calls ap_getparents() when doing an <!--#include--> directive.
This is not just for `IncludesNOEXEC' pages, but also for `Includes' pages.
It's trivial to come up with a way around this bogus restriction in shtml files
if execution of programs is allowed ("cat filename" comes to mind).
>How-To-Repeat:
<!--#include file="../hi.txt"-->
>Fix:
Only call ap_getparents on `IncludesNOEXEC'.  Allow parent directories otherwise
(i.e., for pages with full `Includes' privileges).
Ideally, mod_include should have some way to figure out if a relative path
with `../' in it is within the user's allowed web tree, but that solution is
pipe dream at best.

State-Changed-Why:
include file is not really recommended and has this limitation

Use include virtual instead.

 I expected this answer.  Before I resubmit the PR, I'll offer a full
 explanation and hope someone will see this addendum.
 
 If I want to do so, if IncludesNOEXEC is not set, I can <!--#exec
 cmd="/bin/cat /etc/passwd"--> just as easily as I could #include the file.
 
 So, this isn't a justification for disallowing access to arbitrary files.  I
 *want* #include file="" to work for parent directories and arbitrary files
 wien the permissions are there, to avoid the extra overhead implied by
 #include virtual="".  What the PR-closing comment didn't say is *why* that
 should be disallowed even for the `Includes' (with exec) case.
 
 In any case, Apache as packaged by the NetBSD pkgsrc system does not have
 this restriction.

 Huh?  Do you really think that submitting the PR over and over will do
 anything except piss people off?

 So?
 
 First, it is an extremely poor design to have a directive called
 IncludesNOEXEC that also disables including other sorts of files.  If you
 want to do it for your personal use, then great.  But remember that you
 aren't the one having to support people who get confused by this BS.
 
 Second, I'm not sure what you mean by "extra overhead implied by include
 virtual" and can't see how that could make any difference worth bothering
 about.  Have you actually gone through and understood what overhead there
 is and isn't and how it fits into the big picture?

 It is unfortunate that you think the role of someone building packages for
 an OS is to use that position to make incompatible and unwanted changes to
 that program to suit their own likings.  It introduces needless
 incompatibilities and just makes life more difficult for everyone.  
 Please do not change things to fit your whims.
 
 Crap like this is one of the reasons that, time after time, I have to
 recommend that people just download Apache and install it themself because
 their vendor has gone and stupidly messed around with the one that comes
 with their OS.
