On HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED content 'Set-Cookie' is not one of the header options listed to be pulled from r->headers_out. Any cookies set with fixuphandlers or what not are ignored.

=== telnet 123.123.123.123 80 ==
GET /somefile.html HTTP/1.0

you will see the Set-Cookie line in the response
=== telnet 123.123.123.123 80 ==
GET /somefile.html HTTP/1.0
If-Modified-Since: {the timestamp returned on the above test goes here}

the cookies will not be present in the headers

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sat Dec  8 21:04:56 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
It is not valid to set a cookie in a 304 response.  Please see section 10.3.5 of RFC2616.  That is the reason Apache explictly lists headers that will be sent and why Set-Cookie isn't one of them.
