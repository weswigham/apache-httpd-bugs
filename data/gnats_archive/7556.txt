>Description:
apache 2.0.16 is successfully compiled with following configure options: 
./configure --enable-modules=all --disable-auth-dbm --disable-auth --with-mpm=threaded --enable-so --with-ssl 

php4.0.4pl1 (compiled and successfully working for Apache 1.3.17) configure has following options: 
./configure --with-mysql --with-pgsql --enable-trans-sid --enable-track-vars --with-pdflib=/usr/local
--with-gd --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

Compilation of php4 aborts at:

These lines were present in httpd.h of Apache 1.3.19, but not in Apache 2.0.16 beta.
Maybe I am wrong, but above specified error is gone doing this way. 

Btw, it seems that mod_php4.c is not ready for apache 2, since compilation
of this module aborts with lots of warnings and 
mod_php4.c:800: `this_module_needs_to_be_ported_to_apache_2_0' undeclared here (not in a function)
that addresses me in this way :-)

 This seems to be fixed in the latest version of PHP's cvs, try that...

 Ok, I'll tryu later on, but what's about those line missing in apache's 
 httpd.h?
 Is it really a bug/mistake or not?

State-Changed-When: Fri Apr 13 09:35:40 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
If php isn't yet setup to work with Apache 2.x, then that is
something you have to take up with the php guys.

The non-HTTP_* versions of the defines were only there for legacy reasons in 1.x.
