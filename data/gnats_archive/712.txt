>Description:
I have looked at apache.org and a couple of mirror sites and when accessing :-

apache_1_2_0-mips-sgi-irix5_3_tar.tar

I can not extract this file. I have tried several ways and just want to be sure that this file is not corrupt in any way before I spend any more time on the project.
>How-To-Repeat:
Please could you try extracting

apache_1_2_0-mips-sgi-irix5_3_tar.tar

On your system.

State-Changed-Why:
The apache_1.2.0-mips-sgi-irix5.3.tar.gz file is fine on
the website.  I am not sure where you are trying to get
apache_1_2_0-mips-sgi-irix5_3_tar.tar from.  The file
on the website is compressed with gzip and tared.  You
need gzip to decompress it, and then need to untar it.

gzcat apache_1.2.0-mips-sgi-irix5.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
is one command line you could use.
