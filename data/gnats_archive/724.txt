Possibly relevant stuff:
  Quota support installed,
  /usr and / are different filesystems,
  Virtual hosts in use.
>Description:
Hi!

I hope this is just me being thick, or doing something wrong...

I followed the instructions on the "Security tips" page, but users can still
make symbolic links enabling the root directory to be viewed :-(

From what I understand, this should not be the case?
>How-To-Repeat:
Here are the steps I took:

# ln -s / /home/[innocentuser]/public_html

Then I edited conf/access.conf to include:

<Directory />
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
</Directory>
# Now we have to explicitly enable access to home directories:
<Directory /home/*/public_html>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Directory>

Unfortunately, if I include the second <Directory> directive, then on viewing
http://localhost/~innocentuser/ I get a full directory listing of / :-(
>Fix:
I suspect this is to do with Apache's symbolic link handling - is there a directive
to stop Apache following links in home directories, say, that would take it outside
the allowed directory structure?

Thanks,

Jonatha

State-Changed-Why:
You want to look at Options FollowSymLinks or SymLinksIfOwnerMatch.
You probably want to disable both at the / and then enable
whichever you want in your document root and in /home/*/public_html.
