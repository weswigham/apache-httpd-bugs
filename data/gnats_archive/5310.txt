Hi,
    I try to run Apache1.3.9 on both Windows NT4 and 2000.  It works fine for NT4.  When I try to run apache.exe on command line, I got this message:

"apache: cannot determine local host name.
Use the ServerName directive to set it manually."

Any idea?
>How-To-Repeat:
install apache1.3.9 on Win2k RC2 and run it.

Well, then set the ServerName directive in the config file.
