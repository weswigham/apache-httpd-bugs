1) The docs refer to both "Anonymous_NoUser" and "Anonymous_NoUserID".
The second is correct.

2) The docs do not mention that a password file must be specified with
AuthUserFile. The example doesn't mention this at all. A zero-length file
works just fine.

State-Changed-Why:
The first item (Anonymous_NoUserID) will be corrected
shortly.  As for the second.. AuthUserFile isn't a
directive supplied by mod_auth_anon.  Do you mean that
mod_auth_anon's documentation needs to mention that an
AuthUserFile must exist for the location in order for
mod_auth_anon to work?

 Thanks.

 Yes. I've done some further testing and it seems that both AuthUserFile and
 AuthType must both be either 1) defined or 2) inherited at the location where
 the mod_auth_anon directives are used. In other words, you either have to define
 them where you use them or make sure that the server can see them where they are
 used.

 [Text from originator, accidentally attached to the wrong part of the
 bugdb]
 
 Here's the appropriate part of access.conf for my test machine.
 
 <Location /server-status>
 SetHandler server-status
 order deny,allow
 deny from all
 allow from 127.0.0.1
 require valid-user
 AuthName Server Status: Use 'anonymous' and your email address for access
 AuthType basic                           #********
 AuthUserFile conf/server-passwd          #********
 Anonymous_Authoritative on
 Anonymous anonymous guest
 Anonymous_LogEmail on
 Anonymous_VerifyEmail on
 Anonymous_NoUserID off
 </Location>
 
 If either or both of the two marked lines are commented out, I get
   "access to /server-status failed for 127.0.0.1, reason: configuration error:
   couldn't check user.  No user file?"
 messages in the error log.
 
 I've done some further testing and these lines are needed *only* if they are not
 otherwise defined. I tried adding them in a "<Directory />" section and it
 works. My current setup did not have them. Seems like they have to be "visible"
 in some way.
 
 It's not a big deal. I just think it should be stated clearly in the
 documentation.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry about the delay in getting back to this..  The 
missing directive has been documented.  I think the problem
with the required AuthUserFile is actually stemming from
mod_auth, not mod_auth_anon; I need to do some checking
here.  If that's the case, it might be appropriate for
mod_auth to not return failure on a missing file unless it's
Authoritative.

For now, can you confirm what version of Apache you're using?
And whether you have mod_auth compiled in?  (I'm pretty
sure you do..)
