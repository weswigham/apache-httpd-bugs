AllowOverride All

<Directory /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/HyperNews/.scripts>
AllowOverride All
Options ExecCGI
</Directory>

This appears to me to enable cgi in these two directories, but I'm getting the error in the browser
You don't have permission to access /HyperNews/Admin/setup-form.cgi on this server.
I have checked the unix permissions on the cgi files, and all the relevant directories and files.  
They are set to be universally executable (-rwxr-xr-x).

Apache seems to be ignoring the directive to allow execution of cgi's in these directories.  When I check
/apache/logs/error_log it shows this:
Options ExecCGI is off in this directory: /www/htdocs/HyperNews/edit-member.pl 


>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.interlabs.org/HyperNews/
click on any of the listed scripts.

State-Changed-Why:
Take a look at the paths again.  You are trying to access
a script in /www/htdocs/HyperNews/ while allowing ExecCGI
in /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/HyperNews.
