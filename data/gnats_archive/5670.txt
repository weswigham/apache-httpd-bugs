>Originator:     apache@udoheld.de
>Release:        1.3.11
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 98, German, OEM, First Version, perl 5.005_03, all these are orignal binaries and aren't self-compiled
>Description:
I started a perlscript. It's working well on other Windows www-servers.
The perlscript itself openes another program. Now the output of that program
isn't given back to the script like it should be. The output of the script is
given back to the apache console. There it is useless.
Apache 1.3.9 popped up a new dosconsole.
>How-To-Repeat:
I uploaded an example to http://udoheld.de/perlscript.zip
It's 2.13KB big. I documented it in English. I gave an emxample how to repeat
the problem in the readme.txt file.
>Fix:
The data given back to the apache console should be given back to the script,
so that it can work with this data.

You need Windows 9x and a working perl installaion. You will get different 
results with apache 1.3.9 and 1.3.11. I used the binary ports.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 16 18:42:18 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

If I interpret your comments correctly, your perl process
spawns another process.  Therefore it is -absolutely-
responsible for passing the input/output pipes to it's
child process.

If you have 'reopened' the input or output pipe of stdin
or stdout (for binary mode access, perhaps), you will have
unlinked Apache's script output handler.  You need to toggle
the mode to binary without trying to close and open the
stdout channel.
