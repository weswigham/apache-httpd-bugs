Apache 1.3b6 precompiled apache.org, Win95OSR2, 64Megs RAM
>Description:
For some reason, when using <directory> directive
(<directory c:/apache/htdocs/s10-4x4/public/messages>)
a trailing "/" is sometimes needed, and other times
is needed, depending on wether the desired outcome is
meet.  Cannot identify a pattern.  

When compared to: Alias /systemimages/ c:/apache/systemimages/,
a trailing "/" is always reqired in both arguments.

Would like to see the trailing "/" required for all directives
when pointing to any directory or URL path.  This would
"standardize" the config throughout.  

Also, it seams that it was required with 1.3b3 in the
<Directory> directive, but with 1.3b6 I had to remove it.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm sorry, I don't understand exactly what you are trying
to get at.

Please give exact examples of where a trailing '/' is needed
and you think it shouldn't be or where it isn't needed
and you think it should be.

If you should use a trailing '/' or not depends on exactly
what you need things to apply to.

This really is more suited to asking on Usenet to clear up
your confusion rather than submitting a bug report for
something that you may not understand properly...

 With 1.3b3, a trailing "/" was normally required in
 the <directory ..path..> directive, but with 1.3b6
 I had to remove them to make the path valid for Apache.
 
 I suggested requiring the trailing forward slash in
 all directives for unity throughout all configurations,
 when refering to either a URL or a local path.
 http://www.dodah.com/situation/
   and/or
 c:/apache/htdocs/dodah/publicdocs/
 
 I hope I have made more sense... Sorry for any confusion.
 Ive been using Apache since the 1.3b3 release and have
 become fairly proficient with the config of it. Thats why
 I made the PR when I found a discrepancy from one ver
 to another.  I do in fact understand where and when the
 trailing "/" was needed, just the rules changed on me.  :)
 
 Thanks,
 Andrew
