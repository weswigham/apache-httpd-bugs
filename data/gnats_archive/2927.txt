>Description:
A CGI script, when in a user directory, but owned by another user and group, will
produce the error "Premature end of script headers:".

Example, user foo maintains script my.cgi for user bar. The file my.cgi is world
executable but is owned by user/group foo:foo. Changing user/group of my.cgi to 
bar:bar fixes this problem.

If you are curious, the script's header is perfectly correct. These scripts and 
their owner settings functioned with earlier versions of Apache. The problem
showed up with the recent upgrade to 1.3.1.

I was tipped off by this problem when I noticed that scripts that weren't 
functioning in user directories did function in the root dir. I can only assume
that rootdir dosen't care about owner when executing.

This occurs in scripts as simple as 'hello world' and more complicated ones. It 
occurs in both C and Perl scripts. Scripts are fully executable under the 
webserver user (nobody) when done via shell.
>How-To-Repeat:
Take a scrip in a user directory and change it's user and group and try to access it.
>Fix:
Allow world readable files of other users to be viewed. Or, if you wish to deny 
access, change the log error to a more descriptive response. This was a PAIN to
figure out. It may be a reason that you are getting some of these CGI problem 
posted to you.

If you take a look, I think you will find that you installed
1.3.1 with suexec.  As outlined very clearly in the suexec
docs, scripts must be owned by the user whose home directory
they are in or suexec will refuse to execute them and give
an error in the suexec log, in the location that you setup
when you installed it.

 Thank you for the quick reply.
 
 Upon further inspection, I am indeed running suexec (I had expected for it to
 be listed in the output of httpd -l, but silly me, it wasn't) So I made a
 stupid mistake, and reported as a bug that was my own fault for running an
 RPM (apache-1.3.1-1.rpm) without fully knowing how it was configured.
 
 You are correct, it is outlined very clearly in the suexec docs. Two
 sentences comprising the last paragraph buried in the 'Enabling & Disabling
 suEXEC' discuss this concern specifically.
 
 However I feel that it is outlined very poorly in both the log error and in
 the FAQ. Any sensible search of the documentation will send an average user
 directly to FAQ question #14 'What does it mean when my CGIs fail with
 "Premature end of script headers"?' Which outlines a few ideas but makes no
 mention that Suexec would produce this error.
 
 Combining the undescriptive error and the matching FAQ response, your
 average user is most likely going to end up at the CGI homepage verifying
 that their headers are perfect and not even remotely considering what may
 be the problem (improper user/gid).
 
 Perhaps a note in the FAQ or a better log error would be warrented?
