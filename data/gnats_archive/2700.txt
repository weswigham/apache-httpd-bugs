>Description:
I have a FreeBSD box whose ifconfig is:
ed0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
        inet 208.239.113.131 netmask 0xfffffff8 broadcast 208.239.113.135
        inet 208.239.113.166 netmask 0xffffffe0 broadcast 208.239.113.191
        ether 00:00:c0:3c:a6:80 
208.239.113.131 is www.dmumford.com
208.239.113.166 is pud.dmumford.com

This box straddles a firewall. `hostname` returns "pud.dmumford.com".

There are no virtual servers running, so httpd is listening to both interfaces.


The problem is that if you do a request like "GET /foo", but "foo" is a
directory, the web server forwards the request to the machine's hostname, not
the machine name used to get to the page.

For example:
dmumford@universe$ telnet www.dmumford.com 80
Trying 208.239.113.131...
Connected to www.dmumford.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /test HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 24 Jul 1998 11:46:06 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.1 (Unix)
Location: http://pud.dmumford.com/test/
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>301 Moved Permanently</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Moved Permanently</H1>
The document has moved <A HREF="http://pud.dmumford.com/test/">here</A>.<P>
</BODY></HTML>
Connection closed by foreign host.
dmumford@universe$



In my opinion, it would be more correct if it forwarded this to 
http://www.dmumford.com/test/ (rather than pud).

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
A workaround is probably to use virtual servers, but I haven't tried that yet.

State-Changed-Why:
No, what Apache does now is perfectly correct.  It uses
the name you have configured for the machine, or the
ServerName directive if one exists.  It can't magically
know what hostname the client accessed in a request such
as the one you list.

If you want it to try, then set the UseCanonicalName directive
to off; see the docs for details.
