HP-UX 9.04 (apache 1.3.6), HP-UX 10.20 (apache 1.3.2)
>Description:
It's really minor, but I've compiled apache 1.3.2 and 1.3.6 on HP-UX, and for whatever reason the configure scripts wants apaci in the helpers directory when Configure executes the eval $(MAKE) etc for dummy.
(in the  "+ doing sanity check on compiler and options" phase of the config). Using HP's c89 compiler.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Linking apaci into the src/helper from the src directory seems to do the tric,. since apaci isn't unlinked between configures.
