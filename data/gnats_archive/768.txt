The server stalls for up to 20 minutes, in 1.2b7, 1.2b8 and 1.2.0.
I think 1.1.1 was OK. I don't have multiple Listen ports, and
USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is defined in conf.h

SIGUSR1 seems to fix it, too.

State-Changed-Why:
You're probably going to have to take this to a linux newsgroup ...
some suggestions:

- upgrade to 1.2.13 (or even upgrade to 2.0.x)
- try adding -DHAVE_SHMGET and making sure you have SysV IPC compiled
  into your kernel

Thanks for using Apache!
