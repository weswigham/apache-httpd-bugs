>Environment:
(1) DEC AlphaServer 1000, Digital Unix 4.0f, JDK 1.2.1, JSDK 2.0
(2) Sun SPARCstation 10, Solaris 2.6, JDK 1.2.2, JSDK 2.0
>Description:
I was unable to use servlets on any port other than the default 8007 while testing
code on my Solaris workstation.  Everything else worked, so I just shrugged it off.<p>

However, when I moved the code over to the production system and tried to build it,
the DEC C compiler whinged about the definition of the static const char null_b[2]
in the ajpv12_sendnbytes() function in jserv_ajpv12.c, saying that the string value 
was too long by 5 bytes.<p>

Bonus: running servlets on a non-default port now works.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile using the DEC C compiler on an AlphaServer running Digital Unix 4.0f.
>Fix:
Change definition from:<p>

static const char null_b[2] = "\xff\xff";<p>

to:<p>

static const char null_b[2] = { 0xff, 0xff };
