>Description:
The file JServDefs.java doesn't compile in this distribution.
The constants PACKAGE, VERSION and TURBO are not defined.
See the following code :
>How-To-Repeat:
<pre>
public interface JServDefs {
    
    /**
     * Defines the name of the package.
     */
ApacheJServ
    
    /**
     * Defines the current version of the package.
     */
1.0
    
    /**
     * Enables or disables TURBO flag. If this flag is turned on,
     * the application is compiled for maximum performance.
     */
true

    /**
     * Enables or disables the PROFILE flag. If this flag is turned
     * on, the application is compiled to allow profiling.
     *
     * The default is false.
     */
    public static final boolean PROFILE = false;
}

</pre>
>Fix:
<PRE>
public interface JServDefs {
    
    /**
     * Defines the name of the package.
     */
    public static final String PACKAGE = "ApacheJServ";
    
    /**
     * Defines the current version of the package.
     */
    public static final double VERSION = 1.0;
    
    /**
     * Enables or disables TURBO flag. If this flag is turned on,
     * the application is compiled for maximum performance.
     */
    public static final boolean TURBO = true;

    /**
     * Enables or disables the PROFILE flag. If this flag is turned
     * on, the application is compiled to allow profiling.
     *
     * The default is false.
     */
    public static final boolean PROFILE = false;
}
