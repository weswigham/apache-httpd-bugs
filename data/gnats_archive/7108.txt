 POLLUTION ALERT!
 Saturday Guardian 2001
 
 
 Britain is suffering the worst air pollution episode since 1991 and
 thousands of elderly people and asthmatics are at risk over the weekend
 the department of the environment warned last night.
 
 The high pressure of the past week has allowed traffic and power station
 pollutants to concentrate to dangerous levels- conditions, which are
 expected to increase hospital admissions and bring premature of deaths of
 people suffering lung problems. 
 
 Last time conditions were so bad in December 1991 deaths rose 10% on
 London during four days. 
 
 Advice: Stay in and take a breath of pure oxygen.
