>Environment:
SunOS 5.7 Generic_106541-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
java version "1.1.7" 
>Description:
If start() gets an IOException it'll invoke the fail() method which tests
log.active.  However, log is not assigned until after the code that causes
the IOException.  See code segment below:


    static synchronized void start() {

        // Load configuration parameters
        try {
            confs = new Configurations(new ExtendedProperties(confFile));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            fail("Error while reading configuration file", e);
        }

        // Create log/trace writer
        log = new JServLog("log", confs);   
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove the configuration file and restart the server.
>Fix:
Initialize log before confs is read.  Then reiintialize afterwards.
