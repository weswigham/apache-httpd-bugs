>Environment:
Linux 2.0.33 (base system: RedHat 5, has latest RedHat patches) on a AMD K6. Compiler: GCC 2.7.2.3.
>Description:
When including the following line in a .shtml file, the browser responds with "Document contains no data":
<!--#include file="/x"-->

(Altough not very relevant: /x exists and is readable.)

From the error log:
[notice] httpd: caught SIGSEGV, attempting to dump core in /usr/local/httpd

No core is in /usr/local/httpd

Apache as such keeps running.

In Apache 1.2.5, the same situation would result in the following:
In the user agent, there would be a message saying "[an error occurred while processing this directive]" at the part of the web-page corresponding to the inclusion and there would be an error log entry saying "unable to include file..."
>How-To-Repeat:
No example URL, as I think that it would be rather useless, but I can create one, if needed.
>Fix:
Something must be wrong with the error handling in case someone (by mistake) tries including a file, using the full path in connection with the INCLUDE FILE=... element.
