>Environment:
Win95/NT VC++ 5.0
>Description:
strcat() on line 3197 of mod_rewrite.c is programmed to take four parameters.  Under Microsoft C strcat() can only take two parameters.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile the file using VC++ 5.0
>Fix:
I know a fix has been suggested for this using strcat() twice to successively concatenate the strings on top of each other, but I think it would be neater (and possibly more efficient) to use sprintf() instead:

sprintf(pCommand, "%s /C %s", SHELL_PATH, cmd);

This keeps it all in one statement on one line and (possibly) reduces run-time overhead very slightly (excuse me if the only advantage is programming style). :o)

PLEASE do as we ask and search the bugdb before submitting

 I apologize for skimming the report too quickly and assuming it was the
 same as the 304 other dumb ones. No insult was intended. 
 
 The patch that was actually applied, as is present in the patch directory,
 does use sprintf (well, it was fixed after the fact to use ap_snprintf).
