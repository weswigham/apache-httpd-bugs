>Description:
Is there anybody (I'm sure there is somebody!), who knows where System.out and 
System.err are routed to. I don't find any output on the console nor in 
any log files.

>How-To-Repeat:
System.out.println("I'm sure, you have the answer without repeating the problem.");
>Fix:
An entry in a servlet zone properties file would be nice, where I can redirect
the output to a file or whatever i want.

State-Changed-When: Mon Feb  1 10:16:26 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug... Servlets are not supposed to write data thru
System.err or System.out streams.
The log() method of ServletContext is provided for these purposes.
