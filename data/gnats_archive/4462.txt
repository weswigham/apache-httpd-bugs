Apache 1.3.6
Jserv 1.0b4 (compiled in, not DSO)
>Description:
Trying to send a file to the servlet by using a form 
with "input type = file".

If the "file" field is not left blank (ie. points to a 
valid file) the server returns the "Internal Server Error"
page and writes this error the the jserv error log:
  (EMERGENCY) ajp11: cannot scan servlet headers

I am successfully using doPost with the same test case
using Sun's JavaWebServer v1.1.3 on an NT box.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a form to post that has an input field of type "FILE".
Create a simple servlet that supports doPost.
If the form sends a FILE, you will see the server error and jserv log entry.
If you leave the FILE input blank you don't get an error.
See the jserv log file for:
  (EMERGENCY) ajp11: cannot scan servlet headers
