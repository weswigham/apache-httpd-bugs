>Description:
The JServInputStream class is missing a method.  Since it's based on
the InputStream class, it *must* override the available method.  Otherwise,
the default implementation merely returns a 0.

Not incidentally, I already submitted this bug last week and it &&^%@#
and now I can't find it anywhere.  So it looks like this program lost my
bug report.  Not good...
>How-To-Repeat:
That should be obvious by now.  Call the method and see what I mean.
>Fix:
Add this method:

public int available()
{
  return( (int)available );
}

Since the method definition in InputStream returns an int, you probably want
to make the internal available variable an int also to avoid the ugly cast.

 Hmmm...for the latest source, we are not using this class anymore. We are
 using Ajpv12InputStream now. This extends BufferedInputStream. I don't see
 anything in the 1.2 javadocs that says that we must override this method.
 
 On top of it, I don't see anywhere in the current code that we are using
 this method.

 I'm sorry. Thanks for re-submitting.
