State-Changed-Why:
The bugs database is not for configuration questions.

Check your error log.  Check to make sure your public_html
directory and all directories above it are world readable and executable.
If you can't make it work, your question is more appropriate
to somewhere like the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
newsgroup.
