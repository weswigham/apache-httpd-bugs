 Erm... why?  Just because we have log levels is no reason to go crazy and
 start logging messages for every little thing.  Many servers use IfModule
 for a reason: because they have different server binaries using the same
 config file.  I'm not sure it makes sense to fill logs with fluff.  I
 think that if someone is using IfModule they should know what they are
 doing, so they deserve what they get; there is no need to complicate the
 base config files like this.
