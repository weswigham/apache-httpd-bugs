Text of .htaccess for above URL is:
AuthUserFile /usr/local/www/private/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName Please Enter you password for this private directory
AuthType Basic

<Limit GET>
require valid-user

State-Changed-Why:
Make sure your AuthName argument is contained within quotes
if it has spaces, e.g

AuthName "Please Enter you password for this private directory"

I have no idea how this could be platform-specific but it's
probably worth fixing.  Let us know if this solves your 
problem.
