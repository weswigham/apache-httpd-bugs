Linux sos 2.0.0 #2 Tue Jun 11 11:22:23 CDT 1996 i486
Slackware.
>Description:
Yesterday, at around 17:00, the ethernetwork in our building
got disconnected. At around 12:00 today, it was repaired. I think
at exactly this time, apache started to log the following sentence
about 750 times each second (!):
[Tue May 12 12:05:32 1998] accept: (client socket): Socket operation on non-socket
until the disk was full. (didn't take a long time at this pace).
Killing the responsible process solved the problem.

State-Changed-Why:
Please upgrade to 1.2.6.  This should fix your problem.
In reality, the problem is probably a bug in the Linux
kernel.  1.2.6 works around it.

Note that you would probably be well advised to update to
a more recent Linux kernel, since yours is quite old.
