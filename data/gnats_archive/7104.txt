 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
 WHY IS THIS POSSIBLE?
 There are many mail-order companies who want to expand their business, bu=
 t do
 not want to hire more people.  If they hired more employees, they would h=
 ave
 to supervise them, rent more office space, pay more taxes and insurance, =
 all
 involving more paperwork.  It is much easier for them to set it up so tha=
 t
 independent homeworkers can earn money doing the work themselves.
 
 This program is designed to help people cash in with a company who needs
 homeworkers.  Each member is an independent homeworker. You serve a compa=
 ny
 that pays good commissions to have their circulars mailed.  This program =
 has
 been perfected so that it has become one of the most successful and profi=
 table
 ones ever.
 
 We invite you to take part in our success.  The money you earn is up to y=
 ou. =
 
 We do not require that you mail a certain number of pieces each week.  Yo=
 u can
 take on whatever amount of business that fits your schedule, and you can =
 quit
 whenever you want, there are no obligations. This work mainly consists of=
  the
 securing of envelopes.
 
 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
 You may work in the comfort of your own home, choose your own hours, and =
 set
 your own pace.  No need to leave your present job.  The possibilities are=
 
 unlimited - get the whole family to join in.  Form workshops with your
 friends.  We will further show you how to expand your operation and boost=
  your
 new income as high as you wish to go.
 
 NOW, IT'S ALL UP TO YOU!
 The opportunity for the better life is here - it's waiting!  But only YOU=
  can
 take that all-important step that separates the achievers from the dreame=

 sold today.  We recommend that you avoid them.  Why fool with some
 questionable scheme when our program enables you to earn so much money

 ars.

 ntees
 you can work with us as long as desired.  You will not be required or ask=
 ed to
 pay for any additional information or manuals.  Inasmuch as we would like=
  to
 send you our program with the small charge, we must protect ourselves fro=
 m
 those who are not serious and have no intention other than to satisfy the=
 ir
 own curiosity.  Naturally, no business can afford to send out costly mate=
 rial

 at
 you are serious about wanting to earn money at home.
