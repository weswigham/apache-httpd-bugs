>Description:
The new serialization options (sysvsem, pthreads, uslock) need to be
documented in PORTING.  The new option SAFE_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT needs to be
documented in PORTING.

IRIX tuning docs need to mention that USE_USLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is two
orders of magnitude faster than the default (sysvsem) on multiprocessor
machines.

Need to put a big warning somewhere about sysvsem and the potential DoS
attack involving it.  Should also mention "ipcs -s" and "ipcrm" to clean up
in the rare cases where the server bombs without ditching its semaphore.
