>Environment:
Any OS, problem in Java code
>Description:
It seems like the domain set for the session cookie in
JServServletManager.createSession() is invalid. At least the
cookie is not accepted by Netscape Communicator 4.04 when
the Servlet is requested with an IP address as the host part.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try creating a session, with HttpServletRequest.getSession(true) when
a Servlet is requested through a URL with an IP address, e.g.
http://127.0.0.1/servlet/TestServlet
>Fix:
If there's no special reason for setting the domain that I'm
not aware of I suggest removing the setDomain() call from
createSession() so that the default is used.
