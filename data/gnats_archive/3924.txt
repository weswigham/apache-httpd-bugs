Hi--

I too am still experiencing the problem.
The problem seems to be solaris 2.6 specific.

I've not tried the fix you asked about --I'll go read up on
it--
but at this point I'm at a loss as to how to overcome the
problem --my current suspicion is that the bugs may be due
to a bad implementation of the largefile related routines in
solaris 2.6--
reason for this conjecture--

solaris 2.5 appears not to have the trouble --and also has
no lstat64 defined

2) solaris 2.6 does have the problem

3) /usr/proc/bin/pstack on the hung processes shows that
   they are hanging on lstat64

I've tried the following with no success:

clear_locks on the hanging nfs server--

	I noticed that you had registered the following bug number in the
database. I am also having similar problems with Apache 1.3.4 on Solaris
2.6. The majority of our files are served off of NFS from a NetApp. At
least once or twice a week I end up with Apache children that can't be
killed and end up having to reboot the machine. I was wondering if you
had been able to uncover anything else since your last message to Apache
bugs?
	I was also wondering if you had tried the "LockFile" recommendation in
http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1977 ?
	Thank you for your time.
