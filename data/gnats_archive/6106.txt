>Description:
the apache*.asc signature files -- the ones that i tried, which included the 1.3.12 one as well as a 2.0aX one -- are not actually accessible.  the browser reports a communications problem when i tried to fetch them.  perhaps they're not readable by the apache server?

given the recent security problems w/ dataloss.net, having usable PGP signatures would be a big plus.
>How-To-Repeat:
go to the download page.  try downloading any of the .asc files.
>Fix:
chmod +r *.asc
