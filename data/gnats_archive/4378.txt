[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!
>Unformatted:
Hi there, I've seen this email-addy used on the www.apache.org webages.

I'm having a problem with Netscape actuully displaying the web page, instead
it brings up the wource of the page rather. I've read some info on the pages
reagrding Netscape (which there isn't alot of). Anyways, how do one fix this
problem?

With 'browsermatch' -arg?

Regards
Mauritz Botha
