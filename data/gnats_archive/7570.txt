Rather basic FreeBSD 4.2-STABLE environment, syncronized like 40 days ago.

All the data is on local HDD disk.
>Description:
The site is running 500-600 simultaneous users (httpd processes) on P3-500/512 MB.

Normally everything runs smooth.  However, once a week there is a scheduled
log resolving event; about 1 GB worth of access logs are being resolved.

When this begins, master httpd process reproducibly dies with:

[Mon Apr 16 08:30:11 2001] [emerg] (9)Bad file descriptor: flock: LOCK_EX: Error getting accept lock. Exiting!
[Mon Apr 16 08:30:12 2001] [alert] Child 88208 returned a Fatal error... 

This should not be an issue with network buffers, or the like as there is ample capacity left:

# netstat -m
6320/12496/65536 mbufs in use (current/peak/max):
        5363 mbufs allocated to data
        957 mbufs allocated to packet headers
5068/10094/16384 mbuf clusters in use (current/peak/max)
23312 Kbytes allocated to network (47% of mb_map in use)
0 requests for memory denied
0 requests for memory delayed
0 calls to protocol drain routines

LockFile is not defined in httpd.conf; this should not be a problem here though.

The apache is compiled using FreeBSD ports collection defaults (except for HARD_SERVER_LIMIT=1024), significantly:
--
 -D HAVE_MMAP
 -D USE_MMAP_SCOREBOARD
 -D USE_MMAP_FILES
 -D USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
 -D SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT
--

For the log-resolving process, jdresolve (http://freshmeat.net/projects/jdresolve/).
>How-To-Repeat:
Might be difficult.

A lot of requests + very heavy non-apache -related traffic (e.g. DNS lookups 50/sec parallelized) might do the trick.
>Fix:
I'm testing whether -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT instead of FLOCK
would do the trick, but if it works, there might be a more widespread
problem afoot.

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure you simply aren't running the box out of file descriptors with your log resolver?  It doesn't seem likely that this problem is related very much to Apache; it normally works fine, then when you run some resource intensive other process, it has trouble getting resources.  The obvious conclusion would be that this other program is using up "too many" of some type of resource for your particular kernel config, thereby causing problems for other processes.

 I find this rather unprobable, as I'd seem to have a lot of free
 descriptors.  Currently the resolver is running with about 600 apache
 processes:
 
 # sysctl -a | grep files
 kern.maxfiles: 16424
 kern.maxfilesperproc: 16424
 kern.openfiles: 1870
 
 So, it'd appear that there should be _a lot_ of free file descriptors
 available.
 
 For what it's worth, the load is rather high (should affect anything,
 though):
 
 last pid:  3633;  load averages:  1.96,  2.25,  2.35
 up 54+10:53:07  11:17:22
 
 Any more ideas what might be wrong (or a way to reliably narrow the
 problem down more)?

 This also occurred when we moved to a new high-performance server.  The
 log resolving didn't occur there yet.
 
 When I changed apache to use USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT, it has now run
 with 500-700 processes around the clock without any problems for two
 weeks.
 
 It appears that FCNTL may work better than FLOCK at least for FreeBSD 4.3.
