SunOS www 4.1.3 3 sun4c
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
A LogFormat line with an empty format string like

LogFormat "" null

on line 86 of httpd.conf produces the error message

Syntax error on line 86 of /www/conf/httpd.conf:
LogFormat takes 1-2 arguments, a log format string (see docs) and an optional format name

I think it should be possible to have an empty format.

State-Changed-Why:

An empty format would result in a logfile full of blank
lines, one for each request logged -- which isn't very
useful at all.  This would be a misfeature IMO.

If you want no logging information written,
direct the logfile to /dev/null (or nul, for Win32).

If you can provide some sort of justification for a file
full of blank lines, I'll re-open this PR.  Thanks
for taking the time to open it, and for using Apache.

 Ken,
 
 it's not a question of usefulness.  It's a syntax problem.  
 Otherwise you should mention this limitation in the documentation.
