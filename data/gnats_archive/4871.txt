>Description:
When a valid .htaccess file is placed in a directory with intended protection, the server still serves the pages. Example .htaccess file:
Authtype Basic
AuthName "Ta see it sign in"
AuthUserFile /usr/pass/redpasswd
<Limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</Limit>

The /usr/pass/redpasswd is in place and configured with htpasswd.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try http://www.lagmonster.org/~sam/ and all of the subdirectories under this site SHOULD require this authentication. If it prompts for you, use name: apache password: test

>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Wed May  3 12:56:50 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Remove the <Limit> and </Limit> directives.  If this
directory is within the scope of a Satisfy Any directive,
add Satisfy All to the .htaccess file.  And upgrade to
a current version of Apache; 1.3.6 is quite old and had
several auth-related bugs in it.
