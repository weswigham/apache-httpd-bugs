SunOS athena 5.7 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc
>Description:
This is similar to a problem I reported and was corrected for an
earlier version. I have host-based virtual hosts configured, and the
ErrorDocument directive for the first virtual host defined is being
used for all virtual hosts.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.netlondon.com/  and enter a search term and submit. It won't
find it, and instead of returning a 404 error page for netlondon, it
returns the ErrorDocument for snpp.com, which is the first defined
VirtualHost in the httpd.conf.
>Fix:
It may be as simple as reapplying the original fix, perhaps it got lost in
an RCS revision? Thanks in any case. -Gary
