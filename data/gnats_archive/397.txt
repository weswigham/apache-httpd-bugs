>Environment:
HP-UX 10.10, HP ANSI C compiler
>Description:
httpd: caught SIGSEGV is appearing in the log files of both 1.1.3 and 1.2b8.
It appears to be related to operation, not time.

The server continues to run, and the users are not noticing any difficulty.

Only basic HTML and CGI is accessible at the site, and the error comes up when
accessing basic HTML.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, this is a internal web site, and is not accessible from outside 
my employer's network.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you please examine the core file and tell us what the
backtrace says?  (See the FAQ at <http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ>
if you need instructions.)  Without that kind of information,
there isn't much of a possibility that we'll be able to
identify the problem area.

We're quite close to releasing the final version of 1.2,
so if you could get this information to us quickly we may
be able to fix it before release.

State-Changed-Why:
Customer says:
"Actually, I've solved the problem.  The HP ANSI C compiler appears to have
a flawed optimization.  Turning off optimization cured the problem."

Thanks for the update, and for using Apache!
