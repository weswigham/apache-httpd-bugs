BSD/OS 3.0 (patched current as of report date);
Apache 1.2.0 compiled using gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Given an srm.conf Alias (hence categorized, perhaps incorrectly, as a
"mod_alias" problem) statement of the form

Alias /images/ /var/www/images/

a relative reference such as <IMG SRC="images/logo.gif">, a valid reference
within a <VirtualHost> block's DocumentRoot hierarchy results in attempted
display of '/var/www/images/logo.gif', as indicated by ErrorLog entries of
the form

 [date] access to /var/www/images/logo.gif failed for {hostname},
 reason: File does not exist 

This does not appear to be a problem other than within <VirtualHost>s.  I
do not know if this "new behavior" is present in all 1.2bX versions -- this
server jumped directly from release 1.1.3 to 1.2.0.

 Let's see if I can briefly clarify...
 
 If I've defined in srm.conf
 
  Alias /images/ /var/www/images/
 
 then I would expect any reference, anywhere on the server (VirtualHost or 
 otherwise) to <SRC="/images/whatever.jpg"> to indeed expand and use file 
 /var/www/images/whatever.jpg
 
 However, if we leave off the preceding "/", <SRC="images/whatever.jpg">, 
 the alias should no longer be expanded, because this is a *relative* path, 
 relative to the current working directory (aka "./images/whatever.jpg").
 
 This is how it has worked in all Apache versions <= 1.1.3 I've ever used.
 
 In 1.2, however, I am still seeing the expected behavior in UserDir 
 hierarchies (http://www.sfo.com/~user = ~user/public_html), but within 
 <VirtualHost> hierarchies
 
  DocumentRoot /usr/home/user/public_html
 
 even relative references are being expanded by the global Alias 
 definition.  If we call up the same exact VirtualHost site using the 
 ~user/public_html URL format (physical location is identical), all works 
 as expected.
 
 (Note that I am not referring to an Alias defined within a <VirtualHost> 
 block -- the Alias is defined only in srm.conf.)
 
 In other words, I would expect that
 
   <SRC="/images/whatever.jpg">
   <SRC="images/whatever.jpg">
 
 would point to two diffent places, but they do not.  This is happening 
 *only* within <VirtualHost>s and is definitely a change from previous 
 behavior.  (Believe me, since we've always instructed folks to use 
 relative paths here, this affected many sites and we began hearing from 
 these VirtualHost customers within hours of the switchover.)
 
 It is very easy to reproduce (at least here in our environment): 
 
  - simply map a <VirtualHost> onto an existing UserDir site, and add
    an srm.conf Alias with the same name as a uniquely-named
    subdirectory within the site
 
  - <SRC="subdirectory/file"> will pull up just fine from an html
    reference when the site is called by UserDir URL, but will fail
    (in attempt to find expanded <SRC="/subdirectory/file">) if called
    up by VirtualHost URL.
 
 If need be, I can set up a test site here to demonstrate.

 I'm still confused --  SRC="images/whatever.jpg" is a relative URL which
 the *client* translates to a full URL before passing to the server.
 So apache never sees a relative request.
 
 If you have Alias /images/ /var/www/images/ in your srm.conf then every
 single vhost inherits that setting.  Perhaps you don't want it in your
 global server.
 
 Are you saying that if someone accesses http://vhost/images/foobar.gif it
 does the wrong thing?

 That's what we've had to do to work around the "problem".  But, as I say, 
 using identical definitions in srm.conf, this only appeared during the 
 switch from 1.1.3 to 1.2.
 
 To put it another way, srm.conf and httpd.conf remained essentially static 
 (apart from required changes) during the upgrade.  The variable was the 
 apache binary.

 Exactly.  *IF* the URL is specified by *relative* path "images/foobar.gif" 
 within the site's HTML.  If the HTML is coded using full http:// URLs 
 instead of relative paths, all works fine.
 
 Take these two hypothetical URLs
 
   http://www.host.com/~vuser/images/foobar.gif
   http://www.vhost.com/images/foobar.gif
 
 They are one and the same -- vhost DocumentRoot is ~vuser/public_html 
 (full path spelled out, of course).
 
 Now, we have a relative reference in index.html <SRC="images/foobar.gif">.
 
 Browsing the first, all works fine.  Browsing the second results in an 
 attempt to load
 
   http://www.host.com/images/foobar.gif
 
 Note "host" versus "vhost".  With vhost DocumentRoot set to 
 ~vuser/public_html, the client should be doing a translation of
 
   images/foobar.gif
   --> vhost/images/foobar.gif
   --> host/~vuser/public_html/images/foobar.gif
 
 instead we're seeing
 
   host/images/foobar.gif
 
 Am I making it any clearer?  I'm not sure I can come up with any more ways 
 to describe this :-) -- let me know if I need to set up another server to 
 demonstrate the behavior in action.

 My apologies -- this last sentence is incorrect.
 
 I have set up a rudimentary site which should demonstrate the differences 
 in behavior:
 
  http://www.newsgate.com
  http://amanda.sfo.com/~newsgate
 
 They are one and the same.  I have included links to both srm.conf and 
 httpd.conf, so that you can inspect things yourself.
 
  uniquename is an Alias in srm.conf
  uniquename2 is not
 
 (Please let me know when you feel you no longer need that up -- it is, as 
 you'll see, a live server and in my haste I've exposed items which would 
 not normally ever be visible to non-staff.)

State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sun Nov  9 01:44:47 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Sorry I took so long to close this one out.  Apache is behaving
correctly.

<img src="images/foo.gif"> is a relative URL which the client
translates into an absolute URL before sending the request to
the server.  Suppose this tag is embedded in a page at
http://www.vhost.com/index.html.  In that case, the relative
"images/foo.gif" is mapped to the absolute
"http://www.vhost.com/images/foo.gif".

This results in the URI "/images/foo.gif", which is properly
Aliased by your global Alias directive.

i.e. in this case <img src="/images/foo.gif"> and
<img src="images/foo.gif"> refer to the exact same object.

Regarding your other example, in ~userdir situations, the
relative URL "images/foo.gif" refers to the absolute URI
"/~userdir/images/foo.gif" which is definately different
than "/images/foo.gif".

Your only options are to not use "images" URIs in vhosts,
or to remove the global Alias /images.
