Solaris 2.6 patch 105181-11
GCC 2.8.1
>Description:
When I compile Apache 1.3.9 with -DHIGH_SLACK_LINE=256, my CGI cannot be run

In error log :
Premature end of script header

When I run a Intershop CGI i have more log :
Could not complete sending response (fflush)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I had the same problem with mod_php3 and I patch mod_php3.c to
replace ap_popenf by ap_pfopen. Because php3 use fdopen on file descriptors 
whose values are not be less than 255 (cause bug on solaris).
