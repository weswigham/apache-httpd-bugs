NT 4.0 SP4 Workstation
>Description:
When I first installed Apache, there was an icon in the program group titled 'Apache Install as Service'. While I thought this would install it as a service it didn't - choosing this icon did nothing more than bring the My Computer window to the front.

In checking the icon, it turns out that it's doing just what it was set up to do. The icon in the program group is nothing more than a shortcut to My Computer.

So, I followed the instructions at www.apache.org/docs/windows.html and installed it as a service from the commmand line.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache 1.3.9 and try to use the shortcut to install apache as a service.
>Fix:
Create the correct shortcut in the program group to run 'apache -i -n' from the correct subdirectory where apache was installed.
