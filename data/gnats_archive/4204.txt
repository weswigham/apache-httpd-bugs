>Description:
I have the following in my httpd.conf in /usr/local/etc/apache

<extract>
UserDir web-docs 

#
# Control access to UserDir directories.  The following is an example
# for a site where these directories are restricted to read-only.
#
<Directory /*/web-docs>
    AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit 
    Options +MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch +IncludesNOEXEC +Indexes
    FancyIndexing on
    <Limit GET POST OPTIONS PROPFIND>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Limit>
    <Limit PUT DELETE PATCH PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
    </Limit>
</Directory>

</extract>

Yet when I try to view a a directory with no index.html in it I get the message
"You don't have permission to access /~anyusernameItry/" If Ihave a index.html in the web-docs dir i can view the file

The error message I get in httpd-error-log is
[Wed Apr  7 09:05:56 1999] [error] [client 196.31.1.34] Directory index forbidden by rule: /home/bradh/web-docs/

State-Changed-Why:

This is working correctly.  Your <Directory> container:

  <Directory /*/web-docs>

doesn't match the directory in question:

  /home/bradh/web-docs/

Try "<Directory /*/*/web-docs>" instead.
