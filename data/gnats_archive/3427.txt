>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.2.7
>Description:
In mod_mime.c structure array hash_buckets has 27 elements. When locale
is set to national language, is_alpha returns "true" not only for [A-Z,a-z]
and hash() may be > 27. In function find_ct:
" || (type = ap_table_get(hash_buckets[hash(*ext)], ext))) { "
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
is out of memory.
>How-To-Repeat:
Access to file "any.русский.html"
>Fix:
1. Increase MIME_HASHSIZE to 258 :-)
2. Fix hash()
3. Start apache with environment setting locale to C
