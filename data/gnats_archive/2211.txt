>Environment:
Windows 95b OSR2.1 with USB support and Windows NT Workstation 4.0 with Service Pack 3 (Build 1381)

Apache came in the pre-compiled exe format
>Description:
When installing Apache 1.3b6 from the self-extracting EXE file, the installation will install Apache Web Server into the designated directory. When it copies the ICONS directory, it should be placed in ../htdocs instead of the main APACHE directory.

If you do not do this, any roots that come up as a directory listing, the icons will not come up, causing the client to not know the image is there.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache 1.3b6 onto a Windows 95/NT 4.0 machine into the default directory location and run the server program. Rename the index.html file in the ../htdocs or the root web server directory and refresh the web page. The icons will not show up as it should.
>Fix:
In the setup process, point the installer to copy the ICONS directory into the ../htdocs directory instead of the base installation directory.

State-Changed-Why:
We are trying to keep the Unix and NT distributions as 
similar as possible.  This is one artifact of that 
decision.  The reason icons are separate is partly 
historical, but also because it's a good way to demonstrate
the "Alias" directive, which you can find in the srm.conf-win-dist
file in the distribution.  Give that a whirl.

 I was kind of wondering why the directory wasn't placed into the \htdocs 
 directory. I'll try out the alias setup in the configuration files.
 
 I am just learning how to use Apache and Linux right now.
 
 Thanks

 So why isn't the alias uncommented by default?
