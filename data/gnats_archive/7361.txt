Not my server so I porbablly shouldn't be reporting it but hopefully we can get this fixed

Autoindex will incorrectly display a directory and will creat a never ending loop.  See below for example.  Suggestion: email admin (aryeh@SPAM-aryeh-MAPS.net), he reads slashdot and builds perl modules, i suspect he'd be mroe than willing to assist.
