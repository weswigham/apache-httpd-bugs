Linux 2.0.36 (Redhat 5.2)
>Description:
After installing Apache, upon executing httpd for the first time, I received the error message "LogFormat takes 1-2 arguments, a log format string (see docs) and an optional format name".
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I corrected the httpd.conf file myself by placing backslashes before the inside quotation marks in the LogFormat directives.
The two corrected lines (lines 159 & 160) read as follows:
  LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"{User-Agent}i\"" combined
  LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common

Everything worked fine once I did this.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... they do have '\'s in front of the quotes within
quotes in the distributed conf file.

How did you install Apache?  Did you use some third party
packaged RPM or something, or install from the Apache
source?

 I used the Redhat 5.2 RPM apache-1.3.3-1.src.rpm found on their second
 CD-ROM in the directory /SRPMS.
