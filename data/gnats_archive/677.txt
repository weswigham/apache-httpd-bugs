>Environment:
I am using the gcc 2.7.2 compiler with SOLARIS 2.5.  I am also running into this problem using
the gcc compiler on Linux 2.0 from Redhat.

Solaris uname info:
SunOS aruba.webengine-db.com 5.5 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-LX
>Description:
My C++ code will not compile on Solaris or Linux with the GNU GCC 2.7.2 compiler.

The problem seems to be with the pool declarations that are within a struct.

For example the following will compile:

typedef struct {
    struct pool *pool;
    int elt_size;
    int nelts;
    int nalloc;
    char *elts;
} array_header;

but as it is declared in alloc.h will not (notice the struct declaration in from of pool):

typedef struct {
    pool *pool;
    int elt_size;
    int nelts;
    int nalloc;
    char *elts;
} array_header;

When I added the struct declaration to all headers that refer to pool within a struct
everything compiled fine and it seemed to have no adverse effect on the normal build of the server in C.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try compiling using a source file that ends with .cpp instead of .c
>Fix:
See description of problem above for how I fixed it on my system.  This had to
be added to all header files which declared pool within a struct.
alloc.h, httpd.h http_config.h and buff.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache is written in ANSI C, not C++ (any variant).
Getting it to compile under C++ was not a goal.
However, some work has been done lately in the
area of making it compilable under NT, and it's
likely that the latest version will compile
better (particularly since I remember seeing
a patch recently that affected pool structs).
You can try the latest source snapshot (see
<http://dev.apache.org/>, but this still isn't
really a bug.

Thanks for using Apache!
