>Description:
I know that PHP is no official module but I think that the problem maybe Apache-specific.

I have always enabled the XBitHack-feature. But on our new server-install (xbithack on), x-bit-files are PHP-parsed instead of SSI-parsed! 
PHP is only enabled for .php, but when I enable the xbit of a file, I can write php-code in it and when I call the URL, the php-code is parsed!
On the other hand, the SSI-code in the file is NOT parsed.

What's going on here?

Thanks for your help.
