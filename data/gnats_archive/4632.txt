>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
OS2 Warp 4, revision 9.033 (fixpak9 installed)
>Description:
SUB (hex1A) character causes Apache to fail at startup with the error:

"Syntax error on line nnn of c:/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command '->', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration"

displayed at the command prompt.

Although this is minor, in OS2 it is quite annoying, as the default editors
provided with the OS both seem to stick in the end-of-file SUB character.
>How-To-Repeat:
In OS2, edit the configuration file with the 'E' editor.  Make any
change and save it.  It now will have the end-of-file character as
the last character.
>Fix:
Ignore end-of-file characters in the .conf file, or ignore only if it is the last character.
