>Description:
If a CGI returns a Last-Modified header the server does not run it
through set_last_modified(), and therefore does not do If-Modified-Since
processing on it.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
In scan_script_header_err special case Last-Modified, run parseHTTPDate
on it, and pass it to set_last_modified
