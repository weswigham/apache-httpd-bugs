Linux 2.0.30/GNU
>Description:
I'm building a site where data is stored in database files, and pages 
will be rendered on demand.  Rendering is a compute intensive task.  It struck
me that the ProxyPass function could do load balancing of sorts, if it could 
walk a circular list of identical remote proxies.  ie.

ProxyPass /xyz http://sys1/ http://sys2/ http://sys3/

The database changes minute-by-minute so pre-rendering all the pages isn't
a viable option.  

Is this reasonable?

Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
This feature may be implemented in a future version of
mod_proxy, but currently the rewrite to be HTTP/1.1
compliant has a higher priority.

If you need such a feature now you can use mod_rewrite
which can do such a kind of load balancing
(see http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_rewrite/docs/mod_rewrite/solutions.html#loadbalance)

 I think there's an example in the mod_rewrite documentation or at the
 mod_rewrite site for doing this.

 Yes, I didn't catch the example the first time around.  It looks
 to be a fine, if not better, solution for my problem.  Thanks.
