>Description:
Using the cookie.cgi example which comes with CGI.pm-2.53, no cookie is sent to the browser (which is set up to display a message when a cookie is offered)
Running the script in offline mode generates the following output

# ./cookie.cgi
(offline mode: enter name=value pairs on standard input)
Set-Cookie: animals=; domain=localhost; path=/./cookie.cgi; expires=Thu, 05-Aug-1999 22:51:32 GMT

Btw. The script works fine with Perl 5.002 on RetHat Linux 5.2 with apache 1.3.6

The apache logfile gives no hint ( maxbe not configured correctly ? )

Running the script mentioned above in an AIX environment.
