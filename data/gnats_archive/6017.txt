FreeBSD 3.3-RELEASE #0
>Description:
The documentation indicates that RLimitNPROC, RLimitCPU, and RLimitMEM should be used to limit the resources available to CGI (and SSI) processes spawned by Apache.  However, when using these directives in conjunction with suexec, they seem to have no effect.  The clearest manifestation of this is when someone decides to reload a CGI page 60 times and our entire webserver crashes, an undesirable behavior.

Strangely, when one runs "limits" from the CGI script and dumps the output to screen, the limits are in line with what was set by the RLimit* directives.  But, as indicated, they have no actual effect on the CGI processes.
>How-To-Repeat:
I'd rather not tell you how to take down our server (which I'm sure you could do anyway), but if you were to set up an suexec server with a virtual host that had a CGI script running as a system user (i.e. not root/nobody/www) that did something significant (opened a file, made a database call, loaded a large module), and then hit reload for that page on your browser 20 times, you'd see what I mean.
>Fix:
I don't have one, I'm sorry.  It seems there have been several other folks reporting similar problems, but with no resolution (PR#s 5901, 4551, 3482, etc).  The best general goal I can propose is "make the RLimit directives work with suexec".  If not that, could someone PLEASE just come right out and say "this is a problem we know about", perhaps put it in the documentation?  Thanks.
