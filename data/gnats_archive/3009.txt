>Description:
We have the following config here : our ap)ache proxy acts a a relay between
our clients and other proxies, one of which request a username/password.
The code in modules/proxy/proxy_http.c prevents apache to forward this
information to another host...

My feeling is that the RemoteProxy directive should include a flag telling
if such a field should be transmitted/forgottent. Peharps the ProxyVia directive 
is reserved to do so ???

 Futhermore ('bout proxy balancing / pool of proxy ) : should be interesting
 to be able to log into the access_log file which proxy was used..

 Another improvement could be that when there are many remote proxy for
 allowing to access the outside world, there could be :
 - "spare" proxies (ie: if proxy #1 fails, then try proxy #2...)
 - load balancing on proxies
 ...

 The same problem exists with the CONNECT method. Temporarely Idid the following
 change in proxy_connect.c
 
 126,127d125
 <     array_header *reqhdrs_arr; /* plc */
 <     table_entry *reqhdrs; /* plc */
 229,242c227
 < /***************** Add authorization if known *****************/
 <         reqhdrs_arr = ap_table_elts(r->headers_in);
 <         reqhdrs = (table_entry *) reqhdrs_arr->elts;
 <         for (i = 0; i < reqhdrs_arr->nelts; i++)
 <         {
 <          if (reqhdrs[i].key == NULL || reqhdrs[i].val == NULL
 <              || strcasecmp(reqhdrs[i].key, "Proxy-Authorization") )
 <          {
 <             continue;
 <          }
 <          ap_snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer),
 <                      "Proxy-Authorization: %s" CRLF, reqhdrs[i].val );
 <         }
 <       ap_snprintf(buffer+strlen(buffer), sizeof(buffer)-strlen(buffer),

 Problem : it forward the authorization to every remote proxy... Should keep
 a table of which proxy asked an auth (?)
 
 BTW: shouldn't the User-Agent be sent to ?
