>Description:
I have a dll file which is used to control the signals out to the parallel port. 
I use a java native method to generate this dll file. However, I can't add the 
dll the file in the apache server. The problem is that I cannot control the
signals out to the parallel port of the server when I access my java homepage 
in any client machines. I know that the problem is related to modules, but
I don't familiar with that. CAn u give some instructuion to me?

State-Changed-Why:

What sort of .DLL were you creating?  An ISAPI module?
An Apache module?  This would help us respond to your
question more effectively.

If ISAPI, then you need to review the mod_isapi docs.

If an ApacheModule, see the LoadModule docs.
