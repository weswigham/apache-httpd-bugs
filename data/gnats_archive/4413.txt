>Unformatted:
The argument about filenames with spaces doesn't really apply,  those
spaces would have to be escaped to be handled properly by the shell (if
suexec was off).  The patch would only have to handle escaped spaces.

This brings up an interesting point.  If #exec is parsed by the shell
without suexec it needs to be parsed just the same way with suexec.  This
is especially true since non ~userdir cgis under virtualhosts (or main
servers) without User/Group directives will not run through suexec.
