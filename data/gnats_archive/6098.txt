>Environment:
Windows95
>Description:
Did a binary install on Windows 95.  Everything works fine and am able to uncomment all of the modules in httpd.conf except mod_proxy.  Error message on start up says syntax error on 176 (the LoadModule mod_proxy line) and "Cannot load C:\program files\apache group\apache\modules\ApacheModuleProxy into server."  Line 176 of httpd says "LoadModule proxy_module modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll" and ApacheModuleProxy.dll was installed in the modules directory.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed May 17 23:23:12 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
As already reported in 42 other PRs, the proxy module does not
work on Win95 because certain Win32 features that it requires
are not supported on Win95.
