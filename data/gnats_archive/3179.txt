>Description:
I'd like to see some sort of support for logging proxy requests, or more
accurately, indication of whether the proxy request was satisfied by retrieving the 
page from a remote site, or by pulling it out of the cache.

This would allow me to see how much of a benefit having the caching proxy is
having on network bandwidth utilization.
