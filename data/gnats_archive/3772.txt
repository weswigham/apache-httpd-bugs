Hi

My Name Is Paul and I am A webmaster for about 50 
sites, This is a genuine letter and not spam. I got your 
email address from searching on webcrawler ( webdesign 
). I have recently put up a site www.sub-mit-it.com in direct 
competition to www.submitit.com because I am sick of 
paying there $59-00 subscription fee's. May be you feel 
the same. 

A few webmates and I put a up server using the exact 
same software that the opposition is using the difference is 
we submit to over 1400 engines and directories and only 
charge $29-00 for 12 month suscription .

I am busy building a webmasters lounge for our subs 
which will index  web masters resources and  marketing 
ideas. If you would like a listing give it to me and I'll put 
you up or if you have any contributions as far as ideas go 
let me know. A reciprocal link would be appreciated but 
not necessary

Any way give me a shout and let me know what you think


Have a great day

Regards

Paul Morgan
