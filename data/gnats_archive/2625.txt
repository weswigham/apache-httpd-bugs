>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
HP-UX 9.05 (Series 700 machine)
using HP's ANSI C compiler
>Description:
src/support/ab.c generates compiler warnings with HP's ANSI C under HP-UX 9.05
because select() has been used directly instead of ap_select() (picked up
from conf.h).
>How-To-Repeat:
Need a system where (int *) is used for 2nd/3rd/4th params to select(), rather
than (fdset *). HP-UX 9.X with HP's ANSI C compiler is one such combination.
Note that HP-UX 10.X has reverted to (fdset *) :-)
>Fix:
Change line 554 of src/support/ab.c to:

        n = ap_select(256, &sel_read, &sel_write, &sel_except, &timeout);
