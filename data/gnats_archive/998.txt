>Description:
moving from 1.2b6 to 1.2.1 - 1.2b6 workd fine (except for some problems with
servering PDF files) so I am in the process of trying to upgrade to 1.2.1
the sytem compiles fine and starts fine, even servs the first request fine
after that everyother request hangs.  I have turned keepalive off and
applied the IRIX 5.3 netwoking rollup as recommended in the known bugs
section. (SGI has repackaged the patch as 2098 instead of 1564)

This did not work.  There are no messages in the error log.

lines are:

State-Changed-Why:
In what manner does it hang?  If you try to telnet to
port 8080, does it connect and then sit there or does
it not connect or do you get connection refused?

How many httpd child processes are running when the problem
happens?

Try recompiling with -DNO_SLACK added to your EXTRA_CFLAGS
(and rerun Configure, of course).

Are you using the exact same config files for the two
versions?  (except possibly for the port number which
shouldn't matter)

 just sits there.

 Added -DNO_SLACK

 Did not work.

 Yes.  Everything except for port.
 
 
 
 
 I am about to install the latest IRIX5.3 Jumbo Patch.  I'll let you know what
 the results are after that as well.

 But how many are actually _running_ as shown by a ps?

 8 are actually running. 
 
 
 
 I installed the jumbo patch and it seemed to work.  
 Unfortuantly I installed all the patches at once so I am not sure which patch
 actually took care of the problem (sorry)  if you want I have another 5.3 
 machine where I can install the patches one after the other to find out which
 one(s) actually fixed the problem.
 
 
 Also, it seems to work fine under IRIX 6.2

 If you have a chance and it is easy, I wouldn't mind if you could give
 that a try so we know exactly which one it is, but it isn't necessary;
 easy enough to tell people to install the whole whack.
 
 Can you provide a list of what patches are installed now (or just which
 ones are part of the jumbo patch)?
