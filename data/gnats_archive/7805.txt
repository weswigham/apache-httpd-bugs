>Environment:
Microsoft Windows 2000 Server [Version 5.00.2195], Service Pack 1
>Description:
The MSI package starts and works correctly until I hit the final "Install" button. Then it immediately displays a screen saying that the "Installation Wizard has been interrupted". No files have been installed at all. This is a completely new installation.

Here's the log output of MSIEXEC:

>How-To-Repeat:
You probably can't, but I can :). Various newsgroup posts also relate the exact same problem, btw.
>Fix:
No, sorry, but it would sure be cool if I could dump IIS and switch to Apache.
