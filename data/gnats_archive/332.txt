>Environment:
SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-03 sun4u sparc SUNW, Ultra-2
>Description:
Can you give me pointers as to what I would have to change in the Apache
source in order to get the server to parse SSIs in CGI output?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Have the server recognize a special mime-type, e.g., text/shtml. Alternatively,
is there an existing Perl script  (ideal) or a C program that takes shtml
input and outputs the results after processing SSIs? I dont want to
reinvent the wheel
