>Description:
Nothing serious at all.  I just had to change a header to point to the right
place and recompile.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to compile on my box.  I expect any Linux box built with the September 1996
distribution of Slackware is going to have this problem.
>Fix:
Add something to configure that takes this into account.  Give people the option
of changing where httpd lives in Configuration.  Then, when Configure is run,
the correct path will be used. in the header file.

I don't recall the header file that has it in it, but, if you do a:
grep "/usr/local/etc" *.h
in the src directory, it will be evident which one is in question

Comment-Added:
Thanks for the information, but I'm not sure why you
are reporting it as a bug. If a particular distribution
has placed files in various locations, it is their
responsibility to ensure that the compiled Apache they distribute
accesses the correct locations.

If you are upgrading by compiling Apache from source there
are several ways you can specify the correct locations for your
system. You can start Apache with the -f or -d flag, or if
you want to compile in the correct location use

  EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DHTTPD_ROOT="/...."

in Configuration.

State-Changed-Why:
As Paul said, if whatever distribution you have used wants
to put things in a difference place then it needs to adjust
things.  The way to change this is to edit the .h file,
either directly or by changing your Configuration file.

Apache can't default to doing things the same as every
third party distribution out there, since most of them
do things completely differently.
