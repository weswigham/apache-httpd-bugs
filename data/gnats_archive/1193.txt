Linux 2.0.3 with Apache 1.2.4 with NeoWebscript
>Description:
I can't put new file on the server whith Symposia Doc+. On the other hand it seems to work with Netscape Editor.
See beyond.
>How-To-Repeat:
By using Symposia Doc+ (html editor) i can't do a put on my server when the
directory is protected by a password.
When i do the same with Netscape/Editor ... it works fine !

Symposia is using http 1.1 and Netscape 1.0

When i look at the log file i get this :
{Oct 03 09:50:09} 192.0.2.195 {} {} 404 0 r8m70.cybercable.tm.fr {GET /test.lck ...
{Oct 03 09:50:09} 192.0.2.195 {} {} 401 0 r8m70.cybercable.tm.fr {PUT /test.html ...
{Oct 03 09:50:09} 192.0.2.195 {} {} 401 0 r8m70.cybercable.tm.fr {PUT /test.html ...

I dont get such a thing :
{Oct 03 09:48:52} 192.0.2.195 {} putdoc 200 1 r8m70.cybercable.tm.fr {PUT /test.html ...

The trouble is that it seems to work with other web server like the cern one !!!

Is there a way to trace what appends in Apache when we should get the authentification ?

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure Symposia is using HTTP/1.1?  Are those exact
log entries you quoted?  They have no protocol on them.

It is very unlikely this is Apache's fault.  What you could
do is something like:

   tcpdump -s 64000 -w foo1.out port 80 and host client

where 80 is the port the server is on and client is the
client machine you are using, then attempt, then do
a "strings foo1.out" to get an idea what the client is
sending and the server is replying.  Do this for both
Navigator and Symposia and mail me the output.

Is there anything in the error log?  Are you sure Symposia
handles authentication at all?

 Sorry to give this information only now.
 The problem was solved by Grif a few weeks ago.
 It occurs only when trying to put html files directly under the server root.
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Guy.
