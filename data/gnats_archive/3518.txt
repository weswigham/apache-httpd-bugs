Hi,

I have tried installing Apache 1.3.3 on my Win95 system.  It never seems to finish the installation.  After it claims to be installed, it says "Starting Apache" and nothing ever happens.  I looked for the Httpd file (which I assume is some sort of executable, and is the main program) and it doesn't exist.  Is there something else I have to do? I have installed it twice, and had the same problem with version 1.3.1 and just gave up back then.
>How-To-Repeat:
Re-install on a Win95 machine?
>Fix:
not sure

State-Changed-Why:
What happens when you start the "apache" executable by
hand from the command line?  Is there anything in the error log?

As the message says, you have to set the ServerName
directive in your config file since Apache can't figure out
the name of your server.  See the docs for details.

 Marc,
 
 If I try running apache.exe directly from windows, I get a DOS window that
 flashes quickly.  When I run the program from DOS, this is what I get:
 
 httpd: cannot determine local host name.
 Use the ServerName directive to set it manually.
 
 There is nothing in the error log directory.
 Am I supposed to do something else after running the install file?
 
 thanks,
 Keith

 Marc,
 
 I looked in the configure file, and I find no reference to ServerName.  I
 tried double-clicking the file, and I also tried type "Configure", "%
 Configure", and now I don't know what else to try.  Nothing works.  Could you
 give me a little more detailed explanation of what I'm doing wrong?
 
 Keith
