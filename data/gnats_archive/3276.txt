SunOS infobsun11 5.6 Generic_105181-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
Same symptoms as reported for PR3189. Note that this happens on sunos but not on my RHLinux 5.0 (kernel 2.0.32) system. Apache v1.3.1 worked fine, but versions 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 bomb. Here's the config string I used:

configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max --prefix=/usr/local/apache/
servers/resource

with adb (the only debugger I could run on this system) I got the following stack trace:

strlen(?) + 80
upper_digits.27(0x67fb8,0x4aeb8,0xef62a744,0x4ac00,0x0,0xef7c02ac) + 100ac
ap_add_module(0xef740fcc,0x6a908,0xf,0x0,0x0,0x4aca8) + 3c
ap_add_loaded_module(0xef740fcc,0xef7206f4,0xf,0x0,0x4aca8,0x6a908) + c
load_module(0xeffffa60,0x0,0x6a908,0x6a918,0x176b0,0x0) + 250
invoke_cmd(0x4ad10,0xeffffa60,0x0,0xefffd973,0x81010100,0xff00) + 360
ap_handle_command(0xeffffa60,0x6a678,0xefffd968,0x51c00,0x0,0x0) + 250
ap_srm_command_loop(0xeffffa60,0x6a678,0x631f8,0x0,0x74632f68,0x74632f61) + 5c
ap_process_resource_config(0x6a148,0x63f88,0x6a120,0x6c138,0x1,0xef608024) + 288
ap_read_config(0x6a120,0x6c138,0x63f88,0x63c00,0xef625998,0xef625c24) + 58
main(0x1,0xeffffc24,0xeffffc2c,0x63d4c,0x0,0x0) + 3c0

Note: under solaris adb always shows six parameters.

I tried to figure out how to print the modname (the 3rd) parameter to load_module but couldn't talk adb into cooperating with me. If I configure without shared modules using

configure --enable-module=most --prefix=/usr/local/apache/servers/resource

then it doesn't coredump (at least to the extent that it is able to complain about the LoadModule directive in my httpd.conf file).

>How-To-Repeat:
Try running on a Sun system with DSO.
