>Description:
im pretty convinced ive found a problem or bug in apache 1.3.0 (or 3.3) running
on a fresh copy of redhat 5.2 (kernel 2.0.36-0.7) & the PUT method

im convinced of this becauase before the upgrade, the method & everything worked
 flawlessly. I also run the same PUT scripts/programs on HPUX 10.x with apache with no 
problems.

I run the put method, and the Content-length of the size of the file being sent ge
ts set correctly, however opening up stdin to reading the file, and its empty, 
no file is being sent. no data is available to read...(so it hangs on the read to standa
rd input & eventually times out )
 Im absolutely positively certain its being sent through netscape composer or my own client programs.
The only thing thats changed is the OS upgrade. (also becauase the Content-length is correctly set)

The PUT script/program gets called but no data is available.

it launches my fileput.exe PUT handler program (i can see it being run with ps ax command)
(ive tesed it out in both c & perl), the content-length is correctly set to the size of the data being PUT'ed, however there
 is absolultely no data available to read at standard input... 

Ive tested it with my own programs & the ones from apacheweek.com sample:
Again the PUT handler program gets correctly launched, the content-length is correct, however
No data is available. This was working fine before the linux version upgrade &
 also runs on HPUX 10x with no problems

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

# Very simple PUT handler. Read the Apache Week article before attempting
# to use this script. You are responsible for ensure that this script is
# used securely.

# A simple log file, must be writable by the user that this program runs as.   
# Should not be within the document tree.
$putlog = "/tmp/put1.log";

# Check we are using PUT method 
if ($ENV{'REQUEST_METHOD'} ne "PUT") { &reply(500, "Request method is not PUT");
 }

# Note: should also check we are an authentication user by checking
# REMOTE_USER

# Check we got a destination filename
$filename = $ENV{'PATH_TRANSLATED'};
$filename="/tmp/puttest.dat";

&log("this is a test\n");

if (!$filename) { &reply(500, "No PATH_TRANSLATED"); }

# Check we got some content
$clength = $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'};
if (!$clength) { &reply(500, "Content-Length missing or zero ($clength)"); }   

# Read the content itself 
$toread = $clength;
$content = ""; 
&log("this is a test: $toread\n");    #### Size is Set Correctly ######
  

while ($toread > 0) 
{ 
    $nread = read(STDIN, $data, $clength);    ## HANGS NO DATA ###
    &reply(500, "Error reading content") if !defined($nread);
    $toread -= $nread;
    $content = $data;
}

# Write it out
# Note: doesn't check the location of the file, whether it already
# exists, whether it is a special file, directory or link. Does not
# set the access permissions. Does not handle subdirectories that
# need creating. 
open(OUT, "> $filename") || &reply(500, "Cannot write to $filename");
print OUT $content;
close(OUT);

# Everything seemed to work, reply with 204 (or 200). Should reply with 201
# if content was created, not updated.
&reply(204);

exit(0);
    
#   
# Send back reply to client for a given status.
#   
 
sub reply
{
    local($status, $message) = @_;
    local($remuser, $remhost, $logline) = ();

    print "Status: $status\n";
    print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";

    if ($status == 200) {
        print "<HEAD><TITLE>OK</TITLE></HEAD><H1>Content Accepted</H1>\n";
    } elsif ($status == 500) {
        print "<HEAD><TITLE>Error</TITLE></HEAD><H1>Error Publishing File</H1>\n
";
        print "An error occurred publishing this file ($message).\n";
    }
    # Note: status 204 and 201 gives have content part
    
    # Create a simple log
    $remuser = $ENV{'REMOTE_USER'} || "-";
    $remhost = $ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'} || $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} || "-";
 
    $logline = "$remhost $remuser $filename status $status";

    $logline .= " ($message)" if ($status == 500);
    &log($logline);
    exit(0);
}
    
sub log
{
    local($msg) = @_;
    open (LOG, ">> $putlog") || return;
    print LOG "$msg\n"; 
#    print LOG "$ENV{'REQUEST_METHOD'}\n";
#    print LOG %ENV;
    close(LOG);
}   








>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a PUT method program on redhat 5.2, linux 2.0.36-7 (out of the box redhat)

Execute a put method with netscape composer or other PUT method utility.

Put method handler program should be be able to get correct content-length
but hang on reading stdin (no data sent)


>Fix:
Check if any changes were made between the linux kernels (or gcc versions)
 & the way apache is writing data as input to the PUT programs. 
Maybe something has changed or is different.
