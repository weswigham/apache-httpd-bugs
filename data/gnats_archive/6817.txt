NT/2000
>Description:
In the main config file (httpd.conf), if you specify an absolute path in an include directive (such as: include "C:\Program Files\MyCGI\conf\myhttpd.conf"), apache will prefix this absolute path with its base directory, before trying to open the file. Thus, the resulting path is invalid. And apache wont start at all.
>How-To-Repeat:
In the httpd.conf file, add a line such as 'include "C:\XXX\myhttpd.conf"', and launch the test command line 'apache -t'.

State-Changed-Why:

Please try using back-slashes "\" rather than forward
slashes in the config files.  Changes will be made
in the next version of Apache to try to deal with
these issues.
Thanks for using Apache!

Woops, I said that backwards.  I meant use forward-slashes
"/" rather than back-slashes.
Sorry for the confusion.
