State-Changed-Why:

Please keep an eye out for the latest Apache 1.3.13 binary, 
to determine if it resolves your issues.  mod_isapi has
been overhauled, so you can expect that this is no longer
an issue.

Comment-Added:

Footnote, you can grab the latest tree at dev.apache.org
if you would like to help test the mod_isapi.  Also, at
this moment, it is available as a .zip file from the
dev.apache.org/~wrowe, although it will disappear from that
url once 1.3.13 is released.
