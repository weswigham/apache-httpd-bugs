>Description:
Files on NFS mounted drives cannot be accessed if the filenames include
uppercase characters.  A "file not found" error occurs.  "CheckSpelling on" does
not provide a workaround for this problem.  Files with lower case names and 
files on HPFS formatted drives can be accessed without problems.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a NFS mount to drive X:.
Alias /somepath/ X:/somepath/ in the Apache configuration file.
Try to access the file X:\somepath\MixedCaseName with
http://mysite/somepath/MixedCaseName or http://mysite/somepath/mixedcasename
(both ways fail). In contrast, try accessing X:\somepath\lowercasename with
http://mysite/somepath/lowercasename (it works).
>Fix:
Allow override of URL case conversion in the configuration file.  Preferably,
allow override on directories specified in the configuration file.
Alternatively, just eliminate the conversion to lower case.
