>Description:
I've had this problem with both Apache and NCSA HTTPD1.3 web servers. The access
_log logs an entry similar to this:
machine.domain.whatever - - [07/Dec/1998:13:12:40 -0500] "GET /undefined HTTP/1.0" 404 -

These entries are beginning to flood the access_log, going into the hundreds of thousands. 
What is causing this "/undefined" or "/null" entry? And what makes it strange is that 
the log entries happen within seconds of eachother during times when no one is on the machine. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Don't know -- on an intranet. 
>Fix:
I know it can't be someone going to documents that are simply not there, it wouldn't 
produce such an entry.And I know that the time pattern, although close, is not 100% consistent.

State-Changed-Why:
I see no reason to think this has anything to do with the web
server, seeing as you are saying it is happening with multiple
different web servers.

It is almost certainly simply some broken client for some resaon
requesting that file.  That is exactly what you would
get in the logs if a client was requesting a file that doesn't
exist, so I don't know why you say that can't be the case.
