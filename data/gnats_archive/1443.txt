SunOS www.frognet.com 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4c
>Description:
This was difficult to catch in action, but several child httpd processes will 
start showing up as "DW" in the process table. There is NO way to get rid of them,
i.e. kill -9 (as root) will not work. They begin to grow in number and gradually,
the load on the box will reach Max Clients if I don't reboot first. Kill -9 httpd.pid
doesn't get rid of these, just kills the parent.
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem is repeating itself almost daily on our machine. 
Don't know how to replicate on another machine.

 Can you use strace/truss/ktrace (whatever it is under sunos) to find out
 what the bad children are doing?

 Hi Dean,
 
 Thanks for replying. I can try, but its difficult to catch this happening
 in action. Especially because now the priority is keeping the server usable
 - so I wrote a script to check the load and automatically reboot the server
 if it goes over 20, 2 times in a row.
 
 But if I manage to, I will send you the trace output.

State-Changed-Why:
In addition to what Dean said, are you serving files via
NFS or is your ServerRoot located on a NFS mounted
partition?

Processes becoming unkillable is almost always something
broken with the OS; almost nothing a process can do should be able
to make it completely unkillable.
