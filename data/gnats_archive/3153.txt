We are unable to help you with the amount of information given.
This does not appear to be anything related to Apache, butu more
of a basic HTML question.  Please use the other methods given
for such questions, such as Usenet.

You need to know exactly what URL you are accessing, what
the contents of the index file are, where the images are,
if they can be loaded into your browser if accessed
directly, and what appears in the error log.

 Have you verified that the HTML links are correct.
 Try using absolute links in your HTML files or give the complete
 URL of a 'picture' ie
 http://www.apache.org/images/apache_logo.gif
 Does that same page work when not in a ~user directory...
 say in your DocumentRoot?
 Please try these things and provide feedback.
 Thanks for using Apache.
