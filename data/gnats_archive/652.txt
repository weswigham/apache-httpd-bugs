>Environment:

     SunOS 4.1.4 sun4m fully patched to present time from SunSolve.
 
     gcc 2.7.2.f.1
>Description:

     This is a long standing problem from WAY BACK, that we have
fixed only by commenting out certain parts of the code in http_main.c
 
     As a vanilla apache runs, we get significant load spikes
that send the load to 10 or more every few minutes.  This causes
momentary freezing of the system and general stickiness.  
 
      The load spikes do NOT seem to be CPU based, but I/O based,
as no particular process shows a high cpu utilization using top
at that moment.  ps never shows anything.  The spikes are VERY fast,
and subside as fast as they come.  They are quite visible using
xload under X11.
 
     By commenting out a certain section of http_main.c, the
load spikes go away and everything runs smoothly.
 
     The problem is not repeatable, we have never been able to cause
it happen at will by hitting on any single web page.  However 
they happen randomly and continuously every few minutes.

     Yes, the patch that fixes it is at

 Hypothesis: select() under sunos 4.x wakes up all waiting children when an
 event happens.  All the children then race down to the accept() and block
 in there.  That'll spike momentarily.  Most OSs have this behaviour
 actually. 
 
 See <http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi/full/467> and give the suggestions
 there a try.  That should achieve the same thing as your patch without
 requiring you to hack up the code (and also supporting multiple Listen
 statements, which yours doesn't). 
 
 It's looking more and more plausible for us to use serialized accepts on
 all architectures.

Haven't heard back... assuming that the serialisation fix did
the trick.

Comment-Added:
Since SunOS4 does not have a FIN_WAIT_2 timeout, a busy
server will quickly fill its mbuf table and crash if
persistent connections are enabled.

Homer reports that setting

    KeepAlive Off

in httpd.conf seems to fix the problems.
