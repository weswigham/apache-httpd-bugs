>Description:
I've been using apache for quite a while as our local webserver.
I just recently upgraded to IE 4.0 and things seem to work as expected
except when I visit pages on our server, the entire page will load
flawlessly, but the page load indicator at the bottom of the window
keeps chugging away for about 5 seconds or so after the entire page is loaded.
At first I thought it was a problem with IE 4.0 but IE 4.0 doesnt do this with
pages that are offsite at all, so that points to something on my server config
but nothing like this happens with IE 3.02 or Netscape...

Theres no chance for lag here because this is directly on the network...

using IE 4.0, go to www.insolwwb.net

State-Changed-Why:
This is very unlikely to be an Apache bug.  The latest
beta (since that is what the current release is) of IE4
attempts to make HTTP/1.1 requests but fails so badly that
it is amazing they ever let it out of their labs.  It is
bad even for Microsoft.

You could try adding something like:

    BrowserMatch "MSIE 4\.0b2;" nokeepalive force-response-1.0 downgrade-1.0

to your config file to attempt to work around MSIE's broken
behavior.  If you still see the same thing when Microsoft
releases the final version, then it is possible there is
something else, but at this point it is almost certainly
a bug in IE.
