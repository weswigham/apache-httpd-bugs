>Description:
Apache seems to have just locked up while doing a normal restart. There are no errors in the error log and the last entry just says [Sun Jul 30 18:18:38 2000] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart it will not come up. We have tried shutting it back down it takes the command and shutsdown but will not restart. The error log never changes we are stumped with a locked up server!
