 It would be useful if you said something about what you are doing.
 
 _what_ are you putting in the htaccess?
 
 What sort of SSI are you using?  Is it calling a CGI script?  Is the CGI
 in the same directory?  Does calling the CGI directly still work?
 
 Please show the _exact_ lines from your error log.
