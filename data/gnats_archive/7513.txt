Here's what I sent to Apple.  Perhaps you can be more responsive.

--Reproducible:  Sometimes
--Severity:      (2) No workaround
--Effect:        Will effect user


-- Steps to Reproduce:

On a MacOS X system installed on an HFS+ disk, put the following in /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/test.cgi:

#!/bin/sh
echo Content-type: text/plain
echo
echo PATH_INFO = "$PATH_INFO"
echo PATH_TRANSLATED = "$PATH_TRANSLATED"
echo QUERY_STRING = "$QUERY_STRING"
cat "$PATH_TRANSLATED"

Set the Execute bits on the file (Using 'chmod a+x /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/test.cgi' from Terminal.)

Create any text file as /Library/WebServer/Documents/data.txt

Verify Apache is enabled.  (Web Sharing is enabled.)

Attempt to access these files by going to any browser and entering the URL:
<http://<ip address>/cgi-bin/test.cgi/data.txt>

-- Expected Results:

The CGI should display some header information, then copy the text file to the browser.


-- Actual Results:

About half the time, the browser displays the 403 Forbidden message.  If it doesn't, you can create a different text file and try again.  Eventually, it will fail.  It seems to be related to time of day.  Sometimes it fails every time I use a different text file; sometimes it succeeds for hours.  If it is failing, it will fail consistantly with the same file.  If it is failing, and you enter the URL <http://<ip address>/cgi-bin/test.cgi>, that will clear up the problem, and the next attempt to enter <http://<ip address>/cgi-bin/test.cgi/data.txt> will succeed.

If it is failing, the Apache error log reports:
[<date/time>] [error] [client <ip address>] (21)Is a directory: access to /cgi-bin/test.cgi/data.txt failed

The problem is related to the way Apache parses the URL for a CGI, and the unexpected results it gets from the operating system.  I installed the latest version of Apache (1.3.19) and, when it showed the same behavior, started investigating.  In http_request.c, about line 175, is a routine called get_path_info.  About line 249 it calls the system routine stat, with a path of /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/test.cgi/data.txt (which obviously doesn't exist.)  The routine expects to get either a ENOENT or ENOTDIR error.  MacOS sometimes returns a EISDIR error, which causes get_path_info to return HTTP_FORBIDDEN.

When Apache is failing the ls command also fails.  That is,
ls -l /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/test.cgi/data.txt
responds with "Is a directory", which is absurd.

-- Workaround:

None that I know of, short of changing Apache.  

-- Isolation:

This problem did not occur on the MacOS X Server where the system was on a UFS disk.  I'm not sure which change is relevent, and I don't have sufficient hardware to isolate it further.

>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
Either check for EISDIR in get_path_info, or put in some system-dependent code to identify MacOS as brain-dead.
