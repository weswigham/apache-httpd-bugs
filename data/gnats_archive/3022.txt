Does not matter - verified with many unix version, and also many old apache version.
>Description:
printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: dungeon.inka.de\r\n\r\n\0GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: dungeon.inka.de\r\n\r\n" |socket localhost 80 |less
not the \0 before the second request - the is invalid.
apache gives back an 501 Not implemented (that's ok), but it doesn't give a 
HTTP/1.1 501 Header, but starts directly with <!DOCTYPE ...

>How-To-Repeat:
the shell command above gives it (printf is a bash function, socket a common
found tool to pipe stdin/out via tcp/ip to some daemon.
>Fix:
send a HTTP/1.1 501 ... 
header with all the usual stuff (Date: Server: etc.)

State-Changed-Why:
You are sending an invalid request.  Because this is an invalid
request and because of the way Apache deals with headers,
Apache probably won't see the HTTP/x.x at the end of
the line, meaning it defaults to a 0.9 response which includes
no headers.

I really don't see the problem with this.
