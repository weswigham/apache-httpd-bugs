HPUX 9.05 with HP cc
>Description:
I switched from NCSA 1.5 to Apache 1.2b2 (I'll grab 1.2b4 shortly) and had a 
problem with some imagemap files.  It took me about 20 minutes to figure out
that one cannot have whitespace surrounding the commas in the coordinate lists.
I.e. one must have 345,765 or 982,92 but not 345, 765 or 982 , 92.  I think 
a little blurb in the mod_imap documentation in the 'Coordinates' section
will save other users similar headaches.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
change documentation or allow whitespace around commas in imagemap file

I will propose a patch to fix the problem by modifying

of the releases coming up sometime.
