>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Slackware Linux version 7.1
>Description:
1. path to perl in this environment is /usr/bin/perl
2. When NOT using APACI installation five variables are not substituted,
my $CFG_PREFIX        = q(@prefix@);            # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_SBINDIR       = q(@sbindir@);           # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_INCLUDEDIR    = q(@includedir@);        # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = q(@libexecdir@);        # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_SYSCONFDIR    = q(@sysconfdir@);        # substituted via APACI install
>How-To-Repeat:
Use old ./Configure option in src/ (not APACI)
do "make apxs" in src/support.
>Fix:
Unsure how to fix, but include comments within apxs as to what the variables should be.
