State-Changed-Why:
You have probably already figured out the problem that
you were having, but if not then check if you installed
Apache as a service and if you did make sure when you
'uninstalled' it that the 'Service' was also deleted.

Also if this is still a problem please give some specific
examples of failure....ie I do A then B and I get C....
Thanks for using Apache.
