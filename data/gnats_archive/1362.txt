HP-UX B 10.20 A  Patches - Consolidated Patches July 1997
Ansi C Compiler
>Description:
A CGI script written in UNIX shell script format calls the "expr" command to
perform simple arithmetic calculation (addition).  The resulting variable has
no value.  This shell script was working fine with the CERN Server used previous
ly.  This same behavior was noted in other similar scripts as well.

Please give a full example of the most basic shell script
that doesn't work as you think it should.  It is _very_
unlikely that this has anything to do with Apache.

 I sent a response to this request for further information, a few days ago. 
  I am resending to make sure that you go it.   Here is the example you 
 requested.
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________

 #! /bin/sh
 echo "Content-type: text/html"               # begin WEB Page initialization
 echo ""
 echo "<HTML><HEAD>"                          # begin header
 echo "<META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT=300>"  # refresh the Page every 300 
 seconds, (5 minutes)
 echo "<TITLE>Port Statuses</TITLE>"  # set the "TITLE" label
 echo "</HEAD><BODY>"                         # end of header, begin page 
 body
 echo "<b><FONT SIZE=4>DEVICE <FONT COLOR="red" SIZE=3>Port Statuses 
 </FONT></b><br>"  # add page heading
 ctr=0
 echo "Counter at $ctr<br>"
 ctr=`expr $ctr + 1`                          # add 1 to variable counter
 echo "Counter at $ctr<br>"
 echo "</BODY></HTML>"

 I have also noticed that the "sort" command seems to produce the same 
 results.  That is, a variable contains nothing after being run through a 
 standard sort.  When a command is piped through a sort, the variable is 
 empty.  If the sort is removed and the rest of the command is left the same, 
 the output is normal.  This behavior is not noted when the script is run 
 under a normal shell in UNIX.
 
 Thanks for your help.
