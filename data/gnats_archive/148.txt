State-Changed-When: Mon Feb 17 14:13:12 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
I have tried to find someone with a machine running 
NeXT OpenStep 4.x who can find and fix the problem, but
have not had any luck.  Would I be able to get a temporary
login on a machine running OpenStep 4.x to try to find and
fix the problem?

State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 21 11:15:29 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Appears to be a problem due to interaction between gcc
and the system header files.  Anything which includes
<netinet/tcp.h> will have the problem; from testing on
the reporter's machine, it seems like some macros dealing
with byte order are both being evaluated as true.
