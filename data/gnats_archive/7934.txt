>Release:        1.3.14
>Organization:
>Environment:
Apache 1.3.14 with tomcat 3.2 , OpenSSL 0.9.6 and modSSL 2.7.2 on a Win 2000 m/c having 1GB memory and dual pentium processor
We have a Verisign global id (128bit)
>Description:
I have a JSP-Servlet application and I am using mod_jk to connect from apache to tomcat. The SSL is configured with modSSL . The customers trying to connect to the SSL page ( servlet) via dialup get the above error on IE. This error is repeated on many diaup connections. The error does not appear on Win NT m/c with the exact same configuration. All pages display fine on a Netscape browser.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install the above tools on the Win 2000 m/c and try to access a servlet over a diaup in Secure environment.
>Fix:
I don't know if this is an Apache issue or a Microsoft issue. I need to know if anyone in this list has encountered similar problems.

State-Changed-Why:

The mod_ssl, ApacheSSL and other SSL solutions are not part
of the Apache distribution, they have been authored by
third party groups such as modssl.org

Please work with your ssl provider to solve this issue, as
we cannot support third party modules.
