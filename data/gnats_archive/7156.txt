>Description:
The internal hostname of our development/test server is rs_corp_2.  I installed apache on that system but if I specify the URL http://rs_corp_2 I get a 400 bad request page and the error_log states "client sent a malformed host header".

I've found several references to this issue but no solutions that have worked for me. I've configured a CNAME record without an underscore and that works fine.

What is the recommended solution?

Regards,

Dan
>How-To-Repeat:
See above. 
>Fix:
I'm under the impression that underscores should not be used in hostnames. I think there should be setting in the httpd.conf file that turns on or off strick hostname checking.

State-Changed-Why:

As has been noted numerous times in the bug database,
underscores are NOT permitted in hostnames.  This is
according to the RFCs for DNS, which are referenced
by the HTTP RFCs, with which Apache is compliant.

But note that 1.3.17 is more liberal in handling hostnames.
