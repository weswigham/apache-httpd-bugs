 Run 'aclocal; automake; autoconf' to generate the configure script
 (provided your have the tools described in the README.install). Future
 snapshot distributions will contain the configure script, as soon as the
 snapshot generation script has been updated.

Comment-Added:
the docs are wrong; currently you need automake, autoconf,
m4, and libtool (with specific version requirements).  the
snapshots need to be fixed so that they're generated
differently (so that you don't need these things).

the snapshots may not be fixed for another two weeks; 
hopefully the docs will be fixed before then.
