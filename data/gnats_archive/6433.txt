>Description:
Problem: API module structure `jserv_module' in file /etc/httpd/modules/mod_jserv.so is garbled - perhaps this is not an Apache module DSO?
This seems to some configuration related problem with httpd and JServ.
I neither found an example httpd.conf, nor documentation on how to configure 
httpd.conf. I had a working Apache httpd and JServ (older version that used mod_jserv.c).
Is the problem RPM related or configuration related? Any documentation please. 
None of the install instructions describe this.
