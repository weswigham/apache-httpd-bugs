>Description:
I get the error: [Sat Dec 29 10:54:18 2001] [crit] make_sock: failed to get a socket for port 80 whenever i start apache.
I have just bought a new computer, and i have only installed win98se, and some other programs that are irrevelant.
I am sure that i have nothing running on port 80, and when i run netstat -an, i get a error.
I have checked that winsock2 is running, and it is.

Please help me on this.

Cheers,
Tom Loten
