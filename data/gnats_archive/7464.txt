>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 6a  running on a Netfinity 5100.
>Description:
Apache.exe is running at 99% CPU.  I have to stop and start the ibm http server to reset CPU.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure
>Fix:
I believe the fix for this problem is the driver for the SCSI disk. I did not have a driver for the disk when i examined it under scsi adapters. The only driver listed was for the CD-Rom drive. I downloaded the latest driver and applied it. I have not had a problem with the CPU since then. The Netfinity box that we have was configured by IBM.
