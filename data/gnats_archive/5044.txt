>Environment:
Solaris 7.0/Sparc
>Description:
Our Apache runs on 2 different ports (80,8080). There is a global statement
in the context for all virtual servers:

<location /status>
SetHandler server-status
AuthType Basic
require group www-admin
AuthName "Apache Server Status"
</location>

I can access http://servername:8080/status correctly
but not http://servername:80/status - I get a 401 response.
This worked correctly in 1.3.6 :-|

More infos needed ?
