>Description:
Every time I try to start Apache, I the server fails to start and the entry
in the error log is as follows:

[Mon Sep 25 09:45:19 2000] [warn] make_sock: problem listening on port 81, filedescriptor (302) larger than FD_SETSIZE (128) found, you probably need to rebuild Apache with a larger FD_SETSIZE

[Mon Sep 25 09:45:19 2000] [crit] No sockets were created for listening

This was reported in Problem Report 5842 but it did not work on my server.
