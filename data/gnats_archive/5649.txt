>Description:
Hi,

I want to compile Apache1.3.9 for Linux with JServ1.1, but failed.
If I compile the Apache1.3.9 alone, it was successfull.

The followin is my install procedures (Apache1.3.9 & JServ) :

1) in Apache source dir,
    # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache_1.3.9

2) in JServ source dir,
    # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/jserv -with-apache-src=/usr/local/src/apache_1.3.9
    # make
   # make install

(NO ERRORS in the previous 2 procedures)

3) return to Apache source dir,
    # make
    # make install



But in procedure 3), I saw some errors when type MAKE
....
...
<=== src/modules/standard
===> src/modules/jserv
make[4]: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
make[3]: *** [all] Error 1
make[2]: *** [subdirs] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/apache/apache_1.3.9/src'
make[1]: *** [build-std] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/apache/apache_1.3.9'
make: *** [build] Error 2


Would you please to teach me how can I solve this ?
I could compile the Apache 1.3.9 alone successfully without the procedure 1) in the above.



Best regards,
Eric
