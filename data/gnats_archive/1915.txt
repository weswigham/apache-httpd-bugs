>Description:
We need a www-server supporting Java-Servlets. In Suns JSDK is a package 
allowing servlets to be run in Apache 1.1.3. Do you support servlets in 
the latest version of Apache or do you plan to support them soon?
Or, if not, do you know a third-party package to upgrade the latest Apache
for Servlets?

The problem is very urgent to us, so please send me an answer today.

State-Changed-Why:
This is for bugs, not for user questions.  This is made
crystal clear before you submit a PR.

See http://java.apache.org/  I really don't know why you
couldn't take two seconds, go to a search engine or dejanews, and see
what magic results you find.
