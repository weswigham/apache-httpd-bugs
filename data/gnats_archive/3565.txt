>Description:
It appears that when apache spawns a child process, once that process is finished it doesn't exit correctly.  We have had this problem on two servers both running apache.  We have raised the max processes per user multiple times on the machines and the error simply takes longer to reoccur, but it does reoccur at some point.  The only way to release the processes started is to SIGHUP httpd.  I have noticed in the bug report database, that there are many people saying that it is the load the sets it off, but I believe that apache isn't releasing the processes correctly as suggested by someone in bug report #83.
