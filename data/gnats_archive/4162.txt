>Environment:
win32 (win98 specifically)
>Description:
Suggestion/request that in future versions, the win32 (specifically win9x) the application minimize to the tray area (area with the little clock and stuff) and not the task bar.  Saves room.  Possibly look into making it auto-start as a win9x system service (as aparently has been done with NT).

As stated, no problems.
>Fix:
Not proficient enough in programming as of yet.
