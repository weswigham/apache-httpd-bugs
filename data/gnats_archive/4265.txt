Any
>Description:
Right now, Apache shuts down the server during an apachectl restart if the httpd.conf file 
refers to a syntactically valid, but unknown directive.  This happens both due
to spelling errors or leaving out a LoadModule directive.  This is not acceptable in
a production environment with multiple virtual hosts.  Rather, the server should
issue a warning and keep processing.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Possibilities:
1. The server could issue a warning and ignore the improper directive.
2. The server could check any configuration before restarting.

 Please close this bug report. Apache already implements one of the suggested solutions.  My
 apologies.
