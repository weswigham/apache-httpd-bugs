>Description:
Between 1.3.22 and 1.3.23, a change was made to one line in mod_rewrite.c:

<     return ((double)(rand() % RAND_MAX) / RAND_MAX) * (h - l + 1) + l;
---
>     return (int)((double)(rand() % RAND_MAX) / RAND_MAX) * (h - l + 1) + l;

This breaks the random balancing between the value parts in a rnd type map, at least on RedHat 7.2: it always selects the first value part.

This map type is normally used for load balancing through Apache. If such a setup is tried with Apache 1.3.23, all load will be sent to the first system.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to use a rnd type map.
>Fix:
If the above change is reverted, i.e. remove the (int) that was added, the rnd map type will function as expected again.

State-Changed-Why:

Bingo.  You hit the nail on the head, I've wrapped the
entire expression before casting to (int) for the correct
return type.

This problem should be resolved in 1.3.24 - thank you for
the report and identifying the solution!!!
