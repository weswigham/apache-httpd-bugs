>Description:
When running apache 1.3.23 as a proxy, it does not properly pass multiple
"Set-Cookie:" headers to the client.  I tried to log into mail.yahoo.com and
it responded with three cookies.  Apache discarded the first two and only
passed the third "Set-Cookie:" header line to the client.  (This was verified
by packet snooping.)

As a check, I built and configured apache_1.3.22 exactly the same way.  It
appears to work properly.

I built apache with:
  ./configure --prefix=/home/sford/apache --enable-module=rewrite --enable-module=proxy --disable-rule=SHARED_CORE

I configured the proxy with:
    ProxyRequests On
    <Directory proxy:*>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 10.10.10.104
    </Directory>
    ProxyVia On
    CacheRoot "/home/sford/apache/proxy"
    CacheSize 1
    CacheGcInterval 4
    CacheMaxExpire 24
    CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
    CacheDefaultExpire 1
>How-To-Repeat:
Build 1.3.23 as above and configure a client to proxy through it.  Then try to
log into mail.yahoo.com.  (Make sure the client doesn't already have cookies
set.)  It helps to do a packet dump of both sides of apache.
