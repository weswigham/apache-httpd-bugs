Windows 98
>Description:
Windows have no crypt() function. Older (< 1.3.5) Apache servers _IGNORED_
password encryption, so, if a password file line was:
"admin:haqoJZBx9Q1w2"
, Windows version used "haqoJZBx9Q1w2" as READY, NOT ENCRYPTED password. So,
all my password file lines looked like:
"admin:d4mnimg00d"
. Now, someone ripped out this nice Windows mistake, and my error log is full
of these lines:
"[Mon Apr 19 15:18:53 1999] [error] [client 200.210.11.39] user admin: authentication failure for "/server-status": crypt() unavailable on Win32, cannot validate password"
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to run Apache on Windows system :)
>Fix:
Yes. I'm a very bad C programmer, but I think you'll understeand me.
Well, the file to be patched is "[apache_dir]/src/ap/ap_md5c.c".
Line 603. What we have here?
/* START CODE */
#ifdef WIN32
	return "crypt() unavailable on Win32, cannot validate password";
#else
	crypt_pw = crypt(passwd, hash);
	ap_cpystrn(sample, crypt_pw, sizeof(sample) - 1);
#endif
    }
    return (strcmp(sample, hash) == 0) ? NULL : "password mismatch";
}
/* END CODE */

All right... Now, patched version:
/* START CODE */
#ifdef WIN32
	ap_cpystrn(sample, password, sizeof(sample) - 1);
#else
	crypt_pw = crypt(passwd, hash);
	ap_cpystrn(sample, crypt_pw, sizeof(sample) - 1);
#endif
    }
    return (strcmp(sample, hash) == 0) ? NULL : "password mismatch";
}
/* END CODE */

I think, this wouldn't work, but, I hope, you understood my idea!

 All right! If MY patch code will work, inform me, please! I have no
 Visual C++ on this machine... And _please_, if it work, put my name on
 src/CHANGES :) Thanks for attention!

Actually, this was detected and fixed within a couple of
days of the 1.3.6 release.  It has been reported in the
bugdb before.  The fix will appear in the next release.
Thanks for using Apache!
