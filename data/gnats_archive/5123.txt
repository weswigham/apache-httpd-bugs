Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs

>Description:

This used to work on my RedHat 6.0 installation. I now upgraded to a new box with RedHat 6.1, funnily enough with the same compiler, but the configure script doesn't work... The rest, like MySql, and PHP3 compiles great... The first time after untarring the apache directory I *can* configure, and it does finish... every subsequent time, it doesn't.. *sniff... What am I to do ?

There is error whatsoever indicating what could be wrong, and I am definately using gcc....

 ./configure --with-layout=RedHat --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a

Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.9
 + using installation path layout: RedHat (config.layout)
 + activated php3 module (modules/php3/libphp3.a)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Linux platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
    o php3_module uses ConfigStart/End
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!

>How-To-Repeat:
Install RedHat 6.1, install and build mysql and imap4.6 from source , install php3 from source and make the module
>Fix:
I have no clue... I don't even know where to find the output of what ./configure actually tries to compile, that's the frustrating part... EVERYTHING else compiles without *any* problems....
