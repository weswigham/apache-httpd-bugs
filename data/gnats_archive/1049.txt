>Description:
Say, I've following setup:
in DNS files:
xxx IN A 1.2.3.4
yyy IN CNAME xxx

in httpd.conf:
Port 80
Listen 80
Listen 8000
Listen 8001
DocumentRoot /www/ht-xxx
<VirtualHost yyy:*>
DocumentRoot /www/ht-yyy
</VirtualHost>

In this case, when I'm accessing URL http://xxx:80 or http://yyy:80
with Netscape Navigator, I'll get right document. 
But when I'm accessing URL http://yyy:8000,
I'll get document with URL http://xxx:8000.


Source of problem:

Netscape set Host: header in HTTP-request to hostname:port
(of course, if port specified in URL string). 

In file http_protocol.c, in function check_hostalias, line 715-716
we can see:
  if (port && (port != r->server->port))
    return;
where port - portnumber, given from Host: header.
In this case, check_hostalias not performs any hostalias/virtualhost
checks and main server context (or default Virtual host) is assumed. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, I have no test-server on-line. You can repeat this bug
by using example config given above.
>Fix:
Comment out piece of code, described above (lines 715-716 in
http_protocol.c%2

State-Changed-Why:
Yes you appear to be correct.  I'm pretty sure I know what
this was attempting to workaround in pre 1.2 code, but I think
the issues have been resolved otherways in 1.2.  It's definately
incorrect to do this check in 1.3 (where vhosts were again
hacked on).  I'm submitting a patch for consideration in
1.2.5 and 1.3b1.

Thanks

This won't be fixed in the 1.2 series, but it is fixed in
the 1.3 series.
