>Environment:
SunOS 5.6 Generic_105181-03 sparc
>Description:
When the call to connect() inside start_connect() doesn't block, a call to write_request()
is performed without checking that the number of 'done' requests is less than the requested
amount.
>How-To-Repeat:
Execute 'ab -n 1 -c 1' in a situation where the connect() call won't block (e.g. on the same
physical host as the web server) -- two requests will be made to the web server, although ab will
only report on one of them (because it abandons the socket after calling write_request() the
second time).
>Fix:
Either remove the call to write_request() in start_connect(), or check the
number of done requests before calling write_request(). Here's a diff for the first
option:

      }
  
      /* connected first time */
!     write_request(c);
  }

--- 536,543 ----
      }
  
      /* connected first time */
!     c->state = STATE_CONNECTING;
!     FD_SET(c->fd, &writebits);
  }
  
  /* --------------------------------------------------------- */
