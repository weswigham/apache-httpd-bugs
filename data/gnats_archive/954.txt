>Description:
The -Indexes option is not working for user directories. It successfully
restricts files in the DOCROOT of the server, but it displays the 
directory contents of /~user/* directories if they do not have an
index.html file.

Since the CHANGES documentation for 1.2.1 does not mention this, I do not
think that upgrading from 1.2.0 will make a difference.

State-Changed-Why:
I doubt the Indexes option is broken in the way you describe.
This is probably a configuration problem.  Please post the
relevant section of your config file that is setting
this.  Are you sure you aren't setting it in a Directory
section applicable only to your document root and not user
directories?

 Mark,
 
 I'm including my access.conf file. I'm certain this option worked for me in
 the past with 1.2b* and the same access.conf. I looked at the distribution
 access.conf for 1.2.1 and it looks similar as well. It is my understanding
 that configuration settings for the DocumentRoot apply to all
 subdirectories (including user directories) unless they are specifically
 overridden.
 
 /www/www/research is our DocumentRoot as defined in srm.conf. For
 historical reasons user accounts are under /usr.
 
 Regards,
 Christian

 Erm... /usr is not a subdirectory of /www/www/research.  A Directory
 setting for /www/www/research will not and should not impact /usr at all. 
 The path on the web is not related to the path on the file system.  The
 Location directive uses the web path, the Directory one uses the file
 system path.

 If you want the above to apply everywhere, use something like Directory /.
