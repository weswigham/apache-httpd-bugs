If you want a core backtrace, you can join me.

Build a pline
apply in Curve Menu : "Compute curvature" or "compute torsion"
>Fix:
The probleme is located in "pl_computer.cc" and "datapack.cc".
 There is a segmentation violation at the level of the function :
 curve_->datapack().find_property_record_index().
 Apparently the fields_ of the datapack is empty (?!).

This is for reporting bugs in the Apache web server software,
