>Description:
If a file specified with a RewriteMap directive doesn't exist, but the
RewriteEngine directive is set to "off", when you start the httpd it
returns the following error and exits:

   Syntax error on line 214 of /local/www/conf/httpd.conf:
   RewriteMap: map file or program not found:/local/www/lib/user-rewrite

Line 214 of my httpd.conf is:

  RewriteMap webusers txt:/local/www/lib/user-rewrite

Presumably, the same behavior occurs with a DBM rewrite file, though I haven't
tested this.

Ideally, if the RewriteEngine directive is "off", this wouldn't be considered
a fatal error (if an error at all).
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure a server with mod_rewrite and the following directives:

  RewriteEngine off
  RewriteMap testmap txt:/i-dont-exist

and start the server.
>Fix:
Commenting out the RewriteMap directive will of course avoid the problem,
but the documentation points out that the purpose of the RewriteEngine
directive is so you don't have to comment out all your mod_rewrite directives.
