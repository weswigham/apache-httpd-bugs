Windows 95.  Apache ver. 1.3.4, Haven't gotten far enough to need a compiler.
>Description:
Ok so this may not be bug persay.  But if a semi-competant computer user can't
figure out how to how to use your program then how can you call this a freely
available server.  Anyway, downloaded version 1.3.4 for win32 and ran the install
program.  So what do I do from here?  I tried running the apache.exe program but
all I get is a nonresponsive DOS window.  Can you help me?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Ok maybe i'm not a computer programmer but I think you could up the 
userfriendlyness a notch.
