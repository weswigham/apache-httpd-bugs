Redhat 6.0

>Description:
In jserv.conf, if you have multiple mount points such as:

	ApJServMount /servlets /root
	ApJServMount /servlets /coolservlet

you should get an error indicating why the
configuration is wrong.  Right now, the above
configuration can sometimes work ok (with /root
actually working!), but other times (say if the
order of the mount directives is reversed) can
work fine!

Graceful error reporting is much appreciated!
