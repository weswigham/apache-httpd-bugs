BSDI 4.0 must include the kvm library to compile
>Description:
I had a problem setting limits on users PARENT processes per suexec.. so
I took the code and modified suexec.c and suexec.h to fix this problem.
Now I have the ability to set resource limits based on users classes in the
the bsdi environment. The code is well commented an all defaults are in
suexec.h. Just thought you guys might be interesed in it. If you want the 
code just send me and email address to send it to :) I love apache, keep
up the good work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try and set resource limits and you'll notice it only works for children
processes not parent.
>Fix:
Use my modified version of suexec.
