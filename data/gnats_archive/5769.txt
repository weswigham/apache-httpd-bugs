Subject: mod_headers won't append to Cache-Control header created by mod_expires

>Organization:
>Environment:
RH Linux 5.2, kernel 2.0.36, i686
>Description:
At the server level, we set this directive for mod_headers:

Header append Cache-Control "public, must-revalidate"

then at the Directory level, we set these directives for mod_expires:

ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault "modification plus 4 hours"

Our goal is to get a Cache-Control header like this:

Cache-Control: max-age=13871, public, must-revalidate

However, the only Cache-Control header we get from the server is this:

Cache-Control: max-age=13871

I have tried two variations on this.  I have changed "append" to
"set".  Still no "public, must-revalidate" in the Cache-Control
header.  I then tried removing the mod_expires directives.  Then
I got:

Cache-Control: public, must-revalidate


>How-To-Repeat:
I found another user mentioning this problem on DejaNews.  He was
using the NT version, so I guess that it's fairly widespread.

Here are the modules I've got compiled in (the only non-standard
ones are usertrack, rewrite, headers, and expires):

Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_rewrite.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_expires.c
  mod_headers.c
  mod_usertrack.c
  mod_setenvif.c

This problem was actually in mod_expires, and has been
fixed.  The fix should appear in the next version after
1.3.12.  Thanks for the report.
