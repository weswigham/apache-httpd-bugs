>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1
Browser: MSIE 4.71, Netscape is okay
>Description:
The server intermittently logs "Invalid method on request" during POST operations
from a MSIE 4.71 browser. A "snoop" shows the data from the browser as appearing okay.

Apparently, r->method falls out to M_INVALID in read_request in http_protocol.c,
because strcmp to all methods fail. Consequently, the routine default_handler in
http_core.c fails.

I modified the line in default_handler to dump the r->method:
log_printf(r->server, "Invalid method (%s)in request %s",r->method, r->the_request);

It produced the following in the error_log file:
[Wed Feb 11 10:37:16 1998] Invalid method (exempt=adm&n_1=on&button=Hold+OrderGET)in reque
st exempt=adm&n_1=on&button=Hold+OrderGET /icons/bg/bg.gif HTTP/1.1

Here is the output of the access_log file:
146.13.148.37 - - [11/Feb/1998:10:37:15 -0500] "POST /cgi-bin/procorder.sh/rfr HTTP/1.1" 4
01 362
146.13.148.37 - amv1300 [11/Feb/1998:10:37:16 -0500] "POST /cgi-bin/procorder.sh/rfr HTTP/
1.1" 200 2216
146.13.148.37 - - [11/Feb/1998:10:37:16 -0500] "exempt=adm&n_1=on&button=Hold+OrderGET /ic
ons/bg/bg.gif HTTP/1.1" 501 213

From what I see, it appears that a image request is being merged with the previous
request, but I'm not sure. It also seems that MSIE is not presenting its authorization
(the user has already been authorized for this directory under previous page hits)
and the server is not handling the request properly.

Does anybody have a clue as to what's going on?

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, this is a known bug in Apache.  See PR#1399.
A fix has been found and will be available in 1.2.6 and
1.3b4 when released.  I think there is a patch in the
PR1399 log too.

Thanks for the report.

 The patch in 1399 isn't complete.  It's probably easiest if you just give
 1.2.6-dev a try... I'll place a copy of it at:
 
 http://www.arctic.org/~dgaudet/apache/1.2.6-dev.tar.gz
 
 Thanks

 Thanks very much, Dean. It works! My only concern if it's solid enough for my production. How comfortable
 are you with this cut? I see there were quite a few mods compare to 1.2.5.
 
 I see that the problem is associated with HTTP/1.1. As an alternative, could I somehow force 1.0 and stay with
 the 1.2.5? Or, is this not worth considering?

 Pretty much everything in 1.2.6-dev currently has been tested in one of
 the 1.3 betas for a while.  I've been running the 1.2.6-dev code for a few
 weeks on one of my servers without incident.  It should be stable -- the
 goal with the 1.2.x series is stability.  1.2.5 had a small change list
 because it was intended to fix security bugs and we wanted to get it out
 quickly. 
 
 But take a peek at www.apache.org/docs/misc/known_client_problems.html, it
 mentions how to force apache to pretend to be responding with http/1.0.

 Thanks, Dean. I think I'll stick with the 1.2.6 version. Our testers have been banging on it all day and haven't come across a single glitch, so it
 looks solid. I greatly appreciate your help.
