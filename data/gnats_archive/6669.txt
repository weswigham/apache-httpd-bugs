>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 98, binary build
>Description:
In case of using Apache on Windows 9x platform, images in an html
document (via <img>-tag) are not completely transferred if the
corresponding (binary) file contains the byte 1AH (= end of file).

In practice, browsers present no or only shortened images.
Surely, this problem occurs also for other binary file types.

The transfer is stopped at the byte before 1AH by the apache
server. In the log file, only the reduced file size is noted
i.e., only a reduced file is transmitted.

The file size as noted in a directory index seems to be OK.

The problem does not occur for UNIX operating system.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add an image file (*.jpeg, *.gif) to an HTML document. The image
file must contain the byte 1AH before its real end.
>Fix:
The number of bytes to be transferred should be taken from the
API function not from the position of an 1AH byte. The end-of-
file byte should be used only in the case text files to
terminate the transfer.
