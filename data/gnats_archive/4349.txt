>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Server SP 4 We use the ready compiled binary version - no compiler
>Description:
Our problem was reported for version 1.3.2 in your bug knowledge base (number 3064). It isn´t solved in version 1.3.6.
We got the following problem:
With a perl 5 (Win32) script we would create some files on other servers than the server running Apache 1.3.6. For this we need to use UNC names. Now if we start the NT-Apache service with the account of a domain administrator (security problem!), the files are created correct. If we start the service with the NT system account, the files can´t be created. The perl error message is that the directory or the filename are not found. We controlled the permissions on the servers. The permissions are ok. 
We tested to create a local file with the complete local path (e.g. c:/programme/test.txt). The file is created correct when running the Apache service with the NT system account. We only get the problem by using UNC names.
>How-To-Repeat:
Perhaps try it with a simple perl script that only creates a file.
If you need a script example, please contact me.
>Fix:
You can fix the problem by using a domain administrator account for starting the Apache NT service. This is a big security problem.
Another problem is that if you start the service not with the NT system account, the perl ODBC addon doesn´t connect to the database.

Comment-Added:
You aught to create a user account with lower privilage
than administrator, but sufficient privilages to access
the local and networked files, as well as run as a service.
You will find the forthcoming release 1.3.13 docs will
include the topic of running as another user.
