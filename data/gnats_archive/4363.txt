apache version 1.3.6
installed from apache_1_3_6_win32.exe
>Description:
After first installing apache and trying to run it I got the following error :
C:\progra~1\apache~1\apache\apache.exe: cannot determine local host name
Use the ServerName directive to set it manually

I searched the bugs database and found a couple of questions relating to this 
issue and it seemed that if I went into the httpd.conf file and uncommented the
servername and renamed it localhost it should work.

This solved the problem and it appeared to work fine.  But upon opening 
netscape (V4.5) and typing in the address I got the message unable to locate 
server.  I typed the following address : http://localhost:80/listing4_4.html
where listing4_4.html is an html file located in the htdocs directory.
In the httpd.conf file the port is still set to 80.  If I comment the 
servername out apache refuses to run.

Is there something I've missed or not setup properly??

[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!
