Linux 2.4.9 
ext2 fs
>Description:
On a high load server I run, its been observed that a log file reaching the ext2 filesize limit of 2GB causes an unexpected exit on the part of the child process during its attempt to log the access. Once the connection is made by the client and the request sent, the connection terminates without any response. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Load a log file with 2GB of data on a Linux ext2 based system and attempt a page retrieval.

 For further reference, a "good" request will output the full response 
 before terminating (the child process still segfaults) in the case of the 
 transfer log being full, but a "bad" request (404, what have you) 
 terminates if the error log is full without sending data. Either way, the 
 child still dies.
