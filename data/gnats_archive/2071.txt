Checked everything I could find on your site for similar problem and 
found only a report on leaving .exe off shebang line for perl.
>Description:
Error log entry:
[Fri Apr 17 01:11:33 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn
child process: c:/internet/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin/env.pl

Transfer log entry:
207.213.5.209 - - [17/Apr/1998:01:11:45 -0700] "GET /cgi-bin/env.pl HTTP/1.0" 500 389

Tried w/wo (.exe extension, shebang switches, and \r on shebang line and full doc).

Script runs from cmdline.

Tried a couple of user/group combos (commented out now).

Perl crashes if I remove the -w switch from the shebang line.

Tried lots of scripts that worked under Website, none work.

The scripts are being found by the server because changes to the shebang line
affect the operation.

Tried putting ls.exe in cgi-bin and renaming it to ls.cgi and got the 
same result (spawn error).

I tried configuring .bat file as CGI and it just printed the content 
instead of executing it although it did prepend C> to the result:

#!c:/command.com
echo Content-Type: text/plain
echo
echo I:/gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/ls.exe *.*
I:/gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/ls.exe *.*

Except for CGI execution, the server seems fine.  Very fast and reads 
all of my .htaccess files etc (that I use on my ISP's Linux system).

All of my pages are CGI generated though, so basically nothing works 
for my duplicate home website situation.  :(
>How-To-Repeat:
I can supply .conf files in reply to email request, but I'm using dialup 
to net and running only on local machine.
>Fix:
No, I'm a Unix kinda guy stuck on Windoze. :)

I'd be glad to try 1.3b5 if binaries are available
