>Description:
My ISP is AOL.  Saturday night and today I have been trying to access ebay.com and I keep getting a page that says the Apache Web Server is installed on this web site.  I am very frustrated and angry because I have auction sales I must reply to on ebay and can't get through.  Can this be resolved before 3 PM today, March 14, 1999??????

State-Changed-Why:
I am very frustrated and angry that people keep submitting
bug reports about Apache because they see a site using the
Apache software.

If you saw a page saying "Microsoft IIS is installed on this
machine", would you go complain to Microsoft?  Of course not!

We just make software for crying out loud, we can't control
how people use it.
