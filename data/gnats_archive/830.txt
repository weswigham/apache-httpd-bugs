>Description:
While unpacking the new apache_1.2.1.tar.{Z,gz} distributions, I constantly get
a "premature EOF" error around suexec.h.

Happens on binary FTP downloads from a couple of mirrors, including ftp.epix.net,
and from HTTP download.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using command 
gzip -dc apache_1.2.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
or
zcat apache_1.2.1.tar.Z | tar xvf -
>Fix:
Check and rebuild the tarfile

State-Changed-Why:
It appears that /usr/bin/tar on SunOS 4.x doesn't quite
like the tarball for some reason; there may be some extra
blocks at the end it isn't properly ignoring, or something
similar.  In testing on SunOS 4.x, it uncompressed the
archive fine (the last thing should be the logs subdirectory),
so the error can be ignored.

Not sure there is anything worthwhile we can do about it...
doesn't happen on other platforms I have tested.
