>Description:
On loading some servlets, this error message appears in mod_jserv.log. The
browser is returned a page telling it an error has occurred. The statis is
200, and the error is "OK".

It seems to happen more often when reloading a servlet than when fetching it
initially.

Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. This is not a terribly useful
error message - a response to a previous bug report suggested looking in
the source code to find the reason.

Scanning the source seems to point to the error being generated from the
funtion compat_scan_script_header_err_buff in jserv_compat.c (in mod_jserv).

The call to "log_reason (malformed, r->filename, r)" would seem to log the
reason it thinks that headers are malformed, but the output of this does not
seem to appear anywhere.

Interestingly, the servlet that reports this error most often worked fine with
the 0.9 release of mod_jserv. The headers it reports back (assuming you can
fetch it) are below. It returns an Expires: header, and a Last-Modified: header.

 Not sure if replying to this mail will go anywayere, but I have more
 information. I can reproduce the bug, and have a workaround.
 
 The chain of functions is convoluted, but I can now easily reproduce the
 problem.
 
 First, you need a servlet that returns a "Last-Modified" header. The
 idea here is to produce a 304 response code. Telnet to the web server on
 the appropriate port, and type "GET /servlet/uri HTTP" (press enter
 twice) where /servlet/uri is the URI of your servlet. Copy the date from
 the Last-Modified line.
 
 Now telnet again, and type:
 GET /servlet/uri HTTP
 If-Modified-Since: date
 
 (press enter twice)
 Here, "date" is the date you copied from the Last-Modified header on the
 previous request. This should produce the error. (If the date you supply
 here is less than the date returned previously, you get the correct
 output from the servlet.)
 
 Basically, the function ap_meets_conditions (in Apache 1.3.6 core code)
 correctly decides that it should send a 304 response. This 304 gets
 returned to ap_scan_script_header_err_core (in Apache 1.3.6 core code).
 This gets returned to ajpv11_handler (in Jserv 1.0 code). Oddly,
 ajpv11_handler barfs if it gets a non-zero response back.
 
 The function ajpv11_handler is getting a 304 back, and so it is giving
 this error message. This is weird. I suspect perhaps it shouldn't die if
 it gets anything non-zero back. IMHO, 304 isn't an error condition.
 
 As a workaround, if you stop your servlet sending a "Last-Modified"
 header, the problem goes away.

 ben,
 
 Could you please try the latest cvs version of Apache JServ and let us know
 if the problem has been fixed for you? We have switched to a new version of
 the ajp protocol and this issue may have been resolved already. Note that
 you need to edit your configuration files to reflect ajpv12 instead of
 ajpv11.
 
 thanks,

 Hi.
 
 I haven't had a chance to fully test the code, but the piece of code that I
 believe to be incorrect is essentially unchanged in the new version.
 
 The old version of jserv_ajpv11.c, lines 419-426 are:
 
 >     /* Receive the response from JServ */
 >     ap_hard_timeout("ajpv11-read", r);
 >     if (ret=ap_scan_script_header_err_buff(r,buffsocket,NULL)) {
 >         ap_kill_timeout(r);
 >         jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_EMERG,cfg,"ajp11: %s",
 >                     "cannot scan servlet headers");
 >         return SERVER_ERROR;
 >     }
 >
 
 In the new version, lines 462-469 of jserv_ajpv12.c read:
 
 >     /* Receive the response from JServ */
 >     ap_hard_timeout("ajpv12-read", r);
 >     if (ret=ap_scan_script_header_err_buff(r,buffsocket,NULL)) {
 >         ap_kill_timeout(r);
 >         jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_EMERG,cfg,"ajp12: %s",
 >                     "cannot scan servlet headers");
 >         return SERVER_ERROR;
 >     }
 >
 
 The problem is how the return code form ap_scan_script_header_err_buff is
 handled. It seems that ap_scan_script_header_err_buff returns the HTTP status
 of the request. In the case of something like a 304 response, both of these
 pieces of code will signal an error. The if statement is checking for non-zero
 responses. If it gets a 304, it thinks it is an error.
 
 This is what was happening with my servlet that generated a Last-Modified
 header. I found this by changing lines 466,467 (in the old version) to
 something like:
 
 
 >         jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_EMERG,cfg,"ajp12: %s %d",
 >                     "cannot scan servlet headers", ret);
 >
 
 This showed that ret had a value of 304. Definitely not an error.
 
 I will try to find some time to test the code, but unfortunately I am a bit
 busy this week. :(

 Hi.
 
 OK - I have had a play with the new version (Apache-JServ-19990802). I had a
 few problems building it:
 
    * line 429 of jserv_ajpv12.c has a C++ style comment. My C compiler (gcc
      2.6.3) barfed on this, but easily fixed.
    * the Makefile for src/c now requires gnu make where it didn't before - no
      problem as I have gnu make
 
 Basically, I couldn't get it to work correctly. Once running, when I try to
 fetch the SnoopServlet, I just get continual (like, generated once every
 second) messages in my jserv.log file like:
 
 > [03/08/1999 20:50:05:299 EDT] Connection from localhost/127.0.0.1

 And the browser never gets the servlet output back.
 
 The initialisation messages in jserv.log are as follows. Note that I have
 disabled class reloading, and that I am using port 9007 rather than 8007. (I
 have a web server already using 8007 running JServ 1.0 that I don't want to
 kill.) I have set this new port in both jserv.conf and 9007.

 The following servlet code demonstrates the bug rather well. Compile up this
 code (call it Tester.java), and place the Tester.class file somewhere JServ
 will see it. For argument's sake, we'll assume the URL is
 http://my.server/sevlet/Tester.
 
 Fetch http://my.server/servlet/Tester using your favourite browser. (I suspect
 all browsers will trigger this bug.) Once you get the page ("This servlet
 reports that it was last modified on Thu, 11 Feb 1999 22:25:49 GMT"), click
 reload/refresh. This should give you an error page, and generate the "cannot
 scan servlet headers" message in your jserv.log file.
