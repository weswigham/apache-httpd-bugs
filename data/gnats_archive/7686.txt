>Release:        2.0.16
>Organization:
>Environment:
Solaris 8
gcc 2.95.3
OpenSSL 0.9.6
>Description:
I have openssl 0.9.6 installed in /opt/local, on a solaris 8 box.

Using the following configure arguments :

./configure --prefix=/opt/local/apache-2 --enable-tls --with-ssl=/opt/local

This leads to the following configure-time error :
checking for SSL library... checking whether to enable mod_tls... yes
configure: error: no - Unable to locate /opt/local/inc/ssl.h

This is a problem because a default install of openssl doesn't make the directory 
"inc/", so no combination of arguments to configure will make this work on
a system where openssl is compiled from source as standard.



>How-To-Repeat:
Try and compile apache 2.0.16 with mod_tls on a solaris 8 server with 
openssl 0.9.6
>Fix:
Tweak the configure options.  Should be pretty easy.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Wed May  9 03:51:04 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This was fixed after 2.0.16.  Subsequently, mod_ssl 
integration has begun and the old "--with-ssl" option was
renamed to "--with-tls."
