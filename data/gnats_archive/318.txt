GNU gcc
>Description:
I have many virtual sites on my system, and have customized ErrorDocument files primarily for 404 errors.  When upgrading from 1.2b6 to 1.2b7 and testing various sites, I discovered that a 404 error on any virtual site pulled up the ErrorDocument for the first virtual site detailed in httpd.conf.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's a segment of my httpd.conf:

<VirtualHost www.klll.com>
ServerAdmin webmaster@klll.com
DocumentRoot /web/virtual/klll
ServerName www.klll.com
ErrorLog logs/klll.err
TransferLog logs/klll.log
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/virtual/cgi/klll/
ErrorDocument  404 http://www.net-cess.com/other/404klll.html
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.patham.com>
ServerAdmin webmaster@patham.com
DocumentRoot /web/virtual/patham
ServerName www.patham.com
ErrorLog logs/patham.err
TransferLog logs/patham.log
ErrorDocument  404 http://www.net-cess.com/other/404patham.html
</VirtualHost>

A 404 error generated on patham, or even the main site (www.net-cess.com) was redirected to http://www.net-cess.com/other/404klll.html
