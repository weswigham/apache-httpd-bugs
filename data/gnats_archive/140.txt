>Description:
The server is in /usr/local/etc/httpd
I have 2 directories with .rtf files
  /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/docs/dutysheets/groupb   and
  /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/docs/dutysheets/group4   .

AddDescription "SM Duty sheet" "*.rtf"     works fine.

I would like to have 2 descriptions and have tried the following examples without success
AddDescription "SM 4 Duty sheet" "/docs/dutysheets/group4/*.rtf"
AddDescription "SM 4 Duty sheet" /docs/dutysheets/group4/*.rtf
AddDescription "SM 4 Duty sheet" "/usr/local/ets/httpd/htdocs/docs/dutysheets/group4/*.rtf"
Am I doing something wrong? The size of description is ok but I can't seem to point to a directory,
or is it a bug?
Thanks
and have a wildcard at the same time.
