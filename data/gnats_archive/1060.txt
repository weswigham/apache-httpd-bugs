>Description:
I have done an extensive 'find' on my system and cannot find the 
executable for htpasswd so that I can access control certain 
portions of the server.  Is there a place where I can download a 
binary or the source so that I can make it?

Upgrading to a new version of the server is out of the question right
now as we are in the middle of a big project.

State-Changed-Why:
The bugdb is for bug reports, not configuration questions.
You need to unpack the source archive (any version
will do), run Configure from the src directory,
then change to the support directory and do a make.
