>Environment:
Running Linux 2.0.34 (RedHat 5.2), Apache 1.3.3.
>Description:
  Clients accessing my
apache proxy for only *some* ftp URLs get a prompt to enter a username and
password, even when no username is given and anonymous access is supposed to
be the default (ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/ is the famous one; there's one other that
I haven't confirmed).  Entering "anonymous" and "you@me.com" makes it go away,
but it appears for each download and directory change, and doesn't even remember
the last "anonymous" and "me@you.com" password at the very least.

Also, probably related:  All FTP URLs of the form ftp://username@ftp.something.com/
pop up the authentication box, but do not remember the username (i.e., both
boxes are blank).  As far as I can tell, ftp://username@ftp.something.com/ only
serves to pop up a blank authentication box.  ftp://user:pass@ftp.ftp.com/ works
fine, but is not a good choice at all.

The Apache proxy server is nice, and I hope development continues on it.  I
especially would like to see FTP PUTs work, as a normal FTP proxy is terribly
unsecure with the packet access that has to be allowed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using apache 1.3.3 proxy and a Netscape 4.x client, try ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/
>Fix:
I suppose cdrom.com has a special ftp server that challenges Apache.  Apache
might recognize this challenge and substitute anonymous.  Or at least remember
the previous anonymous user and password...

 I'm pleased to announce that I added mod_access, mod_auth, and mod_auth.anon,
 and it seems to work.  Although I figure that mod_auth_anon would have
 done the job alone.
 
 You will still want to check allegations that ftp://user@some.where/ doesn't
 pop up the box with the username filled in.  That is still a problem.
 
 Apache is *kick*ass*, by the way.  Microsucks uses IIS, and it's no wonder
 their site is so sucky.

State-Changed-When: Wed Apr 28 07:11:03 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Some notes on your PR:

If the dialog pops up in the same directory, then probably
logins were refused by the ftp server (too many ftp sessions
active?). When an (anonymous or previously specified 
user+password) login attempt fails, apache replies with the
401 Authenticate code.

When you change directories (towards the root dir), it's
often the browser which doesn't use the same auth info.

Apache ftp proxy doesn't "remember" anything.
It's the browser that remembers a session's user+pass
tuple for a given server.

When you start with ftp://user@host/ in the first place,
apache attempts to log in with the supplied user name,
but when the ftp server replies with a password prompt,
it can only (either try to use a default password or)
return the 401 Authorization Required response to
the browser. However, it cannot make the browser pop
up its password dialog with the username filled in
already. There's no protocol element in the
reply to supply such an initialization string.

#### Reason for SUSPEND state: ####
You say that the addition of mod_access and mod_auth
fixed your problem. If that is so then proxy_ftp should
be fixed to check for the presence of these modules.
The 401 reply should only be returned if mod_auth is
actually available.
