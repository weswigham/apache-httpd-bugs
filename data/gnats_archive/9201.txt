>Description:
I'm not sure if this is a core issue or proxy issue. I assume it's proxy related.
I was trying to test ProxyPass on a server that was configured to listen on 444. There were no other non-standard settings (LoadModule, etc.)
In the server config, I added a ProxyPass, and ProxyPassReverse. I then tried to
access the page on the regular port (80).
The browser came back with "The Page cannot be displayed"
A snoop of the wire traffic shows only tcpip syn and acq, no http data ever crosses the wire.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try placing the following lines at the end of the default httpd.conf
Listen 444
ProxyPass / http://www.apache.org/
ProxyPassReverse / http://www.apache.org

 one more note.
 mod_proxy wasn't compiled into the server, it was loaded using
 LoadModule. There was no
 ClearModuleList, nor was there an AddModule

State-Changed-Why:
I don't see any bug here.  You tell your server to only listen on port 444, then try to connect on port 80.  You can't.  That is all working as it is supposed to.  If you want your server listening on port 80, you have to tell it to.

 here are the steps I did.
 1) set port to 80, which is in the default httpd.conf (or 82 on my
 second instance)
 2) set Listen to 443
 3) ran netstat -an, confirmed that there was nothing "old" listening on
 port 82 or 443
 4) started apache (as a service or from the command line)
 5) tried to connect to slash on port 82
 6) recieved browser error.
 7) when I run a netstat, I see that there is no listener on 80 (or 82)
 
 Why ? Isn't Listen in addition to Port?
