>Description:
I am maintaning the Apache FrontPage port for FreeBSD, and have successfully made the FrontPage module compile with apache v1.2.  Recently, I have modified the FrontPage module to work with Apache v1.3b6 & b8. The b8 version of mod_frontpage.c uses the ap_add_version_component function to add the FrontPage modules version info to the server version.

With out the attached patches, the FrontPage module could not be destributed as a compiled DSO module to Apache 1.3 servers.

Thanks

Scot W. Hetzel

 The only change needed to the patches is to change isspace to ap_isspace.
 
 One thing that I have noticed in going from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1+ is that the
 FrontPage Exts now need "Options ExecCGI" in the access.conf for the
 directory so that FP Exts can execute from user/virtual webs.  This also
 allows users to execute their own CGI programs.
 
 I have additional patches that solve this problem, but they are not quite
 ready. I am trying to add some directives to the FrontPage module so that we
 can still disable/enable FP Exts in certain directories (currently the
 directives are not working, but the patch does work).

Our attention keeps getting fragmented.  Do you have a
version of this patch for 1.3.12?
