>Description:
As reported in other TR´s for the Linux OS, I encounter the same problem when trying to compile Apache 1.3.0 under BSDI  2.0.1 (intel 486 platform).
The others might have found an source for dlfcn.h but I couldn´t.

The output from the compiler:
gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include  -O2 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DHTTPD_ROOT=\"/usr/
In file included from ../../include/conf.h:81,
                 from os.c:6:
../../os/unix/os.h:106: dlfcn.h: No such file or directory
*** Error code 1

Stop.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile under BSDO 2.0.x
>Fix:
Make dlfcn.h available on your site & include it in next release.
