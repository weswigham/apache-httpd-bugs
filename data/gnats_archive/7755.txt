>Description:
When --prefix and -with-layout are used together, the
prefix specified in the config.layout file overrides
the prefix specified on the config line.  The proper
behaviour would be the reverse
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --prefix=/tmp/ap --enable-layout=GNU
make
make install

will cause Apache to try to install most of its files under /usr/local.
(The lib and include files are installed in the correct location
under /tmp/ap).

State-Changed-Why:
I have fixed this problem in CVS.  The problem was that
autoconf sets the prefix variable at strange times while
processing the request, and we try to set it as well while
processing --with-layout.  The fix was to keep track of the
value set using --prefix, and make sure that it is reset
after the --with-layout argument is handled.
