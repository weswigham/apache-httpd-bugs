This bug is independent of the OS and the compiler
used to compile apache because it's about a couple
of mistakes in a sample apache configuration file,
commonhttpd.conf
>Description:
In commonhttpd.conf, there are the following lines
for Korean:    

    AddLanguage kr .kr
    AddCharset ISO-2022-KR .iso-kr

  First of all, the language code for Korean is NOT
'kr' BUT 'ko'. 'kr' is the country code for 
the Republic of Korea (South Korea). ('kp' is
for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea : North
Korea).

  Secondly, virtually nobody uses ISO-2022-KR
for web pages. I have to yet to find a single web page
in Korean encoded in ISO 2022-KR. Most Korean
(except for some new web pages encoded in UTF-8
and X-Windows-949 which is an proprietary extension
of EUC-KR by Microsoft) are encoded in EUC-KR. 
(see http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jshin/faq/qa8.html ).
 
  Therefore, your example above should be:

  AddLanguage ko .ko
  AddCharset EUC-KR .euc-kr

  It'd be very nice if you could kindly address
this soon.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
As I wrote above, two sample lines should read

  AddLanguage ko .ko
  AddCharset EUC-KR .euc-kr
