Sorry for non-Apache question.

My company ( http://www.clustra.com - powered by Apache :) is using GNATS,
and I am in the process of modifying the web interfaces.

Q: Is the Apache GNATS web implementation available?

Q: Is there any mail/news group, or other fora, discussing GNATS?

Regards,
Harald Backer

State-Changed-Why:

You need two files:

<URL:ftp://FTP.Golux.Com/pub/libgnats.pl>
<URL:ftp://FTP.Golux.Com/pub/bugdb.cgi>

That should give you what you need.
