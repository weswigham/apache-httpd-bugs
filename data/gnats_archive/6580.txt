I realized that there is only one icon included in apache, so the start menu looks kind of boring, because all apache icons are the same ;) it would be easier, better and funnier with more icons (*.ico) included with Apache.

State-Changed-Why:

Apache is contributed software.  If you have a suggestion
such as this, provide a contribution instead.

The new-httpd list (see dev.apache.org for related Apache
mailing lists) is the discussion forum for considering new
contributions.

In fairness, however, I don't expect that proposal would
be positively received.  Apache webserver focuses on it's
actual job (serving pages.)  While everyone grants that an
icon isn't unreasonable, you would likely find resistance
to growing that list a dozen fold, purely for decorative
purposes.

But heck, I could be way off base... so offer something to
the list if this interests you.
