NT, but that doesn't matter
>Description:
it's unclear which part(s) of the security tips doc apply to a given
   installation-- a bunch of it seems to apply only to ISPs, where
   untrusted users can publish content.

>How-To-Repeat:
n/a
>Fix:
feature request: it would be awesome if the security tips doc were split
   into N categories, one for each common use of Apache, eg:
1. intranet, ie. behind a firewall and where you trust your users.
2. corporate websites, but where users are not allowed to login to the 
   machine, nor publish content.
3. ISP, where users can publish content.

If I was more of an Apache expert, I'd submit them! (sorry)
