Sun Workshop C/C++ Compiler 4.2
>Description:

I downloaded a binary distribution of Apache 1.3.6. Then I   built a C++ 
DSO using Apache include files on Solaris 2.6 using the Sun 4.2 C++ Compiler. 
Next I added a LoadModule 
line to httpd.conf to load my module and try to start the server. I see 
the following error in the log file and the module doesn't load: 

 [error] Cannot remove module gxapache.cpp: not found in module list 

gxapache.cpp is one of my source files. I can't seem to understand 
what's happening. I tried building and loading the same DSO (again with a binary distribution from apache.org)  on Win32 using MSVC6.0 and it 
works fine. 

Also, when I build the Apache server locally using the Sun 4.2 C compiler and then
try loading the DSO everything works. The problem seems to happen only when I use a 
binary distribution. 

Or there any special compiler options to be used when building my DSO? Or, do I have to use a different compiler, such as GCC?
Is there anything I'm missing? 

I also tried using the 1.3.9 binaries but it still didn't work.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I don't know if it is because of a compiler/flags mismatch. The only fix seems to be
rebuilding the Apache sources locally using the native compiler and then using DSO.

But, that is not an option for us because we don't ship Apache binaries to customers.
