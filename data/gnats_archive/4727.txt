>Description:
Hi,
i would like to use .htaccess on certain cgis in a particular dir.
I have some cgis which are meant to be run only by admin while the rest can be run by the general public.
In my httpd.conf:
<VirtualHost> 
...
AccessFileName  .htaccess
<Directory /opt/VC/TMCWork/cgi-bin>
<FilesMatch  "*admin*.cgi">
        Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride Limit AuthConfig
</FilesMatch>
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

And in the .htaccess in /opt/VC/TMCWork/cgi-bin dir:
AuthUserFile /etc/.htpasswd
        AuthGroupFile /dev/null
        AuthName "Administrative Access"
        AuthType Basic
<Limit GET POST PUT DELETE>
                order deny,allow
                deny from all
                allow from all
                require user setup
</Limit>

But im not getting any protection/validation when i point to the url. All cgis just run without prior validation request.
However when i comment off the <FilesMatch> tag, the validation works ... of course for the whole directory.
Ive tried <Files> tag or different combination for the <FilesMatch> tag. Nothing seems to work.
Any suggestions?
Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
FilesMatch takes a *regular expression*, not a shell-type
wildcard expression.  Use ".*admin.*\.cgi" instead.
