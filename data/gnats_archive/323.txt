>Description:
Whenever I tried to pass any argument to a CGI
script, I got an internal error:

Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete
your request.

Please contact the server administrator, frank@ctcqnx4.ctc.cummins.com and inform them
of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the
error.

The error log says:

 Please try a 1.2b8-dev snapshot from
 
 	http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/
 
 A patch went in after 1.2b7 that fixed some CGI problems on QNX.  This may
 be the same thing.  If that doesn't fix your problem, please provide an
 example of the URL you are trying to use to call the CGI.  There are many
 ways to pass arguments.
