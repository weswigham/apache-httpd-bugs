>Description:

The Java 1.3.0 UrlConnection class does not handle HTTP/1.1 correctly. We are
seeing numbers show up in the content that are correctly removed by browsers 
such as IE5.

It would be nice for the default httpd.conf file to contain something like this:
BrowserMatch "Java/1\.3\.0" downgrade-1.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A seperate issue:

After reading the documentation it seemed to me that 'force-response-1.0' should
be able to do the trick as well, however Apache still gives HTTP/1.1 responses 
(sometimes using content-encoding) when a User-Agent header matches a 
'BrowserMatch "Blah" force-response-1.0' statement.

Example (this particular reply does not happen to use the content-encoding 
I mentioned before but it does show that a HTTP/1.1 reply is given eventhough
the 'User-Agent: JDK/1.0' header should have triggered the BrowserMatch 
statement to give a HTTP/1.0 reply).
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: blah.com:5080
User-Agent: JDK/1.0

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 18 Aug 2000 14:57:33 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) ApacheJServ/1.1.2 mod_ssl/2.6.5 OpenSSL/0.9.5a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In any case, once Apache has been forced to give HTTP/1.0 replies to Java 1.3.0 
browsers, everything works fine. I have not tested this for Java 1.2.
