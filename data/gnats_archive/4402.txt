>Description:
Bug
---

If the src/Configuration.tmpl file is modified to include SharedModule
directives as specified in the DSO manual dso.html supplied with the
distribution, configure fails with messages like
	./configure: module_env.so=yes: not found
	./configure: shared_env.so=yes: not found
	...

Problem Cause
-------------
The manual asks a SharedModule directive to be included like this :
	- Edit src/Configuration:
                      << AddModule    modules/xxxx/mod_foo.o
                      >> SharedModule modules/xxxx/mod_foo.so

However, the code in configure does not take care of the ".so" suffix change
and so the subsequent variable assignment in the configure script fails.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just change any AddModule directive in src/Configuration.tmpl to SharedModule
_and_ change the module's suffix from .o to .so
>Fix:
Suggested Fix
-------------

The change in the context diff below fixes the problem.

State-Changed-Why:

Why are you modifying Configuration.tmpl?  Nothing suggests
that that file be changed, only the Configuration file.
