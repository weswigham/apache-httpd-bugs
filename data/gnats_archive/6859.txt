NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6
Binary install version of Apache Win32
>Description:
All of the 16-bit CGI programs written in C that we have been running successfully in the prior version will not run in Apache Win32 1.3.1.14.

We have been using Apache specifically because of its support on 16-bit CGI.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run any 16-bit "Hello World" CGI program written in C
>Fix:
As an interim fix, can 1.3.1.12 be made available for download until this problem is resolved?

State-Changed-Why:

1. The bug is resolved in the upcoming 1.3.15 release.
   Since apache no longer had any console window (even 
   hidden) old 16 bit cgis would not work.  It's grown
   a hidden window again.
2. 1.3.12 was never removed from the /dist/binaries/win32
   site in the first place.
