>Environment:
Linux 2.0.22, IRIX 5.3
>Description:
Content-Length header not being correctly set by function set_content_length
in http_protocol.c

Result is timeout on sending of HTTP documents to client.  Eventually, all
HTTP data does arrive after output queue is flushed.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://ctest.tool.net has fixed code; will provide test URL if needed.
>Fix:
modify set_content_length:

-sprintf (ts, "%ld", (long)r->finfo.st_size);
+sprintf (ts, "%ld", clength);%0
