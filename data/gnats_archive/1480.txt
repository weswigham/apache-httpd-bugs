Non-core directives, or at least those in modules that are typically
not included in an httpd binary, should be protected in the .conf-dist
files by putting them in <IfModule> containers.  For example, the
proxy directives should appear inside a <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
block.

 Why?  All I can see that doing is confusing users.  I don't see many
 problems with people uncommenting things they don't want to, and having an
 error message pop up if they uncomment them without having the module in
 is a good thing.
