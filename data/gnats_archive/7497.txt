>Description:
Firstly, this appears related to the report noted at:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-new-httpd&m=98581718124826&w=2

I have marked this report "critical" for the following reasons:

1. this occurs after only sixteen (16) requests, not thousands; and,
2. when the error condition is met, Apache loops reporting this error to the
   error_log file at a very rapid rate, chewing up I/O and quickly filling all
   available disk space.

The above report indicates that only a few FDs are probably not being closed and
that these appear to be CGI/pipe-related;  I concur in the second case, this is
definitely CGI-related though I'm concerned that it may be more FDs not being
closed (which would explain why it strikes for me after only a handful of
requests, not thousands).

The only explanation I can see is that I am running PHP 4(.0.5RC4) as a CGI
application (not as an Apache module) performing remote (TCP/IP) database access
and that there are likely more FDs being chewed up and not restored.

The endless loop is the same three system calls:

accept(...) = EMFILE
open("/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/Australia/NSW", O_RDONLY) = EMFILE
write(...) <-- writes "Too man open files..." to error_log

and is triggered by a failed (EMFILE) call to pipe().

This happened in 2.0.14, too.  Due to the endless loop, this means the Apache
alpha can't be left unattended for very long as the processes need to be killed
as soon as the loop begins.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, not available on a public Web server.

The quickest way would be to run PHP 4.0.5RCx (w/built-in MySQL support) as a
CGI application under Apache 2.0.15;  after a handful of pages performing
database requests the Apache server enters the infinite loop.
>Fix:
The aforementioned thread (see reference URL) discusses ways to fix the basic FD
leak, though that is in the "thousands of requests" circumstance;  I am not sure
whether this is enough for this case which occurs quite quickly (only 16 requests
before the infinite loop begins).
>Release-Note:
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Sun Apr  1 00:15:49 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The file descriptor leak was fixed a few days ago (at the
time of the thread you noted on new-httpd) and will be in
the next release.

Thanks for the report, and thanks for using Apache!
