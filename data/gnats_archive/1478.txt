(both Sparc and Intel)
>Description:
Virtual hosting is not working. Instead of serving from the proper
directory, 1.3b3 always serves from the FIRST DEFINED virtual server.
>How-To-Repeat:
If you cannot reproduce this, I will gladly set up an example and give you
access to my server. But since it happened on both an i386 and a Sparc running
Linux, I suspect you'll be able to get the same result.

 Have you read the documentation? 
 
 www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/
 
 Suffice it to say that I cannot reproduce your problem.  If you have read
 the docs and the examples in the docs and you still cannot get it to work
 then please send the smallest example config file which shows the problem.
 
 Thanks
 Dean

State-Changed-Why:
There have been a *lot* of changes in 1.3b3 in the way
Apache handles virtual hosts, particularly name-vhosts
(ones that share an IP address).  Please read the new
documentation at <http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/>
and see if it addresses your problem, and let us know
if it does not.  (Or if it does, for that matter, so
we can close this report if so.)
