FreeBSD kerndev1.yahoo.com 3.4-STABLE
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
>Description:
The file name "alloc.h" conflicts with the C++ standard library file "alloc.h" 

C++ programs that use -Iapache/src/include and try to use C++ library includes (e.g. <vector.h>
get the apache alloc.h and barf.
>How-To-Repeat:
#include <httpd.h>
#include <vector.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        return 0;
}
>Fix:
Suggest changing the file name to ap_alloc.h - there is only one include of it (httpd.h)
and the Makefile.tmpl files will need to be update with a "make depend"

The file is included in httpd.h, so most external code will not include it directly.

I've verified that this fix works in my environment.

Comment-Added:

The fix was -much- larger than that, once you consider all
the .in, .mak, .dsp and .impl files in Apache that included
alloc.h as a dependency :)

The fix you request has been implemented in the forthcoming
release of Apache 1.3.13.  Thank you for your report and
interest in the Apache project.
