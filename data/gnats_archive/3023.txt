 Eeschk..  My tests wasn't any good.  This patch should work:

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: fielding
State-Changed-When: Mon Dec 28 05:08:00 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:

The "Pragma: no-cache" has no meaning in a response for
HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1, regardless of what some other applications
do in reaction to that field.  Also, the no_cache indicator
in the request_rec exists ONLY to replicate the functionality
of the Vary field in HTTP/1.1.  It is therefore not appropriate
to add Pragma or Cache-Control to such responses.
If such is desired for specific resources, then it would
be better to use mod_headers to directly control these
fields.
