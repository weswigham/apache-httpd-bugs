>Description:
This one isn't such a big deal, but thought you guys might want to know about it.
We are moving all of our client data over to a Network Appliances NFS Toaster.  The problem
is that when the server is started, and there are no log files for a virtual the server
creates them right away when the owning UID is still 0.  After the switch to
the 'real' UID the server can no longer write to the files.  This isn't really
an apache problem per se but I thought that it may be something you wanted to
look at in the future if it's a simple procedural change within the code. 
>How-To-Repeat:
If you really needed to I could probably find a way to demonstrate it to you.  Just
email me.
>Fix:
Well, just as an in-house kludge, I went into the source and added a chown(2)
after all the log file opens, this wouldn't be a fix though

State-Changed-Why:
This is probably an issue with a "feature" in the way
Linux does NFS writes.  On any sane system, if you open
a descriptor as root then change uids to another uid,
you should still be able to write to the open descriptor.
The log files are purposely created as the user that
starts the server (ie. normally root) for security
purposes; otherwise anyone who could run something as
the user the server runs as could mess with them.  Note
that if the user the server runs as has write permissions
to the logs directory (not just the files in it), then
anyone who compromises that ID can get root easily.

Also note that when logging via NFS you are not necessarily
guaranteed that writes to files opened with O_APPEND will
be atomic, so you may get intermingled entries.

Something similar is reported in PR#452.

Unfortunately, there is really nothing Apache can do.
