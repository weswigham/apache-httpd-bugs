>Description:
A few weeks ago, I downloaded the newest release of Apache: 1.3.6. I installed it on
my Windows NT system by using the old config files. Now I saw, that the authoristion
doesn't work anymore. So I reinstalled the 1.3.4-Version and it worked.

I defined the authorisation in htaccess-files. I used BASIC-Mode.

What did I wrong? Was it my fault?

Have a nice day,

Michael
>How-To-Repeat:
No, because I installed the old apache again.
