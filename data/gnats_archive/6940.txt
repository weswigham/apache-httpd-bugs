I have checked the news groups, I came across the exact problem with no reply on deja news
dated 27/07/2000

Basically I'm trying to restrict access to files in a directory and sub-directories below using a .htaccess file
with the <FilesMatch> directive and regular expressions.

It seems that if there are more than 3 alternatives in a regular expression separated by | then either access control fails completely - these is no block
or there is a total block.

Here's the content of my .htaccess file.

<FilesMatch "(geog.html|pequod|\.gif)">
  AuthName "geography"
  AuthType Basic
  AuthUserFile /WWW/configs/intranet/conf/wwwusers
  AuthGroupFile /WWW/configs/intranet/conf/wwwgroups
  require group geog

  order allow,deny
  allow from 139.80.64 139.80.76 139.80.28
  deny from 139.80.64.4
  satisfy any
</FilesMatch>

The above construct works. If I come in from an allowed IP 139.80.28.*, then I can see pages geog.html, gifs/*.gif and html/pequod*

If I add an extra alternative such as the following
# does not work <FilesMatch "(geog|hyper|pequod).*|\.gif">
It does not work.
The following do or do not work as marked.
# works <FilesMatch "geog.html|hyper.*|\.gif">
# works <FilesMatch "(geog|hyper).*|\.gif">
# works <FilesMatch "geog.html|pequod.*|\.gif">
# does not work <FilesMatch "geog.html|pequod.*|hyperperth.*|\.gif">
# does not work <FilesMatch "geog.html|hyperperth.*|\.gif">
# works <FilesMatch "geog.html|\.gif">
# works <FilesMatch "geog.html|hyper.*|\.gif">

The error message reported at my netscape browser is

Forbidden - you dont have access to access geog.html on this server, and a similar message in the error log
[Thu Dec  7 14:40:56 2000] [error] [client 139.80.28.37] client denied by server
 configuration: /WWW/intranet/bb/geog.html

Thanks for your help.
