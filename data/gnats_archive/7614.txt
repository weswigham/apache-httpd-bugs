Are there any plans to produce docs in PDF form? Also, our platform is OS/2
and we're using the IBM branded APache server but can't find much info....

Can you help?

Thank you.

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr 24 14:52:51 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

There is a pdf version of the docs in the
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/
directory, but it is for a rater old 
version.  Unfortunately, the docs are written
in HTML format, and while it is quite easy to
convert it to PDF using Adobe web capture,
the results are not very pleasing (out of 
order, etc).

Reagarding third-party distributions of Apache,
you will really need to contact the distributor
for more information (in this case, IBM).

Thanks for using Apache.

 Understand about HTML but not very easily printed whereas a PDF is like a real book. Are there any plans for
 it? Also, are there any plans to add any gui components to the server?
 
 Thanx, Leon

 We will, of course, keep trying to find ways to create better docs.  We
 may have to rethink the entire format to get a decent printable manual,
 however.
 
 Re the GUI, you should ask on a user support forum.  However, I can tell
 you there are several third-party configuration GUIs.  Some of them are
 listed at http://gui.apache.org/
