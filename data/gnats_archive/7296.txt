I ran into the problem on a redhat 6.2 linux box.
>Description:
I have a configuration file with a rewrite map specified. Then I have a rewrite rule that tries to reference the keys in the map. The parsing doesn't work correctly.. I debuged it and here is the change I had to make.

mod_rewrite.c:
  function - static void do_expand(request_rec *r, char *input, char *buffer,
                                   int nbuf, backrefinfo *briRR,
                                   backrefinfo *briRC)


the first if block:

	if (inp[1] == '{') {
	    char *endp;
	    endp = find_closing_bracket(inp, '{', '}');

I changed to:

	if (inp[1] == '{') {
	    char *endp;
	    rewritelog( r, 9, "CALLING find closing with %s", inp+2 );
	    endp = find_closing_bracket(inp+2, '{', '}');

The find_closing_bracket function was getting too deep for the full parse of the line... so I made it pass the first starting bracket. It now works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make any text or rnd rewrite map and try to use it.

ex: main configuration file
RewriteMap server rnd:/home/cholland/apache1317/apache-rproxy.conf-server

RewriteRule ^/(.*)$                   to://${server:static}/$1


Map file:

static cholland|cholland|cholland
dynamic cholland|cholland|cholland


>Fix:
yes:

mod_rewrite.c:
  function - static void do_expand(request_rec *r, char *input, char *buffer,
                                   int nbuf, backrefinfo *briRR,
                                   backrefinfo *briRC)


the first if block:

	if (inp[1] == '{') {
	    char *endp;
	    endp = find_closing_bracket(inp, '{', '}');

I changed to:

	if (inp[1] == '{') {
	    char *endp;
	    rewritelog( r, 9, "CALLING find closing with %s", inp+2 );
	    endp = find_closing_bracket(inp+2, '{', '}');
