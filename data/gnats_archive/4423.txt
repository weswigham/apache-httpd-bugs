>Description:
Possibly the same cause as PR#3389.

Using htpasswd md5 under win32 1.3.6 with password length greater than 8
characters. If the full password is typed in the server errors with password
mismatch. If the first eight characters are typed then server authenticates OK.

Works as expected for passwords <= 8 characters.
>How-To-Repeat:
Intranet. Sorry.
>Fix:
Workaround. Restrict passwords to 8 chars or less.
