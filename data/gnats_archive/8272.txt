>Description:
Please fogive me for bothering anybody if this is a known issue or not valid for any reason. I did
as much research as possible first and can find no other commentary on a problem that I am having
with mod_rewrite and I can reproduce on different machines. 

Basically anytime I am using mod_rewrite to search for a portion of a querystring that is passed to a URI
it does not work.  I have logged the activity extensively and when the "?" is present in a 
URI that is being searched it does not even show the real URI in the rewrite log. 

Note that this DOES NOT HAPPEN if I search for the first part of the URI before the 
qyestion mark (?) and querystring and just say give me all of said URI. 

For Example:
URL:     http://foo?page=3&param=2
Rule:    RewriteRule ^/foo(.*)  http://somewhere/foo$1

this works great even when a querystring is present such as this example URI

however if I search for a specific parameter in the querystring the same URI which
previously registered a hit via mod_rewrite and got redirected is now ignored. 

For Example:
URL:     http://foo?page=3&param=2
Rule:    RewriteRule ^foo(.+)page=3(.*)  http://somewhere/foo$1page=3$2

this does NOT WORK and again the rewrite log shows the URI as everything UP TO the 
? and then it passes every the rule and is not touched.  However in this same example
if I simply remove the question mark (?) from the URI it DOES get redericted and the rewrite
log clearly shows the rule catching the parameter.  

I have tried the rules in many different forms all with the same result (yes, I have 
escaped the ? also, such as ^foo\?(.*)page=3(.*) with the same result.)  I have used 
the same regexp expressions in other formats and they work (sed.)  


This problem only happens when searching for a parameter in the querystring of the URI, if the 
entire querystring is matched it is not an issue.

State-Changed-Why:

RewriteRule's don't match against the query string.
You can instead use a RewriteCond matching against
the variable %{QUERY_STRING} (if I remember correctly;
check the docs for details).

Thanks for using Apache.
