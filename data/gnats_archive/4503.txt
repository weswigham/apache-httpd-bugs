I installed the Apache Server 1.3.3 from the Red Hat Linux 5.2.
>Description:
I installed the Apache Server 1.3.3 from the Red Hat Linux 5.2 for a period of time.
It works fine. I enable its basic security feature, all the user must login with his username and password.
It works in Netscape 3.0 ~ 4.5, IE 3.0 ~ 4.0 (Client Browser version number).
But recently I found that the IE5.0 will not pop up the authentication box for querying the user's username and password.
Instead, it directly display the "Authentication Required ....." message in the browser.
I don't know whether it's a bug or my configuration error. Because it works in the past time on current browser.
It only can't support the IE5.0. So I send this mail to you. Also, I need the answer, too. Thanks.
By the way, if I just use the URL (ex. 192.168.0.99), this problem will appear,
 but if I use the full path (ex. 192.168.0.99/index.html), it will appear the authentication pop up box.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, because its a local LAN, I only public to our local user.
 It contains an illegal IP address in the internet. So you don't have the change to access my server.
But I think it's easy to reproduce in all Apache Servers.
>Fix:
Add some lines in httpd.conf or srm.conf file.

      I think it's not clear enough in my PR post after I read the others PR
 report. So I add some details here, hoping it helps you to verify it.
 Thanks.
 
      ** /etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf **
      DocumentRoot        /home/httpd/html
      DirectoryIndex      main/index.html           (It means the default
 page is in /home/httpd/main/index.html. Is that right?
      ** /home/httpd/html/main/.htaccess **
      AuthGroupFile       .htgroup
      AuthName       ApacheServer
      AuthType       Basic
      <Limit GET>
      require             user admin
      </Limit>
 
      And I still have some other web pages in the /home/httpd/html
 directory. They are accessible for all of the users. If the user want to
 access the web page which is under the /home/httpd/html/main directory, he
 must pass the security check with user name (admin) and password.
      The IP address is 192.168.0.55. (for example) My problem is:
      192.168.0.55/welcome.htm, 192.168.0.55/request.pl works OK.
      192.168.0.55/main/index.html  will appear the Authorization pop up
 box, it's OK.
      But: 192.168.0.55   will appear "(401) Authorization Required ..." in
 my browser. Whatever I tried in srm.conf and the index.html location, it
 still appear this message. It only happen in "IE5.0".         THIS IS MY
 PROBLEM!
      I ever tried to set DocumentRoot "/home/httpd/html" and DirectoryIndex
 "index.html" (/home/httpd/html/index.html) and others doesn't change. The
 index.html will modify to access the files which are in the main directory.
 This can solve the problem a little bit, but the contents of the index.html
 will display in my browser first then pop up the Authorization pop up box.
 I don't want that, it should leave the browser clear until I pass the
 security check. And this will appear another problem: I can try the
 password "Twice": If I fail to login in the index.html, the next access
 will appear the Authorization pop up box again, then I can try the password
 again. (Because the index.html will access the files which are under the
 main directory and the main directory need to pass the .htaccess check.)
 It's not good.  So I need the solution. Thanks for any reply.
