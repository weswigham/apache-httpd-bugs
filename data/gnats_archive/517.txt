Silicon Graphics IRIX 6.2 cc compilier

Possible programming mistake
>Description:
       cc -c   -n32 -O2 -DIRIX   http_protocol.c
"http_protocol.c", line 299: warning(1184): possible use of "=" where "==" was
          intended
           ((r->proto_num >= 1001) && (r->chunked = 1))) &&
                                      ^

>How-To-Repeat:
The second test (r->chunked =1) will always be true so it is
meaningless.

I think you want a "==" instead.

State-Changed-Why:
There's a comment a few lines up in the code about that
assignment, it is intended.  If there's a way to arrange
the code such that irix cc doesn't complain please tell us.
As is we've just arranged it in () which causes gcc to not
complain.

Thanks for using Apache!
