>Description:
Excalibur Retrieval has indexed documents with such filenames as this;

http://hostname.domain/nameoflib/titleofdocument number1.doc ....without error 

yet this filename is appearing in Apache like so;

http://hostname.domain/nameoflib/titleofdocument .

So it appears that everything following the space has been removed this
produces the following error;

file not found

We are wondering if there is any problem with whitespace in urls and this 
version or any version of Apache and if there is a work around.

Can you help please.
Many thanks
Ben Dunlop

State-Changed-Why:
I have no idea what "Excalibur Retrieval" is, but if
it is sending out URLs with spaces in then it is broken.
Spaces are _not_ valid in URLs and, for HTTP, must
be replaced by %20 as per the HTTP spec.
