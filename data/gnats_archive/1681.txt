>Environment:
debian linux 1.3
>Description:
trying to setup authentication for certain pages. the documentation talks about 
naming a "REALM". what's a realm? I've been to apache.org, read all tha FAQ's,
read the debian docs and nothing. I'm sorry I had to use the bug report but 
there's no other way to talk about it.
>How-To-Repeat:
read the documentation on setting up user/password. in a file or using the DBM version
>Fix:
a coupl of sentences on what a realm is

State-Changed-Why:
You should have posted this question to a Usenet newsgroup
or a mailing list.

Also note that 1.1.3 is very obsolete and you shouldn't use it.

As the docs say, it is simply something that is passed to
the client so it knows which "area" on the server you
are authenticating in.  It can be set to anything you
like, but should be unique per server.  Clients often
show it in somewhere in the username and password prompt
they give.
