>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1)
Gnu GCC 2.7.1
Informix ESQLC 7.12 plus CGI-Libraries
>Description:
When porting our domain "www.horizont.net" from AIX to a Solaris 2.5.1
platform a somewhat silly error occurs. Each time trying to make a search
in our Job-database the server encounters an error. The error_log report
an "Premature end of script header error".  Although I have read your FAQ 
this error only occurs under Netscape 3.0 (Gold). There is absolutely no
problem with MS Explorer or Netscape Navigator 4.01. This error only occurs 
under Solaris, not under AIX (no matter if Apache 1.1.1 or 1.2.0) used).

>Fix:
I tried  a lot of fflush() after cgi_print(). Also I tried different 
Apache Versions

State-Changed-Why:
This is a bug in Netscape.  It is sending a CR in the
middle of the HTTP headers when talking to the test server
but not www.horizont.net.  I would guess this is based on either
the length of the hostnames between them or the fact
that one is using a numeric IP address.

You may want to try giving some name like foo.horizont.net
to the new server and seeing if it starts working ok if
you use that instead.  In any case, there is nothing Apache
can do to workaround it.
