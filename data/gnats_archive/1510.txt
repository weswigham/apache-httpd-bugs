Solaris 2.5; problem applies to all environments
>Description:
I see a couple of mentions of problems which can be solved by including the
LockFile directive in httpd.conf. I've just run into the same problem myself
when I decided to move the server logs to /var/log and away from the config
files. I searched for "logs" in the configuration files and rewrote each
directive to give the full path to the new location I wanted. I then removed
the existing logs directory and found the server crashed when I told it to
reload the configuration. I presume this is because it couldn't create
accept.lock.
>How-To-Repeat:
Rewrite httpd.conf to point ErrorLog, TransferLog, PidFile and
ScoreBoardFile to a different directory. Delete the ServerRoot/logs directory.
Start the server.
>Fix:
I'd suggest including a prototypical LockFile entry in the distributed
httpd.conf file so that an administrator could change all lines containing
"logs" and have the resulting configuration work

The config files distributed with the final 1.3 version
will include all new configuration directives including
the LockFile directive.
