>Release:        1.3.9 and 1.3.12-2
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
RedHat 6.1 
>Description:
Default installation runs fine, but a few configuration changes later and apache would not come backup.  Current config includes 5 name  virtual hosts split between two IP addresses (in addition to the main server on a third IP address).  Not relying on default redhat start/stop scripts. Have also stopped th redhat supplied log-rotation.

History:  version 1.3.9 was dying intermittently (esp. after a config chage, and a HUP), would refuse to restart, except after a reboot.  After the latest crash, a reboot makes no difference.  Have now installed 1.3.12-2 (standard RedHat RPM), no difference at all.  After 1.3.12 install, got periodic warnings about mod_perl possibly crashing the system, disabled mod_perl but no difference.

Strangest of all, no core dumps, no errors get logged in system messages, nor the httpd error logs. All the failed startup attempts end in the same way (as seen with strace -- see below). As part of the startup, the server reads all the config files, opens the required log files, does a chdir("/") ; then a fork() ; and finally a series of munmap() before an _exit(0)

Looked at Problem Report 1522 because the stack trace is very similar to what I have been getting, but the problem here is most unlikely to be related to where the lockfilse are created.  In any case, I am using the default location.

Here is the end of the stack trace:

open("/etc/httpd/logs/awka/access", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0644) = 3
fcntl(3, F_DUPFD, 15)                   = 24
close(3)                                = 0
open("/etc/httpd/logs/ozubulu/access", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0644) = 3
fcntl(3, F_DUPFD, 15)                   = 25
close(3)                                = 0
chdir("/")                              = 0
fork()                                  = 1164
munmap(0x40874000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x402db000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x402da000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40196000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40017000, 4096)                = 0
munmap(0x40013000, 4096)                = 0
_exit(0)                                = ?

>How-To-Repeat:
The server won't come up, won't log error messages, and won't dump core.
