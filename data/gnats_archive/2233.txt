>Description:
I wasn't able to get the mod_usertrack module (Apache 1.3b6) to write a dated
cookie to MSIE browsers and I discovered after looking through Microsoft docs 
that the date string sent to set a cookie must be of the form:

expires=day, dd mm yr 00:00:00 GMT

--while mod_usertrack sets the date with the string:

expires=day, dd-mm-yr 00:00:00 GMT
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to set a cookie with an expiry date to MSIE. Cookie isn't accepted.
Send a cookie without an expiry date and the cookie is accepted.
(Changing the CookieExpires directive from format "2years" to 63072000 will 
not reformat the date string sent to the cookie, BTW)
>Fix:
The fix seems to be to change line 192 of mod_user_track.c from:

"%s%s; path=/; expires=%s, %.2d-%s-%.2d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d GMT",

to:

"%s%s; path=/; expires=%s, %.2d %s %.2d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d GMT",

Recompilation of module code without hyphens has resulted in successfully setting
dated cookies to MSIE 3.x and 4.x on Win95 in addition to Netscape browsers.

State-Changed-Why:
I don't know about that - Microsoft's own servers issue
their expires format the way netscape defined it.  Do a 
HEAD request on www.expedia.com and you'll see the dd-mm-yy
format.  In 10 minutes of searching I couldn't find any
documentation on the www.microsoft.com web site about their
expected formats.

 My apologies for not including the URL of the relevant Microsoft document:
 
 http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/partbook/instantj/html/javascriptcooki
 es.htm
 
 This is (was) the only reference to by-hand date formatting of cookies on
 the entire site and now it seems not to exist anymore although, as you
 probably saw, it is still listed as available by the site search.
 
 I printed a copy of the doc before it disappeared and I will fax it to you
 if you are interested in looking it over. Please let me know.
 
  In short, the document states:
 
 "The date for 'expires' requires the exact format that the toGMTString()
 method of the date object produces:
 
 //example date: 'Mon, 13 Oct 1997 12:40:34 GMT'	"
 
 Of course we are dealing with Microsoft's JavaScript  here and not
 something explicitly server/cgi-generated however my results from resetting
 the line of code in mod_usertrack.c *did* result in my setting a persistent
 cookie, one written to the Cookie file, where I hadn't been able to do
 before with the standard build.
 
 I checked www.expedia.com and didn't find any "expires="-style Set-Cookie
 header at all.
 
 I did, however, find a Microsoft server, www.nomade.fr, which set a cookie
 to all of my browsers using the Netscape (with hyphens) method.
 
 So, I'm now not so sure of the validity of my orginal bug post. Still, the
 sans-hyphen method is the only one which works for my MSIE 4.x Win32 from
 Apache and I will use my own build for a forthcoming version of our server.
