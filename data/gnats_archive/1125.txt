>Release:        1.3a1
>Environment:
Windows NT, 4.0, SP3.  VC++ 5.0.
>Description:
The handling of nph- cgi programs presently prevents binary data, such as GIFs from being sent.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Add a few null bytes in the middle of an output stream from an nph- type of
 cgi program.
>Fix:
We worked around this with very minor changes in alloc.c and mod_cgi.c.  alloc.c creates a binary pipe when the child is nph.  mod_cgi.c has a loop using fread and bwrite instead of fgets and bputs.  

We will provide our changes if desired
