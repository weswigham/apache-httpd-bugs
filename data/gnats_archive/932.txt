>Description:
When viewing www.apache.org's instructions on applying patches, the example uses a less-than sign for input redirection, which of course, causes the filename to not show up on some browsers, since it is seen as an html tag.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at your patches directory page on your web server, I know at least MS IE 3.0 doesn't show the filename
>Fix:
use &lt; instead of "<", but you know that alread

Fixed, I think.  I'm not sure exactly which page you are
referring to, but I think I found them all.  Let me know
if I missed the one you are thinking about.
Thanks.
