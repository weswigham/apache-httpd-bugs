Hi!

The proxy server doesn't recognize URLs with other ports than e.g.
port 80 (using http://) for the NoProxy - directive:

  e.g.:

       ProxyRemote http://blabla.firewall
       NoProxy     http://server1.domain

  Requesting data from http://server1.domain works file.
  Requesting data from http://server1.domain:88 will connect to the
  remote proxy (should be a direct connect to server1)!

  Adding the directive:  "NoProxy http://server1.domain:88" to the config
  fixes the problem (workaround). But the error log shows the following line:

    "@@@@ handle optional port in proxy_is_hostname()"

  This keeps the error logs growing fast...

State-Changed-Why:

You are using the wrong syntax for the ProxyRemote
and NoProxy directives.
ProxyRemote needs a 'match' argument and
NoProxy can take a hostname, domainname, IP address
or subnet address as an argument, but no URL.

See the mod_proxy documentation for details.
