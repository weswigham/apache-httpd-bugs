Linux 2.2.19
>Description:
My machine has a non existing hostname (not present in /etc/hosts and DNS) 
and wil SIGSEGV in routine ap_get_local_host().

In this routine the functions gethostbyname() and find_fqdn() are called and 
will both return a NULL pointer. The code will then try to dereference the NULL
pointer causing the violation.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Set the machine hostname to a name not present in /etc/hosts and DNS
2) start httpd

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your report.  A fix very similar to your patch was
committed to CVS a few weeks ago.  The problem will be resolved
by the next 1.3.x release.

Thanks again, and thanks for using Apache!
