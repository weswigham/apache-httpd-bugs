Linux beholder 2.2.1 #101 Fri Feb 5 16:17:12 EST 1999 ppc unknown

gcc version egcs-2.90.25 980302 (egcs-1.0.2 prerelease)
>Description:
Apache will not compile on LinuxPPC R4.  I get the following error:

gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DLINUX=2 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I
../../lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED `../../apaci` os.c

>How-To-Repeat:
Try to compile the latest apache on LinuxPPC.  I know that 1.3.4 was compileable since that is the last version I installed.
>Fix:
No, but I would be happy to provide access to my server to someone in the Apache group who was qualified to fix it.

State-Changed-Why:
This is some problem with your system header files.  Your include
files and your kernel are probably out of sync; in any case,
it is a Linux issue not an Apache one.
