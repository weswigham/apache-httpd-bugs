 hi Magnus.
 that file should exist.
 but linux shouldn't require it.
 what type of PC are you running on ?
 
 better yet.
 can you run a fresh checkout/update and see if the file=20
 is there after that.
 
 Thanks
 Ian

 Hi!
 
 I'm on an i586. But I solved it by removing atomic/unix
 from Makefile in srclib/apr after I had run ./configure.
 So now it seems to work.
 
 There's probably some better way around this.
 
 But if it doesn't require it on an Intel platform, why does
 it create it when I run ./configure ?
 
 If you want o know more about my PC:
 Dell something.
 Intel MMX CPU 166MHz
 32MB SDRAM
 2GB HDD
 Some other not important stuff in it like NICs etc..

 here's the thing.
 if there is a Makefile in there
 there should also be a 'makefile.in' in there as well.
 (how else could the makefile get there otherwise)
 
 can you do me a favor and do
 cvs -q up -Pd
 
 and a './buildconf'
 
 or reget the cvshead in a seperate directory.
 
 I've tested this on 4 different linux machines (one a dec alpha)
 and they all appear not to have this problem
 
 (or the mod-mem-cache one you reported as well)
