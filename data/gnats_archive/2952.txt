>Description:
When installed as a service, Apache starts OK with a defelt httpd.conf.  I added a section for a virtual host , using just the DocumentRoot and cluase (also tried with and without the ServerName clause, and with/without the NameVirtualHost clause.  Any combination caused Apache to not start (using either "net start apache" or from ControlPanel/Service).

When run as an application, everything work OK.

Nothing in error.log indicating a problem.  I don't see anything that looks like a core file (or whatever the NT equiv is).
>How-To-Repeat:
My section of http.conf for redirecting to a web follows:

NameVirtualHost 24.1.86.37

<VirtualHost www.natpulse.com>
#ServerAdmin guys@home.net
#ServerName www.natpulse.com
DocumentRoot "c:/FrontPage Webs/Content/natpulse"
#ErrorLog logs/natpulse-error.log
#TransferLog logs/natpulse-access.log
</VirtualHost>
>Fix:
No.

 Erm... www.natpulse.com doesn't exist, doesn't have a DNS entry, etc.
 what do you expect it to do?

 Thanks for the reply.  My DNS server entries were botched up, but the local cache was allowing me to access the local web server OK.  With luck (and the 12 hour refresh) the DNS entry will be back (assuming I haven't fat fingered something else).
 
 The basic symptom though (Apache stopping at start-up as a service and not an application) still holds.  It starts as a service when VirualHost is not in use, but crashes as a service when it is.  If it were a DNS issue, I would think it would affect bot h.
