>Environment:
Win NT 4.0 Service Pack 4
downloaded apache_1_3_3.exe from www.apache.org (via download.com)
filesize 2,855,288 
>Description:
I downloaded it, ran it, the installshield thingy all worked fine.
The executables don't show icons (eg. when viewed in Explorer), is this normal?

When trying to execute:
E:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache>apache
fopen: No such file or directory
httpd: could not open document config file E:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\Apache/conf/httpd.conf

(first time i've been able to install something on linux easily but not on windows.. )
Great website, btw. thanks for your time
>How-To-Repeat:
Find an nt4sp4 box, go to www.download.com, search for "apache", download from www.apache.org, run the .exe you get, reboot when it says (incidentally when i clicked for reboot, it only logged off and i had to reboot manually) and then run apache.exe
>Fix:
Probably something simple but I don't see appropriate docs

State-Changed-Why:
First, please download it from www.apache.org/dist/, not some
third party site.  That way you get the current version, not
an obsolete one.  We ask clearly before you submit a PR to
be sure you are using the current version.

Which type of install did you do?  ie. custom, default, etc.
Try doing the default install.

Look for a .tmp directory or something along those lines
with httpd.conf in it; it is possible that the installer
failed to properly install the config files.  If they are
there, you will have to manually go through them and replace
the strings surrounded by @@ with the proper directories.
