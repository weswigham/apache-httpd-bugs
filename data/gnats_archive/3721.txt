OS: Solaris 2.6 with latest patches
Hardware: Sun Ultra-1/140
Compiler: cc: SC4.0 18 Oct 1995 C 4.0
>Description:
If a *directory* name (e.g. `foo.bin') has a "common file suffix" (here: `.bin'),
mod_autoindex shows the *file* icon (here: `binary.gif') instead of the
directory icon (here: `folder.gif') given that you used

	IndexOptions FancyIndexing
	AddIcon /icons/binary.gif .bin .exe
	AddIcon /icons/folder.gif ^^DIRECTORY^^

in your httpd.conf. 

IMHO mod_autoindex should apply those icons to regular files only, not to 
directories. For directories it should always use `folder.gif'.
>How-To-Repeat:
- make sure you have Apache 1.3.4 with mod_autoindex compiled in
- Create a directory `foo.bin' inside directory `bar'
- Make sure that the following appears in your httpd.conf:
	IndexOptions FancyIndexing
	AddIcon /icons/binary.gif .bin .exe
	AddIcon /icons/folder.gif ^^DIRECTORY^^
- let apache show a directory listing of `bar'
- look at the icon before `foo.bin' -- it's `binary.gif' instead of
  `folder.gif' :(
>Fix:
mod_autoindex should always show `folder.gif' (or whatever is declared for
^^DIRECTORY^^) for *directories*. Other icons declared for certain suffixes
should be applied to *regular files* only.

State-Changed-When: Tue Aug  7 07:17:13 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

This is a very well put argument to always use AddIconByType
or AddIconByEncoding, since directories aren't subjected to
these categories.
