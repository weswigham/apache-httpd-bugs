Why do you think buffering makes it slow?  Are you sure
it isn't just a perception?  What are the pages doing
that takes so long that the buffering would slow it down?

 Unfortunately it's hard to "not buffer" the page ... even 1.1.3 buffered,
 but it only buffered up to 1024 bytes.  1.2 buffers up to 4096 bytes, and
 it does that deliberately to avoid sending extra packets on the net.  To
 change that value, edit buff.c and change DEFAULT_BUFFERSIZE from 4096 to
 something lower... you could probably even use 576 which a typical MTU for
 serial lines.  This affects your entire server, and could degrade
 performance by generating more packets than strictly necessary.
 
 Another alternative is to not use SSI and use CGI completely, using the
 nph- "hack".  But I hate advocating that.
