State-Changed-Why:
We can not support third-party software, especially that
which is as big of a messy hack as frontpage.  

As indicated, PRs are for bugs, not configuration questions.
We do not have the time to assist 500,000 users in configuring
their server.  Please try the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
newsgroup or one of the several areas on the web t hat provide
FrontPage information.
