>Description:
Apache allows displaying directory content.
It would be nice if you could do not only http://server/directory/
but also http://server/directory/File*
The display would only show files named File* instead of issuing a "Not found".
I know apache is not a file explorer but then, on my server it would be nice.
>How-To-Repeat:
Type http://server/directory/File*
>Fix:
Allow regexp to be used to filter directory listing in case directory could be found but not
file name.
Probably need additional config info to specify whether to turn it on or off.

State-Changed-Why:

Interesting idea.  If you would like to submit a patch
to do this, it would be considered.  However, I don't
think this functionality is high on anyone's priority
list to add at them moment.  I will suspend this report
so that if anyone is trying to enhance mod_autoindex
in the future they can consider this.
Thanks for using Apache.

State-Changed-Why:

The change you request is likely to be viewed more as a
potential exploit than a feature, URI's aren't the same
as shell filepaths.  However, it's an interesting concept
when the administrator has choosen to allow autoindexes,
so the Query option ?P=pattern will accomplish the same,
with appropriate restrictions, in Apache 2.0.23.
