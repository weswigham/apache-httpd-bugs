OpenBSD2.4 - all general patches
>Description:
A stement in .htaccess like the following should deny all non-.html files
from being served:
<Files ~ "!\.html$" >
deny from all
</Files>

Reality: the ! is not recognized as a negative match operator. All possible
syntax/combinations of ! have been tried:
!"\.html$"
"!(\.html)$" etc.

This is important so that .htaccess and .htpasswd files can be denied -
even for users that have successfully authenticated following .htaccess
rules. .htaccess parsing is before "Files", so the "Files" part has
to be in the .htaccess part by itself: deny all .ht* files, then selectively
allow all non-.ht* files.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Introduce a first-match exits rule for a sequence of <Files> </Files> blocks,
rather than the "last match sticks" rule. This is in addition to the
missing negation operator really.

State-Changed-Why:
We won't be making such changes in 1.3.x... but it should
be considered for the new config language.
