>Description:
after reviewing some previous PRs, i now undersand why apache handles files
with names like foo.map.gif the way it does.  however, the documentation 
confuses the issue.  the mod_mime documentation provides some insight into the
way the documentation uses the term `extension', but somebody just looking at
(say) http://www.apache.org/docs/handler.html might be confused by stuff like:

State-Changed-Why:
You are quite right. This is confusing enough without
incorrect documentation making it almost impossible to
figure out. The documentation on handlers and on
mod_mime has been updated with more details about how
files with multiple extensions are treated. I hope this
makes it a bit easier to understand.

although strictly true, this confuses the issue, because actually that statement
makes any file whose name contains `.cgi' to the right of zero or more 
recognized extensions be treated as a CGI.  more accurate documentation here 
and other places where the documentation talks about `files ending in x' would
reduce the likelihood that the naive user will be confused by apache's belief
in multiple extensions.
