>Description:
I can never remember how the order directive works.  It would be easy for
mod_access to warn when a config like this:

order allow,deny
deny from all
allow from a.b.c.d

was used.  It makes no sense -- it denies all access, despite what looks
like an attempt to allow some.  Similarly for:

order deny,allow
deny from a.b.c.d
allow from all

Which allows all access despite what looks like an attempt to allow
some.
