>Description:
in vhosts/details.html
it says "generated an inserted" when it should say "and inserted"

in vhosts/name-based.html
I would suggest saying that ServerAlias is a way to have different url's point to that one vhost
to help people understand what exactly it does (clearer)

also in vhosts/name-based.html
I think you should say "the first virtual host listed for that IP"
instead of "primary name-based virtual host (the first virtual host
appearing in the configuration file for a specific IP address)." to clear things
up and help people understand exactly what happens.  It is less confusing, 
and you can call it primary when they click on the serverpath configuration 
example on the bottom.
