No core dump because of my wierd setup.
The line:
   memcpy(&val[i],&tmp[k],22-k);
in function proxy_hash in modules/proxy/proxy_util.c causes the fault
>How-To-Repeat:
Set cache dir length to 8 and levels to 3

Need to rewrite the MD5 hash code safely, but It's 5:00 on Friday
now, so see ya late

 I don't know.  This problem was a result of an overflow in the hash
 calculation
 of the cache filename.  The problem could be fixed fairly easily by
 calculating
 all of the hash characters first, then using a separate function to convert
 into
 a file/path name.
