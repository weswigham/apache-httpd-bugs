>Description:
I am using the distributed mime.types file, and tar.Z files get the MIME type
text/html.  tar.gz files, on the other hand, get the type application/
octet-stream.  I am not using mod_mime_magic.  There are entries in mime.types
for application/x-compress and application/x-gzip but neither one has any
extensions listed for them.  Question 1: why are the extensions missing from
mime.types?  Question 2: why are the two kinds getting different results? (I
didn't check source code for this).  When I put
   AddType application/x-compress Z
   AddType application/x-gzip gz
in my .conf file then the tar.Z files get the correct type but the tar.gz files
still show application/octet-stream.  Question 3: why the difference?

State-Changed-Why:
There are not supposed to be mime types listed for .Z
and .gz files because the default config file contains
AddEncoding directives for those.  You should be getting
a mime type of something (depending on if it is the default,
if there are any mime types for other extensions, etc.)
with an encoding of x-compress or x-gzip.

Comment-Added:
As Marc pointed out, .Z and .gz don't properly identify
content types, but rather content-encodings.  Remove the
AddType directives you inserted for these, and make sure
your server config files include

  AddEncoding x-compress Z
  AddEncoding x-gzip gz

Reload the server and try to fetch a .tar, .tar.Z, and a
.tar.gz file.  All should show up as application/x-tar
with the Content-encoding response header missing,
"x-compress," or "x-gzip" respectively.  If you don't get
these, your server is probably misconfigured.

 For the record, apache is broken in its handling of this stuff.
 Specifically, if a browser does not send "Accept-Encoding: gzip" (or
 x-gzip), apache should respond:
 
 Content-Type: application/gzip
 
 At the moment it incorrectly responds:
 
 Content-Type: x/y  (the unzipped type, i.e. application/tar)
 Content-Encoding: gzip
