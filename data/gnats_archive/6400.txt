apache
>Environment:
Solaris (SunOS 5.6 sparc Ultra 5)
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
I compiled apache 1.3.12 with ./configure ; make ; make install and no change to
the default configurations whatsoever. I am running the server as a regular user
(not root) on the default port 8080
The problem is that after the first HTTP request, subsequent ones take about a
minute to serve. Turning logging all the way up doesn't show anything when I issue
a GET request, but only after serveral seconds or a minute do they show that
the request was made (and that's when the request is actually being served)
The machine is pretty much idle; what could be causing these delays?
