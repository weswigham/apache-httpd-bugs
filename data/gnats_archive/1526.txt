FAQ 36 says:

Why isn't restricting access by host or domain name working correctly? 
Two of the most common causes of this are: 

An error, inconsistency, or unexpected mapping in the DNS registration 
This happens frequently: your configuration restricts access to Host.FooBar.Com, but you can't get in from that host.

State-Changed-Why:
The text is correct.  It says "restrict access TO", meaning
that host is *supposed* to have access but doesn't.
Thanks for using Apache!
