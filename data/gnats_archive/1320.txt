>Description:
The %t directive for the custom log format reports when the request
is finished rather than when it started.  Whether or not this is
as bug is certainly debatable, but for a project I'm working on, recording
the start of the transaction is important.  (Specifically, I have
apache set up as a proxy to monitor traffic at the client end of a
surfish session, as part of some web site usability testing.)

I've included a patch to mod_log_custom.c that provides the behavior
I need.

State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately we have to use the time the request finished
because that's how common log format is defined ... and many
log analysers assume that the times in the log only go forward...
which is what they appear to do if you use the time() at which
the log entry is written.  (Naturally there are race conditions
that make this false... so those log analysers are just generally
broken.)
