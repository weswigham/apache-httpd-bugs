>Description:
After attempting to upgrade from 1.2.4 to 1.3.4, I discovered that it would not
follow all symbolic links. It will follow links that are internal to the tree.
It will not follow links that are outside of the document root, or that are in
the document root, but fully qualified. I have set up a plain vanilla install
of Apache to test this without .htaccess and such and still have the problem.
Has the method of following links changed between these two versions?

My httpd.conf has the following entries:

<Directory />
  AllowOverride None
  Options FollowSymLinks
  order allow,deny
  deny from all
</Directory>

<Directory /apps/web/htdocs>
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks IncludesNOEXEC
  AllowOverride AuthConfig
  order allow,deny
  allow from all
</Directory>

State-Changed-Why:
My wild guess is that there is a access.conf or srm.conf which
your server is reading which are affecting things.  Try
adding:

ResourceConfig /dev/null
AccessConfig /dev/null

and see if it changes anything.

FollowSymLinks does work for me -- see the shipped
conf/highperformance.conf for example, that follows symlinks
just fine... and looks pretty much like the minimal config
you just posted.

Anything logged if you change LogLevel to debug?
