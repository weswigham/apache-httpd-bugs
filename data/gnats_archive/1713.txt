>Description:
By mistake I named a password-file .htaccess in a directory above the document
root. The result was a "500, internal server error". I tried it on another 
machine and it works for both standalone and virtual servers. With the virtual
server it does not affect the other servers. The errorlog says "Invalid argument:
/home/xxxx/.htaccess: Invalid command: 'text'" 
... time passes ... I just tried putting the .htaccess file in the system root 
and I still get a 500...
I am not sure if this is a bug or just me doing something stupid, but I thought 
you'd like to know.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just write a file called .htaccess and type something like "dklsjf" and see what
happens...
>Fix:
Nope, I'm no hacker..

State-Changed-Why:
There is no bug; that is the way htaccess files work.  They
are searched for from the root of the filesystem all the
way to the directory the file is in, unless you disable
them using "AllowOverrides None".

Comment-Added:
This is the correct behaviour.  A .htaccess file is used
to configure the server's operation when dealing with
that directory; if the .htaccess file contains bogus
information it is naturally a server configuration error.

Thank you for reporting this, though, and for using Apache!
