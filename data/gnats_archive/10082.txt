>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
All OS
>Description:
If you activate authentication in combination with mod_proxy, authentication errors are internally handled as server authentication (401) and then converted to proxy authentication (407). The custom error fetching must be repeated after this conversion.
>How-To-Repeat:
ErrorDocument 401 works (even for proxy)
ErrorDocument 407 does not work
>Fix:
In http_request.c, function ap_die, replace 

   if (r->status == AUTH_REQUIRED && r->proxyreq == STD_PROXY) {
        r->status = HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED;
    }
 by the following
if (r->status == AUTH_REQUIRED && r->proxyreq == STD_PROXY) {
        r->status = HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED;
	error_index = ap_index_of_response(r->status);
        custom_response = ap_response_code_string(r, error_index);
    }


In addition, we should also check that the error document is local (as we do for error 401)
