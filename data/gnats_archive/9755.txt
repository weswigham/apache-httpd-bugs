 Thank you for the response.  I have indeed tried the 2.0.32 beta, with
 the same results.  However, I do not observe the same delay when using a
 browser or using telnet, so I wrote a simple client which merely opens a
 socket and attempts to read a very small amount of data from the server
 (using the 'read' system call) and observed the problem again.  I
 confess I'm mystified.
 
 If you haven't seen this before, I may attempt to attach gdb to a
 single-threaded apache to see what it's doing.
 
 Joe

 This sounds like a HTTP keep-alive timeout issue.  By default, it
 is set to 15 seconds (KeepAliveTimeout in httpd.conf).  If you 
 learn anything more about this, please let me know.  -- justin

 Right you are, tweaking KeepAliveTimeout varies the hang by pretty much
 the value of that value.
 
 I still haven't looked at the apache source (difficult 'cause I'm remote
 at the moment) but it seems to me that, even if it doesn't close the
 socket, apache should flush its output.  Possibly this is a kernel
 problem, but I presume this'll go away if I add the correct HTTP header
 (don't keep alive)...
 
 Any thoughts?
 
 Thanks,
 Joe
