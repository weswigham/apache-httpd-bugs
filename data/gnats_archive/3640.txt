 Problem code seem's to be in proxy_cache.c in function sub_garbage_coll:
 -----
 /* read the file */
 	fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY | O_BINARY);
 	if (fd == -1) {
 	    if (errno != ENOENT)
 		ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, r->server,
 			     "proxy gc: open(%s)", filename);
 	    continue;
 	}
 	if (fstat(fd, &buf) == -1) {
 	    ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, r->server,
 			 "proxy gc: fstat(%s)", filename);
 	    close(fd);
 	    continue;
 	}
 -----
 
 open try to open a directory. I think this doesn't work.

 With suggestions and support from Ben Kummer (KUMMER@vdivde-it.de) I made a
 small bug fix.
 
 Here is the diff command line I used:
 
 diff proxy_cache.c.org proxy_cache.c >proxy_cache.c.diff
 
 The result of the diff is:

 Problem description:
 
 A stat was only made if the file is a .tmp file. Otherwise the file is
 opened (failed for directory on WinNT) and the file desciptor is used to
 call fstat().
 
 I used only one stat() call for all types of files and removed the fstat().
 The file is only opened if it's not a directory.
 
 
 Please review the changes and add it to further Win32 releases
 Thanks
 Klaus Mueller

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for your submission and interest in the Apache project!
The correction you observe has been applied to the
forthcoming release of Apache, version 1.3.13, so that
Garbage collection will no longer fail due to 'stat()ing'
directories.
