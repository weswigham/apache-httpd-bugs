State-Changed-When: Sun Sep 16 15:07:41 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This sounds like a problem with the Upload applet - either
some unix-specific feature (such as updating the file
attributes) or some assumption about threading may be
causing this problem.

Can you reproduce/rule out this problem on Unix?  Can you
diagnose your script to the offending bit of code?

If not, I'm afraid we cannot be of more help on user scripts
or applets, try contacting the author of the upload script
for further assistence tracking down the problem.

Please let us know if this leads you back to code in the
Apache server or Jakarta project.

 I tested that when I made a form submit with method of POST and 
 multipart/form-data to upload file, there's no exception in the Java bean 
 which processes upload file on the server side.
 
 Also, once I suddenly closed the browser during uploading files, Apache 
 server hangs up and consumes 100% CPU resource AND it's hard for me to stop 
 the apache service. BUT there is no problem in tomcat.
 
 According to my colleague, there is the same problem in the application 
 when running in UNIX platform.
 
 Is it a bug of apache, that cannot automatically detect and handle the 
 sudden closure of the stream (connection) between the browser and apache 
 for uploading file?
 
 How to solve that problem?
 
 Joseph.

 How do you come to that conclusion?

 That definately signals a problem in the mod_jk connector.  Apache handles dropped
 perl and other means of scripting POST content quite well.  If, as you claim, Tomcat
 isn't a problem, then the mod_jk connector is the only remaining fault point.  (You
 are using jk, and not mod_jserv, correct?  Which version?)

 What I could see is Apache process consume 100% CPU resource, not Tomcat. 
 And I could stop tomcat process easily, but for apache, I issued a stop 
 command , it took a long long time to stop the apache process.

 Yes, I use mod_jk for Tomcat 3.2.3.
 
 I tried to post that problem in tomcat mailing list, but nobody answers me.
