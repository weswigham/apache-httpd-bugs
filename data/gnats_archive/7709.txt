 FLAX SEED OIL & DEPRESSION
 Newsweek 23/04/01. 'The brain is an astonishing 60% fat and it needs
 Omega-3's to function properly. In a number of recent studies around the
 world a significant link has been established between Omega-3 deficit with
 high rates of mood problems and depression, bi-polar disorder, post natal
 depression and even suicidal tendencies.' Research conducted by Dr Donald
 Rudin has found that Flax Seed Oil supplements benefited almost 2/3rds of
 subjects studied with a reduction in anxiety, stress and tension,
 Flax Seed Oil and enhanced immune response
 Alpha linoleic acid omega-3 is a powerful disease-fighting component of
 flax seed oil. It boosts immune cell response and reduces inflammation in
 the body. It does this by changing the composition of cell membrane
 phospholipids and markedly reducing the production of inflammatory
 compounds that flare up when we fall ill or get injured.
 Flax Seed Oil and heart disease
 Omega-3 fatty acids have been established to lower cholesterol by up to
 25% and triglyceride levels by up to 65% and are being used extensively to
 prevent heart disease. Research published in the Lancet showed that
 Omega-3 in the form of flax seed oil make human platelets less sticky,
 reversing a major cause of strokes and clogged arteries. That's why
 researchers recommend flax seed oil for everyone daily as protection
 against heart attacks and strokes.
 Flax Seed Oil and weight loss
 Amazingly omega-3 fats almost certainly also have important role to play
 in slimming and weight maintenance. They seem to regulate the body's blood
 sugar levels by helping to increase insulin sensitivity, which keeps
 hunger at bay. They increase our metabolic rate so more fat and glucose is
 burned and less deposited as body fat. And they increase our energy levels
 and so encourage us to take more exercise, which builds more muscle and
 lean tissue. This in turn increases our metabolic rate because muscle
 cells are the most metabolically active.This beneficial metabolic activity
 can be blocked by an excess of omega-6 oils.That is why increasingly so
 many top athletes are using Omega Nutrition Flax Seed Oil to increase the
 body's oxygenation so enhancing stamina and recovery times.
 Taste
 Omega Nutrition Flax Seed Oil has a pleasant zesty, organic and fish free
 aftertaste.
 What makes Omega Nutrition Flax Seed Oil SO GOOD?
 To get the very best quality - flax seed oil needs to be processed without
 any chemicals under stringently controlled conditions. That's why Omega
 Nutrition Flax Seed Oil is the best in the world. Unrefined Omega
 Nutrition Flax Seed Oil is extracted from Certified Organic and GM Free
 seeds using the unique Omega flow process. A mechanical extraction process
 where the seeds are carefully and naturally cold pressed in small batches
 at closely controlled temperatures 30-33C so valuable enzymes are not
 destroyed and no trans fatty acids whatsoever are formed and no valuable
 nutrients, Vitamins A, K and E as well as beta carotene, lecithin etc are
 removed. Moreover no additives or preservatives are used. And to prevent
 oxidation any reactive metals, oxygen and light are excluded during
 manufacture and bottling.
