State-Changed-Why:
Please don't just keep submitting useless bug report after
useless bug report.  We don't have time to deal with teaching
people how to use Apache.

Your PR makes no sense.  Why do you think this has anything
to do with your Directory section?  Exactly what URL are you
trying to access and exactly what message do you get?

This does not sound like anything to do with any bug in
Apache.

 What do you do with people who don't understand english?
 
 I still can't figure out what he thinks this has to do with a Directory
 section either.  Sigh.
