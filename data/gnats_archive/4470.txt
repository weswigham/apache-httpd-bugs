>Description:
 when a servlet is called as a SSI from jhtml page, getWriter() method of 
ServletRequest doesn't work. I found a work-around but I've
waisted a couple of hours, I think it would be a good idea to mention it
in the "README" that comes with the installation.


Right now calling getWriter() causes an exception to be thrown:

--

<!-- java.lang.IllegalStateException: Already called getOutputStream.

>How-To-Repeat:
Here is what's contained in my .jhtml file, 

<SERVLET NAME="HelloYouToo">
</SERVLET>


-----
My HelloYouToo servlet contains the following code:

----

public class HelloYouToo extends HttpServlet
{ 
  

 public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
		      HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
      
      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
      
      out.println("<center><BR><BR><BR><BR> HELLO YOU TOO! <BR><BR><BR>");
    
   }

}

>Fix:
No, but her's a work-around.

The work-around is to call:

PrintWriter outWrite = new PrintWriter(response.getOutputStream(), true);
