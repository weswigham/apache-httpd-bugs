Recently i was using apache-1.3.9 and apache-devel-1.3.9 and tried to upgrade apache-1.3.9 by apache-1.3.14-2.6.2. The manual directory in /home/httpd/html/ was replaced by a single file named poweredby.png. Due to this my earlier html pages were removed!!!

State-Changed-Why:

From your problem report, it sounds like you are using
an RPM.  If this is the case, then you need to contact
whomever put together the RPM.  We do not distribute
RPMs from this site, so we cannot know what procedure
they use to install.
If you are, in fact, using a copy of Apache downloaded
from an apache.org site, please let us know exactly
where you got it from.
Thanks for using Apache!
