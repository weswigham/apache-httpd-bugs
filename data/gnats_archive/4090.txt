uname -a: SunOS smoke 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

>Description:
This problem first cropped up in 1.3.x.   1.2.6 did not have this problem.  
If you have mod_jserv configured to bind a servlet to a file extension using:

AddHandler gsp-handler .gsp
Action     gsp-handler /servlet/gsp

the following warning appears in error_log each request for this servlet.  Note
that the warning is spurious, because the request completes successfully.

httpd: [Fri Mar 19 09:59:50 1999] [warn] [client 209.24.38.61] handler "gsp-han\
dler" not found for: /export/home/james/cachetest/htdocs/index2.gsp

...

The impact of this is that error_log fills up with unnecessary warnings, and I
don't know of a way to configure mod_jserv to avoid this.

Note that this occurs with mod_jserv 0.9.x and 1.0b. I don't think it's a problem
with mod_jserv, but rather with the warning code in http_config.c

Lines 512-515 in http_config.c is where the warning originates
>How-To-Repeat:
compile any version of mod_jserv into apache 1.3.x
bind a servlet to a file extension using AddHandler and Action directives
request a page with the bound file extension
>Fix:
my workaround:
comment out lines 512 - 515 in http_config.c

I would love to know if there is a better solution though.

thanks!
