>Environment:
Linux - Redhat 6.0 - kernel 2.2.12 - Blackdown Java 1.2-prev2
>Description:
I was unable to link extensions (like .jsp, or .jhtml, or .xml, etc)
to a servlet via the ApJServAction method.

I had to use AddHandler and Action to make it work
>How-To-Repeat:
It was very repeatable here, I had to NOT USE the ApJServAction
method and use the AddHandler and Action methods to make it work.
>Fix:
No - just the workaround - don't use ApJServAction :-/
