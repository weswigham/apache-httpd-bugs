 The Timber Solutions Manual (over 360 pages of problems) is a practical design guide for the solutions of the basic principles and advanced practice of engineering with wood (timber). This manual covers the major themes of typical timber engineering and  the more unique systems used in professional practice. It's primary purpose is to provide practical solutions to the problems found in actual engineering practice, course homework, undergraduate test preparation, and both P.E. Exam and S.E. Exam preparat ion. 
 
 This Manual (over 460 diagrams and illustrations) has been written to aid engineers, architects, students, and builders in solving problems in Timber Design Engineering. As the NCEE has copyright privileges on its tests, it is not possible to cite exact  problems for the P.E. and S.E. level examinations. However, the problems in this Manual are designed to be similar to, and at a comparable level of complexity as with those found on the National Exams.
 
 Each Chapter is generally arranged in increasing complexity-from entry level timber engineering course work problems to S.E. level exam problems. Every effort has been made to use standard methodology found in actual practice in the solution of the probl ems.
