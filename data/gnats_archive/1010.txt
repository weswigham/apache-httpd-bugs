Solaris
>Description:
If you use AddType to change the mime type associated with a file
and verify the change in your browser, the browser will not pick up
the new mime type even if it's restarted, because the last-modified
date hasn't changed on the file.  It's necessary to touch the file or
flush your browser cache to see the change.  This can be very confusing.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add a warning to the mod_mime docs.  Or, Apache could keep a history
of when each extension's mime type was changed and send a last-modified
date of at least that time for files with that extension.  But that's
probably more trouble than it's worth.
