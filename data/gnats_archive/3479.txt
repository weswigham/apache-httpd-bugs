>Environment:
Suggestion only to add FTP support to Apache
>Description:
Seeing as the Apache HTTPD currently provides a very slick architecture for handling lots of concurrent connections, access control and such.  Why not add an FTPD to it, using either a module, or branch out and remove the HTTPD specific code and add in the appropriate FTPD code.

State-Changed-Why:
That isn't really something that makes sense right now.
Not only do ftp servers do what they do best better than
Apache does, but it would require a major rework of the
Apache code to let it support that sort of thing.  While
that is a possible long term thing that could happen, there
is little likelyhood of it happening any time soon.
