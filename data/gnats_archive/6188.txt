>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional (5.00.2195)
MS VC++ 6.0sp3
>Description:
Where Apache 1.x.x on Win32 wrote its log files with CRLF terminators, 2.0a4 does not. It is as if it is unaware of being on Win32.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Apache 2.0a4 on Win32 and examine log files.
>Fix:
Should be an #ifdef somewhere to cause log files to use CRLF terminators on Win32.

State-Changed-Why:

We are aware of the issue, and the consensus says we need
a newline constant in APR, which will be added to an alpha
in the very near future.
