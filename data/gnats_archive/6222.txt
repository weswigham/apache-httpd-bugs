>Environment:
RedHat Linux 6.2, Standard RedHat 'Secure Server' release 
(built Mar 1 2000 13:37:34)
>Description:
I can't make the NameVirtualHost mechanism work with a non-alphanumeric character in the domain name (I have trouble with 'www.learning-fun.co.uk' and 'ti_demon.ip.uk.com'. These worked fine with my earlier release (1.3.9) which I compiled from the downloaded sources. (At least, 'ti_demon.ip.uk.com' did, 'www.learning-fun.co.uk' is a new domain). As a test, I set up DNS to duplicate all configuration of 'www.learning-fun.co.uk' as 'www.learningfun.co.uk' and simply deleted the '-' from the domain name in the 'ServerName' directive in httpd.conf. Accessing learningfun works, whilst accessing learning-fun doesn't. I really hope that this isn't a screw-up on my part, and that it isn't a known problem. I have checked through the database and I think my testing is sound. It seems like the sort of problem that would have been seen very quickly, however. If this is a real bug, I'd say it was quite a problem. I can get around it by setting up a separate IP alias, but if I had many such domain names to serve, this might not be practical.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to make the NameVirtualHost mechanism work with a non-alphanumeric character in the domain name, in particular, '-' and '_'.

State-Changed-Why:

For what it's worth, underbars are NOT legal in hostnames.
As for the hyphen problem, I personally don't experience it
on the numerous hyphenated domains I have.  When you say it
doesn't work, can you be more specific?  What happens?
