>Description:
Well, I don't know much about apache but my hostmaster even knows less. Thats' why I ask you here hoping that my description somehow explains the problem....
I can not download or open mpeg or avi files out of a secured folder (allow/deny or mod-rewrite). MSIE allways displays "file not found" or mediaplayer tries to open a "non existing" file. with mod_rewrite MSIE/Mediaplayer allways trys to open/download the default homepage.
With Netscape everything works fine! 
It seems like Apache does not get the referring URL when requesting a mpeg/avi file under MSIE!?
So I'm not sure if this can be fixed with .htaccess!?

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
