 I found a workaround / I think I stepped on an authentic bug
 The problem aroused with
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/
 not being suffixed as
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/index.html
 But *not* with
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/DownLoadsX
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/Trash
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/Sonrisas
 which were properly suffixed as
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/DownLoadsX/index.html
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/Trash/index.html
     http://frogadmin.yi.org/Sonrisas/index.html
 
 Actually, my documents are stored in a place whose windows name is
      D:\~Privacy\Reliable\MyStats
 aka  P:\Reliable\Mystats
 aka  Y:\
 In my autoexec.bat, I use the SUBST instructions:
 SUBST P: D:\~Privacy
 SUBST Y: D:\~Privacy\Reliable\MyStats
 
 Apache just does not like the documents to be stored in a root directory
 Faulty statements were
 DocumentRoot "Y:"
 <Directory "Y:">
 
 Everything works fine when I replace them with
 DocumentRoot "P:/Reliable/MyStats"
 <Directory "P:/Reliable/MyStats">
 
 BOTTOM LINE:
 there is a bug
 Apache does not make the suffixing if the documents are stored in a root directory
 BTW:
 Commenting out or leaving active the "DirectoryIndex" statement:
 DirectoryIndex index.html
 was of no importance with my files
 In both cases, Apache performs the suffixing with index.html
