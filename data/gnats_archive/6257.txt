Oracle version 8.1.5.1.0
PHP3 and PHP4
We're getting INTERMITMENT TNS-12154 error when trying to connect through Apache. The PHP OCILogon fails maybe one in twenty.  We've tried this with Apache1.3.9 and PHP 3 and 4, we still see the error. Interestingly, when we increase the virtual hosts to > 8, we tend to see the error more often.

The Oracle connection is fine (PHP works no problem from the CGI command line), it's only going through Apache it fails. We set the Oracle environment when Apache is started. Are file descriptors limit is set to 1024 (the max I believe for Sun 5.7).

Any help appreciated...it's stopping us go live!

Regards
Chris
