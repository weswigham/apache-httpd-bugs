SunOS bluestem1.cso.uiuc.edu 5.6 Generic_105181-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
Apache returns a "Forbidden" error on any file with the string '.cgi'
embedded in the filename. For example, files with these names
return a Forbidden error: doc.cgi.html, doc.CgI.html, .cgi.html,
doc.cgi.txt

However, these file names are served without error: cgi.html,
doc-cgi.html.

This problem noted on Apache 1.3.9 on Solaris 2.6, Apache 1.3.6 on
AIX 4.2, and Apache 1.2.4 on Solaris 2.6.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file with '.cgi' appearing anywhere in the filename (except
at the end) and try to access it.
>Fix:
Renaming the file is a workaround.

State-Changed-Why:
If you look at your configuration, you probably have something like:

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

Which tells Apache to try to execute it.  If you look in your
error log, you will probably find that CGIs are disabled in
that directory.

If you look at the mod_mime documentation, it describes how
and why a file can have multiple extensions.
