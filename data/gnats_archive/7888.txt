All UNIX systems, I have Solaris 6 as well as Linux (doesn't matter which version). 

gcc/gmake.
>Description:
When I specify "rotatelogs filename.%Y%d%m 86400 -420" (for US/Pacific timezone), it rotates log per GMT time, instead of midnight of localtime, also, the suffix of the log file is at odd with local time.

Given that the contents of access_log takes into account the local timezone very nicely, such as:

192.168.1.93 - - [19/Jun/2001:09:26:15 -0700] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2521 "-" "Mozilla/4.08 [en] (WinNT; U ;Nav)"


I would hope rotatelogs can do the same.

>How-To-Repeat:
configure rotatelogs with "rotatelogs filename.%Y%d%m 86400 -420" (or any other timezone offset except GMT), and run apache under local timezone.
>Fix:
I have tried several options and came to this very simple one.  In main(), I added a line 

putenv("TZ=GMT");

which would overwrite the host timezone, and it worked perfect with rotationtime and timezone offset, as descrbed in the man page.

I don't know how to setenv/timezone issues for other systems than UNIX, so leave it up to you to fix the conditional compile issues.
