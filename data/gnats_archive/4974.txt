HPUX B.10.20 A 9000/778
>Description:
This problem is due to the fact that shared libs on HP are .sl not .so
The fix was put into 1.3.6 (PR#2905 & PR#2968), but was somehow lost in v1.3.9

Version 1.3.6 Builds and links correctly the shared libraries: httpd, libhttpd.sl, libhttpd.ep
However, 1.3.9 drops the fix and consequently builds shared libs as .so not .sl
The file in $PREFIX/src/Configure dropped the fix of 'SHLIB_SUFFIX_NAME=sl'.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try the following on HPUX 10.20....
./configure --prefix=/homedirs/gsilverm/tools/web/apache_1.3.9 --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE
make
>Fix:
I put the line SHLIB_SUFFIX_NAME=sl back in at line numbers 1220 & 1230 in $PREFIX/src/Configure (v1.3.9)
./configure --prefix=/homedirs/gsilverm/tools/web/apache_1.3.9 --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE
make
make install

FYI
Here is the diff information

Configure is Configure with my changes
Configure.orig is v1.3.9 configure

1220d1219
<               SHLIB_SUFFIX_NAME=sl
1230d1228
<               SHLIB_SUFFIX_NAME=sl
