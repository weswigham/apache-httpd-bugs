>Description:
I get a page back on a URL that doesn't exist.

As far as I can see this problem comes only when accessing a user page. So with http://www.kvi.nl/~vgelder/default/xxx.html you get the page on http://www.kvi.nl/~vgelder/default.htm
You also get this page on http://www.kvi.nl/~vgelder/default

Accessing a 'normal'  page is OK (http://www.kvi.nl/default/xxx.html gives an error message).

State-Changed-Why:
That is completely normal and happens because you have both multiviews enabled and SSIs enabled for the given document.

 Well, I didn't expect that.
 
 My site scanner (self made program ScanWww) looped 'forever' because page
    http://xxx.kvi.nl/~vgelder/default.htm"> 
 contained the entry
    <a href="default/default.htm">
 and returned the page itself.
 
 How can I prevent this? Indexers may loop on this also ...
