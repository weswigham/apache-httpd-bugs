>Description:
Description:
Every 36 hours we get a new IP adress. 
The "NameVirtualHost" is NOT defined with an IP adress because it's a dynamical IP adress (it's defined as shown below).
We have 3 domain names to be served.

Problem:
At startup Apache makes a DNS lookup of our domain name and finds the IP adress of the internet connection (ppp0).
Everything works fine (perfect).
Provider gives us new IP adress.
Our 3 domain names get updated.
Apache only serves virual hosts for old IP adress.
>How-To-Repeat:
[/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf] 
(only a piece of it)

NameVirtualHost p23.dyndns.org

<VirtualHost server>
	ServerName server
	DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost p23.dyndns.org>
	ServerName p23.dyndns.org
	DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/p23/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost youcom.dyndns.org>
	ServerName youcom.dyndns.org
	DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/youcom/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost kentaur.dyndns.org>
	ServerName kentaur.dyndns.org
	ServerAlias kentaur.myip.org
	DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/kentaur/
</VirtualHost>
>Fix:
Can the "NameVirtualHost" have an extra setting it looks at a mask of addresses, or maybe even better a device (/dev/ppp0).
Or can it only be in virtual mode with a default server (= no definition of servername in main part of file).

say:
NameVirtualHost 130.161.33.15/255.255.0.0
NameVirtualHost /dev/ppp0
NameVirtualHost *
OnlyVirtualHosts On

 Hi,
 
 We can solve this problem by either  Name Based
 Virtual Address or IP-Based Virtual Address
 
 Name Based Virtual Address:
 By repeating  the "NameVirtualHost " directive for
 each domain names/address.
 
 
 In your httpd.conf file do the following changes:
 ..........
 ........
 NameVirtualHost server
 
 <VirtualHost server>
         ServerName server
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html
 </VirtualHost>
 
 NameVirtualHost p23.dyndns.org
 
 <VirtualHost p23.dyndns.org>
         ServerName p23.dyndns.org
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/p23/
 </VirtualHost>
 
 NameVirtualHost youcom.dyndns.org
 
 <VirtualHost youcom.dyndns.org>
         ServerName youcom.dyndns.org
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/youcom/
 </VirtualHost>
 
 NameVirtualHost  kentaur.dyndns.org
 
 <VirtualHost kentaur.dyndns.org>
         ServerName kentaur.dyndns.org
         ServerAlias kentaur.myip.org
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/kentaur/
 </VirtualHost>
 ........
 .........
 
 For more information refer the apache document: 
 http://.../manual/mod/core.html#namevirtualhost
 
 
 2. IP-Based Virtual Address:
 
 By removing the NameVirtualHost directive we make it
 as IP-Based Virtual Address:
 
 ie.,
 
 .......
 .......
 #NameVirtualHost p23.dyndns.org
 
 <VirtualHost server>
         ServerName server
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html
 </VirtualHost>
 
 <VirtualHost p23.dyndns.org>
         ServerName p23.dyndns.org
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/p23/
 </VirtualHost>
 
 <VirtualHost youcom.dyndns.org>
         ServerName youcom.dyndns.org
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/youcom/
 </VirtualHost>
 
 <VirtualHost kentaur.dyndns.org>
         ServerName kentaur.dyndns.org
         ServerAlias kentaur.myip.org
         DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/kentaur/
 </VirtualHost>
 .......
 .......
 
 
 And make sure the DNS entries for the above domain
 names. Any more clarification you needed, let us know.
