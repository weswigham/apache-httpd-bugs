>Environment:
Dynix/PTX 4.0.1 - GCC 2.7.2
>Description:
Spurious warnings about missing the declarations for strcasecmp, strncasecmp,
gettimeofday, __filbuf, and gethostbyname.  Couldn't find declarations in 
any system header files, but it appears to not make a difference.  

  mod_info.c:161: warning: implicit declaration of function `strncasecmp'
  mod_info.c:206: warning: implicit declaration of function `strcasecmp'
  mod_usertrack.c:135: warning: implicit declaration of function `gettimeofday'
  mod_negotiation.c:560: warning: implicit declaration of function `__filbuf'
  util.c:1242: warning: implicit declaration of function `gethostname'

Also:

  proxy_ftp.c: In function `proxy_ftp_handler':
  proxy_ftp.c:448: warning: passing arg 4 of `setsockopt' discards `const' from
    pointer target type
  proxy_ftp.c:568: warning: passing arg 4 of `setsockopt' discards `const' from
    pointer target type
  proxy_ftp.c:653: warning: passing arg 4 of `setsockopt' discards `const' from
    pointer target type
  proxy_util.c: In function `proxy_host2addr':
  proxy_util.c:691: warning: passing arg 1 of `gethostbyname' discards `const'
    from pointer target type

Also get the following warnings:

  ld: warning: Reference to `inet_network` resolved by libinet.so, but
    libinet.so not explicitly named on command line.
  ld: warning: Reference to `gethostbyname` resolved by libinet.so, but
    libinet.so not explicitly named on command line.
  ld: warning: Reference to `inet_ntoa` resolved by libinet.so, but libinet.so
    not explicitly named on command line.
  ld: warning: Reference to `gethostname` resolved by libinet.so, but
    libinet.so not explicitly named on command line.
  ld: warning: Reference to `gethostbyaddr` resolved by libinet.so, but
    libinet.so not explicitly named on command line.
  ld: warning: Reference to `inet_addr` resolved by libinet.so, but libinet.so
    not explicitly named on command line.

Etc.

No big deal, it'd just be nice to get it to compile cleanly.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Provide declarations in conf.h?  Right now GuessOS is calling Dynix "SVR4", not
Dynix in particular

State-Changed-Why:
Not going to happen for 1.2, suspending for future
release.

State-Changed-Why:
Without access to the platform there's no sense us trying to support
it.  If folks want to use it on dynix then they'll send us patches.
