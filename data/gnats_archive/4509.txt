>Environment:
Apache/1.3.6 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.3.0 OpenSSL/0.9.3 ApacheJServ/1.0b5
on both linux 2.2.9 and 2.0.36
>Description:
When posting data to a servlet and omitting the content-type header in the http request, 
the parameters are not transmitted to the servlet
( HttpServlet.request.getParameters() returns an empty Enumeration ).

It used to work with jserv 0.9.12 but does not work with either jserv1.0bx, x>=3
 
>How-To-Repeat:
simply send the following request to the server, and a dummy servlet won't
get any paramter through the service method :

POST /bin/Dummy HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: my agent
Host: 192.168.0.3
Content-Length: 26

param1=allo&param2=coucou


but just add the following header to the request
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

and it will work.

the test servlet : http://www.ruault.com/bug/Dummy.java
the client used to send the request : http://www.ruault.com/bug/bug.java

Please read the HTML 4.0 spec at www.w3.org. It requires this header to be present.
