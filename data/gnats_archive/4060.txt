>Description:
In mod_alias.html#redirecttemp, there is written:

This directive makes the client know that the Redirect is only temporary 
(status 302). Exactly equivalent to Redirect temporary. 
                                                 ^^^^^
But the correct version is:

This directive makes the client know that the Redirect is only temporary 
(status 302). Exactly equivalent to Redirect temp.

If you use temporary instead of temp you'll get something like that:

Syntax error on line 496 of /usr/local/apache/conf/access.conf:
Redirect to non-URL

>Fix:
Delete the characters "orary" in the appropriate file at the appropriate
position. :-)
