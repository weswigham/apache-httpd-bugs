>Description:
The page should display either good morning/afternoon/evening depending on the time.  The same code works fine on other web server platforms but we have chosen to migrate to Apache on NetWare.

The asp page produces the result and also strange header information as follows:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK ContentType: text/HTML Cache-control: Private Set-Cookie:N2S19P61=1070940381; path=/; Good morning! 
The Time is Now 8 : 31 

We would like to lose this header.
