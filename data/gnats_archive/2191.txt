>Description:
the directive:
LoadModule proxy_module
fails.
on the same computer on windows NT this directive does not fail
with the same httpd.conf and same binaries.

I compiled under NT.
(from some reason I could not compile under 95)

in the debugger the LoadLibraryEx call failed.



>How-To-Repeat:
add 
LoadModule proxy_module ...
to httpd.conf and run under 95
>Fix:
nope

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, we are aware of this.  PR#1462 is already open on this
and will be used to track the issue.

We currently have no idea why it fails.
