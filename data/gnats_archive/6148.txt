>Environment:
WinNT 4.0 SP5
JVM 1.2.2_0.0.5
HotSpot Java Server VM 2.0
Apache JServ 1.1.1
>Description:
If in "jserv.properties" the "wrapper.classpath" does not contain a class, which is required in a servlet, apache throws a 404 instead of a JServ-Error that a subclass has not been found. In addition, even if the logs (jserv.log, mod_jserv.log) have been set to debug, no hint is given that a class required by a servlet is missing.

This behaviour is not nice at all!
>How-To-Repeat:
For example, a servlet called "Servlet404" requires JavaMail and therefore imports javax.mail.*

But in wrapper.classpath, there is no path to mail.jar (but the servlet is referred).
