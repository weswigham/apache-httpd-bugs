Hi,I am not sure where to post this problem that bother me quite a
while,I tried the bug report page in www.apache.org but seems my problem
isnt belong to any category of it.
but after I search some bug report in bugs.apache.org and find this one
PR 1142,well,I think my problem is kinda associated with this.and here
it goes:
I use Sun Solaris International version 2.5.1,perl 5.004,Navigator
2.5PR2beta and apache 1.2.6 w/o any patch.
I use apache for quite a while ,no problem at all but yesterday,it
occurs.when I use perl to write a cgi program and test it.weird problem
jump out from the hell.sometimes it works well,sometimes (about 5 in 10
times),the navigator ONLY display part of the HTML page generate by cgi
program.after tried several tiems,it still like that.so,I think maybe
the problem of navigator sicne its just a beta2 version.so,I use the
Navigator 4.04,still the same !!!,then I begin to think the problem.I 'd
wrote a sockets tools via Java to act as a spy between 2 port and
display all data transfer between these 2 port.as the result,the
netscape post the form data is ok and the server call the cgi and
generate the html page is also ok,BUT,the navigator only display part of
the html file,why?I count the totally byte netscape received from
server,yes..no matter which cgi script I use,alwayse only display part
of the data.and when error occur,it ONLY dispaly     162    bytes of the
whole html file generate by cgi.ONLY 162..after try several times,I
remember that in HTTP 1.0,the Content-Length specified how many bytes
the browser should read from server as valid data.I use print "blah
blah" method in perl cgi before,but now,I change my method,I add a
output line as "Content-Length=length($html)",and it is OK!....so,why
the browser only read 162 bytes from the server?why the browser cant
know the HTML data is over via the close of socket but have to use the
Content-length though it can?

hope hear from you soon..
sorry for disturb..
vincent

p.s. this afternoon,my workmate,working with the same kind of
Solaris,navigator,apache but with mysql and PHP also meet this
problem,but he is lucky..I find the way to resolve it...
