sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1 compiled with gcc
>Description:
If I use a ProxyRemote directive:

ProxyRemote * http://159.151.248.10:8080

and if the address of the remote proxy host is not in the name server
or the /etc/hosts file, the proxy doesn't work in 1.2b10 when it use
to work.
I get the error message:
-----------------------------------------------
Proxy Error

The proxy server could not handle this request. 

Reason: Host not found 
-----------------------------------------------
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Get back to the original inet_addr test:

in apache apache_1.2b8:
in proxy_util.c in the function proxy_host2addr
the proxy ip adress test was done with inet_addr:
    {
	if ((ipaddr = inet_addr(host)) == -1)
	    return "Bad IP address";
	memcpy(addr, &ipaddr, sizeof(unsigned long));
    }

in apache apache_1.2b10:
in proxy_util.c in the function proxy_host2addr
the proxy ip adress test is now done with gethostbyaddr ! :
    {
	ipaddr = inet_addr(host);
	hp = gethostbyaddr((char *)&ipaddr, sizeof(u_long), AF_INET);
	if (hp == NULL)
	    return "Address not found";
    }%0
