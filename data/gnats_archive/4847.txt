AIX spnode5 3 4 000075824C00  
>Description:
Apache built and installed beautifully.  When I try to start it, this error
occurs:


# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
Syntax error on line 288 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Expected </Directory> but saw </Directory>
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started    

1.2.6 installed and ran fine.  I deleted the line and re-entered it, so there was no embedded weirdness.

No idea.  Help?
