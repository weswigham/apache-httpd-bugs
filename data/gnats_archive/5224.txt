>Originator:     hefe@dustcloud.com
>Release:        1.3.9
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP5/6
>Description:
Once the Apache service is started, every thing works fine.  After a bit, though, you begin to notice a few things.  The child process is consuming memory at every request, up till a certain amount, and once it gets there, after a bit the CPU use jumps to 100% and stays there.  
>How-To-Repeat:
No idea, try running a Win32 Apache 1.3.9 on a server that gets a lot of traffic, as i get about 25,000 uniques a day and its on a PIII 450.  Maybe it doesn't need to be a lot of traffic, who knows.
>Fix:
I have done everything.  Modded the .conf to high heaven, tried runnin in a console window rather then a service, everything I can think of.  Can't find a way to fix it.

State-Changed-Why:

What modules are installed?  Mod_proxy would be one very
bad player on this server (prior to the current 1.3.13-dev
version, which should be released shortly.)

What about your error log... anything interesting there?

Are you running isapi .dlls?  There was a handle leak that
is also resolved in 1.3.13-dev.


Any other clues?
