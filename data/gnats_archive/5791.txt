>Environment:
WIN NT, Binary release apache_1_3_11_win32 with ApacheModuleNTLM
>Description:
I'm using authentication e.g. auth_ntlm under win32 and tried to authenticate users within a <directory> block:

<DIRECTORY "C:/apache/htdocs">
...
AuthType NTLM 
NTLMAuth On 
NTLMAuthoritative On 
NTLMOfferBasic On 
require group WWWUsers
</Directroy>
works without problems

When using the same arguments for proxy access
<Directory ~ "proxy:http://restricted.site.com">
AuthType NTLM 
NTLMAuth On 
NTLMAuthoritative On 
NTLMOfferBasic On 
require group WWWUsers
</directory>
the user authorisation fails and the browser says "server or DNS can't be found'

access-control via IP-Address, e.g.
<Directory proxy:http://restricted.site.com>
order deny,allow
allow from 192.168.1.0
</Directory>
works with without problems
