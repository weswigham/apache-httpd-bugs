>Description:
When running a call search, the operation keeps timing out. This happens on a number of occasions, so when we are trying to run an urgent request for a murder enquiry we are unable to provide the data. We beleive that there is a problem with the connection between Hersham and where ever the database is.....

If this problem could be look at a matter of urgency I will be most grateful.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... this has absolutely nothing to do with us.  All we
do is make software, ie. the Apache web server.  How people
use it has nothing to do with us and we have no control over it.
You have to talk to the webmaster of whatever site you have problems with.
