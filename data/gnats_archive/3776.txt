>Description:
Hi,

Basically, we want to use Apache as a local server for our intranet and as a proxy, via another proxy server
to the internet. The internet proxy uses basic authentication and works fine with the CERN server, but we'd 
rather use Apache as it's got other features we want to use.

When using Apache a browser connecting to an internet site will request authentication, as it should do, the
problem is that authentication always fails. I can't give you any more information on the problem as you don't 
seem to have much in the way of debug output (the CERN server can be set to output headers etc. so you see 
what's going on e.g. Proxy-Authorize headers (are you ignoring these?)). If there's a way I can get detailed 
output I'd be interested in looking at it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up apache to use an authenticating proxy server.

e.g. Server_A ---------- Server_B (Basic Auth) ------ Internet

Server_A is set to send all external http requests on to Server_B who requests authentication
when first accessed.

>Fix:
No

 The workaround seems to be to modify proxy_http.c to force it to forward =
 =20
 Proxy-Authorization headers (it fixes for our problem).

State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: martin
State-Changed-When: Wed Apr 28 08:16:48 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
The line which ignores Proxy-Auth at this place is intentional.
We don't want to pass the auth information to any server
further down the chain (the assumption here is that it was
our own proxy authentication).

The error is the fact that we don't check if *WE* requested
and used the proxy authentication, or if it was another
server further down. We should only strip out the proxy
auth info if we requested and used it ourselves.

This test is indeed currently missing, and therefore
we always strip the Proxy-Auth header to be on the safe side.

It's somewhere on my TODO list...
