>Description:
IE 5.0 (Taiwan version) and Netscape * (Taiwan version) never
send "tw" for its desired web page encoding.

They use zh-tw or zh_tw instead.

Without this addition, the default page for Taiwan people,
htdocs/index.html.tw.Big5, would NEVER be accessed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use a Taiwan version IE or Netscape, access any just-installed
apache server. And try to access http://apache.kliev.net/, which
would show up the desired (big5 encoding) default page.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the problem report. I have a question though:
The syntax zh_tw is wrong (underscores aren't allowed).
Which browser does that?

 in FreeBSD, /usr/ports/chinese/netscape47-communicator.
 
 Ok, I've cc'd the chinese/netscape47-communicator maintainer for
 this information. If zh_tw is wrong, I think he'll correct it ASAP.
