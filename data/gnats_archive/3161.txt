>Environment:
linux 2.0.35, RH 4.2, gcc
>Description:
The apache proxy module first forks of a new process for the detached
garbage collection (detached_proxy_garbage_coll()) and then checks if
there is anything to do (start of help_proxy_garbage_coll()).

Result is, apache forks off twice per proxyed request, which is a major
performance leak.
