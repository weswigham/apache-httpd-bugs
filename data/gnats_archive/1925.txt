I _think_ apache was built with
ucbcc: WorkShop Compilers 4.2 30 Oct 1996 C 4.2
ld: Software Generation Utilities (SGU) SunOS/ELF (LK-2.0 (S/I) - versioning)
(although the compiler may have been upgraded since the build)

Server version "Apache/1.3b3"
Server built:  Jan  9 1998 12:27:44
Server compiled with....
 -D HTTPD_ROOT="/usr/local/apache"
 -D HAVE_MMAP
 -D USE_MMAP_FILES
 -D USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

>Description:
The CGI spec says that REMOTE_HOST should be set to the remote hosts's name, or
left undefined if this value is unavailable. This is the case when HostNameLookups
is off. However, the function add_common_vars in the util_script.c file calls
get_remote_host with the REMOTE_NAME type, which means it returns the IP address
if the hostname is unavailable. The get_remote_host call should be changed to use
REMOTE_HOST, which will make it conform to the CGI spec.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set HostNameLookups off in httpd.conf, and run some CGI scripts. Look at their
environment and compare to the CGI spec.
EG. http://cgi.www.demon.lspace.org/cgi-bin/www.demon.lspace.org/apache-cgi-bug
>Fix:
Here is a nice little patch.
