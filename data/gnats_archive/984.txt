BSDOS 2.1
>Description:
If the "LockFile" directive is not set and no "logs" dir exists in
ServerRoot then the server dies with the messages:

    open: No such file or directory
    Cannot open lock file

I request that the inaccessable file name be printed out for more clarity.
To that end, I submit the following trivial patch to "http_main.c"

*** http_main.c Sun Jun 29 13:08:37 1997

*** 268,274 ****
      if (lock_fd == -1)
      {
        perror ("open");
!       fprintf (stderr, "Cannot open lock file\n");
        exit (1);
      }
      unlink(lock_fname);

Thanks for the suggestion; that was an oversight and was
fixed in the source tree shortly after 1.2.1 was released.
