NT 4.0 SP 3, VC++ 5.0, HTTP 1.1 Client, MS DNS Server
>Description:
Server has one IP (111.22.33.44) resolves to machinename.domain, and two CNAME
records alias.domain and testvhost.domain.

Basic configuration with

   ServerName alias.domain
   DocumentRoot /webs/aliasdocs

works fine.

When adding the following directives to the configuration file

NameVirtualHost  111.22.33.44

<Virtualhost>
ServerName testvhost.domain
DocumentRoot /webs/testvhostdocs
</VirtualHost>

- all request for documents on both alias.domain and testvhost.domain now only 
fetches documents from testvhost.domain ???

State-Changed-Why:
First, what you give is not a valid VirtualHost directive.
It needs to be "Virtualhost foo" where foo is an IP or
hostname.

Second, be sure to read the vhosts section of the docs
very carefully to see how you need to use the default vhost;
in reality, you have _two_ vhosts on your server; alias
and testvhost, plus another if you want to use the
real name.

 I don't understand what you are trying to say.

 Read the docs.
 
 They say:
 
    Note: When you specify an IP address in a NameVirtualHost directive
    then requests to that IP address will only ever be served by matching
    <VirtualHost>s. The "main server" will never be served from the       
    specified IP address.
 
 and:
 
    If the lookup fails (the IP address wasn't found) the request is  
    served from the _default_ vhost if there is such a vhost for the port 
    to which the client sent the request. If there is no matching                
    _default_ vhost the request is served from the main_server.     
 
 See http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/examples.html#default for examples.
 
 There is a reason the docs are there.
