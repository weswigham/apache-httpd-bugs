>Description:
In several places, it looks like there was a failure to modify cut-and-pasted code,
viz.,

apr_status_t apr_remove_poll_socket(apr_pollfd_t *aprset, apr_socket_t *sock)
{
    FD_CLR(sock->socketdes, aprset->read);
    FD_CLR(sock->socketdes, aprset->read);
    FD_CLR(sock->socketdes, aprset->write);
    return APR_SUCCESS;
}

Shouldn't one of those "read" lines be "except"?  There are several occurrences
of this type of error in this file.
