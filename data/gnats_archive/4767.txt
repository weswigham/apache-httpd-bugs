>Environment:
Redhat 6.0, Linux 2.2.5-22, i586
apache 1.3.6 compiled with gcc egcs-2.91.66
>Description:
If you send a HEAD request to an nph-cgi, you will get the the entire output
of the script, both the HEAD and the rest of the script. Normally a HEAD would
just return everything up to the first blank line.
>How-To-Repeat:
Send a HEAD request (lynx -dump -head) for http://lucy.jbic.com/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi.
nph-test-cgi is just the stock test-cgi renamed and with the necessary HTTP
header added.
>Fix:
Stop sending data or kill the cgi once you get a blank line.
