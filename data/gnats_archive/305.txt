Solaris 2.5.1

>Description:
I have setup our top level webdocs to accessible to the world.
In attempting to give per directory access to subdirectorys 
to my subdomain with the allow/deny directives it would not work.
Here is the basic model I use:

<Directory /hyp1/web_docs/plasma>
<Limit GET>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from hyperion
</Limit>
</Directory>

When the allow directive was changed to .plk.af.mil I could
not access that directory from anywhere.  When it was changed
to .cs.unm.edu, I could access it from machines in the .cs.unm.edu
subdomain and nowhere else.  When I changed it to a specific
name of a machine in my subdomain, I could access it from that
machine.  This leads me to believe  that since the machine the
server is running on is hyperion.plk.af.mil that when it does
a hostname lookup it is only returning the short name of 
hyperion therefore not showing the .plk.af.mil subdomain part
of the name and therefore not allowing access.

State-Changed-Why:
The OS isn't always returning a fully qualified hostname.

All Apache does is a gethostbyaddr(); there is no portable way for Apache
to say it wants a fully qualified domain name.  It is possible to
configure Solaris to return a fully qualified name, but exactly how you do
that could possibly involve your /etc/hosts file, your NIS setup, or
/etc/nsswitch.conf, among other things.
