Sunos 5.6
JDK 1.2
>Description:
I have already installed the apache 1.3.4 server on a sunOS 5.6 m/c about 3 mpnths and it is working great. But I also want to install 
the Jserv engine as my web site involves some database work and it is very slow. But the problem is I am unable to bring up the engine. 
The problem is when I say "make install" it is supposed to create the .so file in the apache/libexec directory but it is not. And I am struck there.
I will appreciate if u can help me with this.

 Thanking you,
