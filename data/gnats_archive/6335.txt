>Description:
cache is disabled => proxy should cancel download if client cancels
but it completes ALL downloads.
Relevant part of the config file:

NoCache *
CacheForceCompletion 100  <-- this one shouldn't even be required but
doesn't help anyway


>How-To-Repeat:
just config like this
start a big download and cancel it
netstat -t -p -v will show you a apache-ssl task
with one open connection and one closed.
