NT 4.0, apache 1.3.4
JServ 1.0.b2 using the 1.0.b3 ApacheJServ.jar (120k)
>Description:
Apache starts up fine, attempts to start JServ, but JServ crashes, log file on apache sais can't find JServ class, but it's in the path.  Apache httpd continues to run perfectly fine, but JServ fails.
JServ logs show that the service is attempted about 10 times before giving up.

In any case, I appreciate all the hard work you guys are doing.

Well, you probably can't.
