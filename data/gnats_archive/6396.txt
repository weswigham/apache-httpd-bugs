>Description:
We are running 20 name-based vhosts that use ProxyPass to include
an internal application into the namespace of the webserver. The application
server is mapped via "ProxyPass /  http://localhost:8001/"

All requests arrive on the application server with "Host: localhost:8001"
header. We would like to see a possibility to pass the original host
header to the application without a rewrite. As a workaround we extract
the name of the corresponding vhost from the VIA header.
