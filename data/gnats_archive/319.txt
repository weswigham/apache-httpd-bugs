>Description:
I've been using Apache for many years now and recently installed
the suexec wrapper stuff. Except for a few initial problems in
the configuration things have been working well. What I want to
know is whether there are restrictions with server side includes.

For example I have a virtual set up as
<VirtualHost IPaddress>
DocumentRoot blabla.co.nz
ServerName blabla.co.nz
TransferLog logs/blabla.access_log
User blabla
Group user
</VirtualHost>

CGI's I have written work fine in this environment but the following
doesn't work
   <!--#exec cmd="ls -lt" -->
while it does work in areas not bounded by suexec.

Why?

State-Changed-Why:
The suexec-bounded environment is very restricted, for
obvious reasons.  One of the restrictions is a severely
limited PATH envariable.  The PATH is set to
"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin".  However, I should think
that your ls(1) command should be found somewhere in
there.  What does the error log contain regarding the
#exec cmd request?

State-Changed-Why:
Please give 1.2b9 a try, you can find it in the usual places.
(It hasn't been announced yet.)  Several errors in this area
were fixed.
