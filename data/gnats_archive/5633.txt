     [Klaus Johannes Rusch <KlausRusch@atmedia.net>] PR#4734

As far as I can tell from the documentation and reading the source
there is no way around this.  I use mod_rewrite to redirect to
Muhammad A Muquit's Count.cgi.  Our users are using the delimiter
character '|' which is escaped to %7c by mod_rewrite starting
with apache version 1.3.11.  
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I suggest a flag in mod_rewrite that prevents the escaping of characters,
but the default should escape.
