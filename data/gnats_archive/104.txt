>Description:
I want to use apache as proxy server using SOCKS4. I compiled it and
all HTTP requests go through fine !! But FTP requests fail.. The errorlog
says proxy: error setting PASV debug option
-setsockopt: Operation not permitted.
This occurs in line 545 of proxy_ftp.c.
My SOCKS configuration files and library don't have any problem as
I can use rftp and rtelnet well.
>How-To-Repeat:
I think it is easily repeatable.
>Fix:
Probably this module is not written for SOCKS4. Why I suspect this is
that you are not using Rbind or Rgetsocknam
