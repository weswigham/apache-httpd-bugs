State-Changed-When: Mon Jul 27 22:49:07 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Misfiled PR; _PLEASE_ do not needlessly change the subject
in responses!
>Unformatted:
I found an FTP site which I believe exhibits this problem:

ftp://ftp.diamondmm.com

is a URL for which Apache can establish a connection, but then hangs and
times-out.
