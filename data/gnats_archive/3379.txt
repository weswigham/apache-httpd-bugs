>Description:
I can't compile Apache. This is the message that I got:

===> src/os/unix
        gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DAIX=43 -U__STR__ -DAIX_BIND_PROCESSOR -DUSE_HSREGEX `../../apaci` os.c
In file included from os-aix-dso.c:92,
                 from os.c:20:
/usr/include/ldfcn.h:47: #error -qlonglong must be used
make: The error code from the last command is 1.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Yes. Just re-configure it this way:

	CFLAGS=_LONG_LONG; configure

The ldfcn.h file needs this definition to be included.
After that Apache compiles and runs well.
