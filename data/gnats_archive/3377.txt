>Description:
.htaccess files seem to require an AuthType directive even if only IP authentication is set.  This was not the case with Apache 1.2.x and should at least be documented if it is not a bug.
>How-To-Repeat:
The second of the two following .htaccess files works, the first doesn't...

<limit GET>
allow from all
satisfy any
</limit>



<limit GET>
allow from all
satisfy any
AuthType Basic
</limit>

State-Changed-Why:
Why are you putting a "satisfy any" in there?  That explicitly
says that _either_ host based access controls or user
based authentication will allow the requst.

Whta do you mean by "doesn't work" when you don't have the
AuthType?  Are there any errors in the error log, or does it
just allow all connections?
