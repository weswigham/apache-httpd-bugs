>Description:
I first noticed this problem within a VirtualHost, and though it was limited
to the VirtualHost. The problem arises when one uses numbers as directory names.
(e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 ) Or any set of numbers in [0-9].* . This will generate a status 400
or "Bad Request" from the client to the server, instead of the expected "Not Found"
error. Examples : 
		http://www2.awl.com/234234234234
will generate a status 400 
		http://www.mathsurf.com/234234234324
will generate a status 400 :
Tue Mar 24 11:00:19 1998] Invalid URI in request GET /234234234 HTTP/1.0

		http:/www.mathsurf.com/234232324/index.html
will generate a status 200 message serving the page even though the /234232324
is totally invalid. Log file: 
lepton.awl.com - - [24/Mar/1998:10:50:43 -0500] "GET /234234234/images/3_5books.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 6668 "http://www.mathsurf.com/234234234/index.html" "Mozilla/3.01Gold (X11; I; SunOS 5.6 sun4u)" 0

Notes. 
	This only happens with strings that are a set of numbers of any length 
I tested this rigourously (hopeing to find an overflow :) Needless to say I didnt find
and overflow. 
	A vanilla installation of apache_1.2.4 apache_1.2.5 apache_1.2.6 with no
virtual hosts, no rewriteing on ... etc. shows the expected behaviour when the server
is queried for "http://somehost.somedomain.com/234234234234" (a file not found).
Though when my configuration is applied (using rewriting, virtual hosts..etc) the 
wierd behaviour comes back. One may say that it is my configuration, but to argue that
point I am not doing anything strange enough to elicit this type of problem. 
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www2.awl.com/234234234234234234234234/corp/ (note you dont have to type the numbers 
exactly any set of [0-9].* will work.

 If it only happens with your configuration then it is a configuration
 problem.  And we won't be able to do a thing about it until you can find
 what part of your config actually causes it to happen.  You'll need to try
 bits and pieces of your config until you can cause it to happen.  I'm
 guessing when you do that you'll find a config mistake.  I'd start with
 the rewrite rules.

 I have already verified that it is not the rewrite rules (I am sorry I
 should have written that) I did this turning rewriting off, after doing
 that the same problem exists. More importantly while rewriting was turned
 on with debugging the URI that is passed to the rewrite engine is not what
 was requested (the /23423423423/index.html , is being translated to
 /index.html ) so the /23423423423 is being stripped away. I think this is
 wrong. Though that could be related to my lack of understanding of the
 underlying design. The main point here being the fact that it isnt the
 rewrite rules since the example mentioned above isnt getting rewritten,
 and since I have turned it off and the problem persisted. 
 	In anycase I think you are right about the configuration,though
 it isnt the rewrite rules I am at a loss for what could be causing this
 type of behaviour. I will get a config together that recreates the
 problem, and post it .. 
 
 thanks

 mod_mhtml.c was the problem. This is a module for translation of metahtml
 files. It was gobling up the digits passed within the URI. My quick
 hack cheks to see what byte we are on when processing the req->uri if
 it is < 5 (which would be 3 digits ) then it just returns the req->uri 
 'as is', otherwise it goes through the rest of the module. I dont know 
 if I have the liberty to post this module, but I will find out. If you
 close the report, I will just mail it to you dean. 
 
 This is totally unsupported , I know, but if anyone else is using this
 module this will hopefully save them some time. Since it will produce
 unperdictable results on sites that use numbers as directories. 
 
 Thanks again for all your help, and sorry if I wasted anyone's time,
 namely yours Dean :) 
 
 later,
 aaron
