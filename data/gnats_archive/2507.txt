Slackware Linux, Kernel 2.0.34
>Description:
Here is the basic problem, if you attempt to kill the server daemon by killing
it's PIDs(killall -p apachectl) and then try to start the server once again(apachectl start) apache v1.3 reports the following:
bash# ./apachectl start
usage: /usr/local/apache/sbin/httpd (start|stop|restart|fullstatus|status|graceful|help)

start      - start httpd
stop       - stop httpd
restart    - restart httpd if running by sending a SIGHUP or start if
             not running
fullstatus - dump a full status screen; requires lynx and mod_status enabled
status     - dump a short status screen; requires lynx and mod_status enabled
graceful   - do a graceful restart by sending a SIGUSR1 or start if not running
help       - this screen

./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

and I have not been able to start the server in 1hour, it's still down... I dont want to reboot! 
>How-To-Repeat:
Kill apache via it's PID(s) and then try to start the server once again.
>Fix:
No clue... but I could kill v1.2 this way.

State-Changed-Why:
*Why* did you use killall?  As is documented in numerous
places, you should *never* use killall to try to shut
down the Apache Web server.  For example, see
<http://www.apache.org/docs/stopping.html>.  As to
what you're trying to do with killall and apachectl
together, I have no idea.

Your apachectl script seems to be damaged somehow, if you
pasted its output reliably.  The first token in the 'usage'
line should contain 'apachectl', not 'httpd'.  It looks
very much as though you've managed to cp apachectl over
the httpd server image.  Try doing a 'file httpd' to
see what you've got.  If this has happened, you're obviously
going to have to acquire or build a new httpd image
because you don't have one any more.
