Ok. make dumps out in alloc.c because STD*_FILENO are not defined. I can't
believe no-one else has had this problem, so either I'm a complete incompetent
or everyone else in the world uses gcc.

OK. Here's a patch. (edited by hand afterwards so I hope it isn't screwed :-)
I've put a bit in to check for the SunPro compiler (I don't have room for gcc
on my machine so I can't test that - but I know other Solaris users who use
gcc).

Erm... these are supposed to be defined by your OS and,
on Solaris, they are.  Does your /usr/include/unistd.h not
have them in?  Are you sure your compiler is properly installed?

The solution you suggest is just a workaround for some other
problem.

 Err, you're right they _are_ in that file. I didn't really believe it
 could have been your mistake. I'll investigate further tomorrow and
 let you know one way or another.
 
 Thanks for everything,

 Hello,
 
 	I've encountered the same problem under Solaris 2.5.1 with
 GCC 2.8.1.  Here's what happens:
 
 I use the following line to run configure:
 
 env 'LIBS=-lkrb' \
 'CFLAGS=-DKRB4 -DKRB_DEF_REALM=\\\"INS.CWRU.EDU\\\"' \
 ./configure --compat --prefix=/www/secure \
 --add-module=src/modules/kerberos/mod_auth_kerb.c
 
 and apache stops compiling at src/main/alloc.c with the following error:
 
 gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=251 -DKRB4 -DKRB_DEF_REALM=\"INS.CWRU.EDU\" `../apaci` alloc.c
 alloc.c: In function `spawn_child_core':
 alloc.c:1949: `STDOUT_FILENO' undeclared (first use in this function)
 alloc.c:1949: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
 alloc.c:1949: for each function it appears in.)
 alloc.c:1955: `STDIN_FILENO' undeclared (first use in this function)
 alloc.c:1961: `STDERR_FILENO' undeclared (first use in this function)
 *** Error code 1
 make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `alloc.o'
 Current working directory /www/build/apache_1.3.1/src/main
 
 If I run configure with the following line:
 
 env 'CFLAGS=-DKRB4 -DKRB_DEF_REALM=\\\"INS.CWRU.EDU\\\"' \
 ./configure --compat --prefix=/www/secure \
 --add-module=src/modules/kerberos/mod_auth_kerb.c
 
 it gets past alloc.c, but stops where mod_auth_kerb.c needs libkrb.a.
 
 Why would changing LIBS affect the inclusion of those variables from
 unistd.h?  My apologies if I am missing something obvious..
 
 Anothing thing I noticed is if I try to include mod_rewrite with the option
 "--enable-module=rewrite" and I have a LIBS var defined, I get the following
 when I run ./configure:
 
     o rewrite_module uses ConfigStart/End
       disabling DBM support for mod_rewrite
       (perhaps you need to add -ldbm, -lndbm or -lgdbm to EXTRA_LIBS)
 
 When I remove 'LIBS=-lkrb' it gets included and I get the following output
 from ./configure:
 
     o rewrite_module uses ConfigStart/End
       enabling DBM support for mod_rewrite
 
 I tried changing 'LIBS=-lkrb' to 'LIBS=-L/usr/ucblib:/usr/lib -lkrb -ldbm'
 but it didn't help at all.

 The problem is that, for whatever reason, you aren't including all the
 libraries that -lkrb needs.  It may need -lsocket -lnsl or something else.  
 
 The routine to check to see if a header file exists uses the extra libs
 you give, so if something is wrong with them then it won't think any of
 the header files exist.  This can be confusing because in some cases the
 final thing may still link if Apache automatically includes other
 libraries (eg. -lsocket) that aren't included at that time.

 Are you saying it can't find libkrb.a?  Then that is your problem; your
 system isn't setup so that libkrb.a can be found so the compile is
 failing.
