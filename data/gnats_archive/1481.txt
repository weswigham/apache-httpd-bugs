Well this is not really a problem, just a quick question, as I could not get through to
the Unix group.  I want to convert my unix box which has Sun Solaris 2.4 operating system
running on it into a WebServer.  I just want to know is it apache 1.2.4.tar.gz
and apache 1.2.4.tar.Z I download and how do I unzip these files within the unix environment.
Also could you tell me how much memory space is required.  I would be grateful 
if you could help me as this is very urgent.

Thank you
Anne Marie Farmer

State-Changed-Why:
We really can't answer 600000 users asking how to download
Apache.  Yes, you download one of those files.  They are
uncompressed using gzip or compress (for .gz and .Z files)
then unarchived using tar, just like every other .tar.Z
and .tar.gz file.  You need to get a basic Unix reference
book or check the man pages.
