>Description:
ProxyPass shows redirected URL when URL uses the ~ character.

eg: http://www.oz.net/~cere will break ProxyPasses hidden redirection.

>How-To-Repeat:
Easy. Setup a ProxyPass statement like ProxyPass / http://eatme.com/
then query your proxy server (called foo.com) to http://foo.com/~cere
and watch it redirect you and then show you the redirected URL in the location
bar of your browser..
>Fix:
This problem was almost fixed between version 1.2.5 and 1.3.x but not quite...

I'm sure that it will be obvious to the person that patched the last ProxyPass
problem that was similar to this; which was that for ANY URL ProxyPass would
redirect but not hide the URL

State-Changed-Why:
I think there's a bit of confusion here.  If you access something
that causes the remote server to issue a redirect then apache's proxy
won't do anything with the redirect except return it... I think you
may want to look at the ProxyPassReverse directive that's in 1.3b5.

In any event, we've made a few related changes in this area in
1.3b6-dev already.  Could you give the latest development
snapshot a try?  You can get one from:

ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs/

State-Changed-Why:
No feedback from the user, so I've tested it myself.
Apache 1.3b6-dev does _NOT_ do the redirection.
The watched redirection for the user really comes
from the remote server. And as Dean already said,
for handling this the user has to use the
ProxyPassReverse feature in addition to the ProxyPass
directive. A request like /~test was correctly
passed to my remote test server and no redirection
occured by the Apache 1.3b6-based proxy.
