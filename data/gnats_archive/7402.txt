>Environment:
linux 2.2.5-15 i686 unknown
apache_1.3.19
mod-ssl.2.8.1-1.3.19
openssl-0.9.6
>Description:
Configuration:
--------------
- DirectoryIndex is set to index.html
- SSLVerifyClient is set to optional in order to be able to use 'basic' or 'certificate' fake authentification

Facts:
------
- Using account/password and https://www.xxx.yy/ returns us the index.html page (compliant with DirectoryIndex directive)
- Same but using a certificate returns 403 FORBIDDEN error
- Same but referring index.html (https://www.xxx.yy/index.html) returns the index.html page

Control:
--------
Same http.conf file used with apache 1.3.14 / mod-ssl 2.7 works nicely. 

Seems it could be related to the "security fix release addressing a problem which could lead to a directory listing being displayed in place of an error message" ? 

I have'nt been able to trace this way as changes have'nt been source documented !

State-Changed-Why:

I am sorry, but since this is a problem specific to 
mod_ssl, and not the base apache distribution,
you will need to address it with the people who
distribute mod_ssl:  http://www.modssl.org/

Thanks for using Apache!
