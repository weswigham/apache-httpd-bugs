>Description:
I've noticed that since server-status became available, on my system
the number of possible connection slots is always shown as 4 lines
of 64, regardless of how I configure the server.

It would certainly seem to make more sense to limit the slots shown to
the max set in the config, thereby giving a visual sense of how close
to maxing out you are.

I also just noticed that apachectl fullstatus and apachectl status give
identical output on my system, and these agree with the server-status
URL. That is, they also show 256 slots, 4 lines of 64, and fullstatus
and status do not differ as explained in man apachectl, i.e. details
on current connections.

My important config details:

MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 75
StartServers 50
MaxClients 75
MaxRequestsPerChild 100000

<Location /server-status>
  SetHandler server-status
  order deny,allow
  deny from all
  allow from 199.182.37
  allow from 127.0.0.1
</Location>

I figured this was a general problem, until I searched the bug-reports,
and I saw other's output that had different numbers of connection slots
shown.  I figured Apache always showed 256, and I was going to ask for
a feature change.

You will need to let me know what IP address to allow access from.

 I suppose yes this could be confusing.  But there's a reason for it -- it
 has to do with graceful restarts.  Suppose you were to change your
 MaxClients and then do a graceful restart.  If you lower it you could
 possibly have children (gracefully exiting) numbered higher than the
 current MaxClients... so we'd need to keep some sort of history for
 MaxClients in order to figure out how much of the table to show.

 Why not just show the current status correctly, and graceful shutdowns
 separately? It seems very unfortunate to display it strangely 99% of the
 time. How often would the scenario above happen in reality?
