>Description:
I just discovered a bug in the configure script of apache 1.3.9.
At least it was a bug for me ..............

From line 1034 in the script ............

[...]

OIFS="$IFS"
IFS="$DIFS"
for var in prefix exec_prefix bindir sbindir libexecdir mandir \
           sysconfdir datadir iconsdir htdocsdir cgidir includedir \
           localstatedir runtimedir logfiledir proxycachedir \
           suexec_docroot suexec_logexec; do
    eval "val=\"\$$var\"";
***    [ X$val != X"/" ] && val=`echo $val | sed -e 's:/*$::'`
    eval "$var=\"$val\""
    #   expand value
    eval "val=\$$var"
 

[...]


I changed the line marked with ***. Before my changes it reads 

val=`echo $val | sed -e 's:/*$::'`

But I got into a problem, when one of the variables above was set to
just '/' (for me especially the suexec_docroot), but perhaps
for others too if they like to install (for what reason ever) apache
in / or set other paths to /

I change the line line shown at ***, so that the variable will keep
the '/' if it is explicit set to '/', the trailing '/' are still removed
if the are some.

If you like, please include it in future versions.

Kind regards
Matthias Lohmann
>How-To-Repeat:
Just configure with f.ex. suexec-docroot=/

 This is now fixed for Apache 1.3.10.
