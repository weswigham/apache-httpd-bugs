>Description:
Frequently receiving error 'Server Returned an Invalid Response' in Internet Explorer or 'Server returned no data' in Netscape. Problem seems to be intermittant, probably from only certain children processes. Problem only occurs when accessing pages requiring authentication. Auth is handled by AuthenDBI. I've tried changing Auth handling to AuthUserFile. Problem still occured under that configuration. This problem started when I installed 1.3.3, 1.2 didn't do this.

If neccessary I can setup a userid/password for testing. Contact me to set this up.

Please try with the current version of Apache.

Is there anything in the error log?

Does this happen when accessing plain documents, or are you
accessing a module, script, etc.?

Do you have any extra modules compiled in?

 Are you using mod_perl or not?  Your original message indicated you were,
 but it isn't here...
 
 Please try 1.3.4 with only distributed modules.  
 
 Are you absolutely sure it still happens if you use mod_auth (ie.
 AuthUserFile) for authentication?
 
 Are you sure there are no proxy servers, etc. between your clients and the
 server?

 That list was from an incorrect Configuration file.

 mod_perl is the only no-distributed module I am using.
 I am compiling 1.3.4 right now.

 Still experiencing problems after upgrading to Apache 1.3.4 and mod_perl
 1.17.

 Once again, does the same thing happen WITHOUT mod_perl compiled into the
 server.

 I am currently undergoing extensive development of this machine and cannot
 afford to run without mod_perl. I may be able to test in a few weeks.
 
 Lately, the problem has only happened first thing in the morning and then
 has been fine the rest of the day. Could it be caused by the server
 processes being idle to long? If I click reload about 5 or 6 times, the
 error message eventually goes away.

 This sounds a lot like it would be a mod_perl issue to me.

 I am no mod_perl expert, but I have certainly heard of various things like
 this happening with mod_perl in certain situations.

Comment-Added:
If you can reproduce this in a test server on a different
port without mod_perl that'd be great.

One wild guess -- try editing src/include/ap_config.h
and removing the USE_MMAP_FILES define from the OSF
section.
