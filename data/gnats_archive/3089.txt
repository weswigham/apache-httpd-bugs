The page is served via regular HTTP and not SSL.
>Description:
Take this simple CGI script:

----
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
open (F, "/full/path/to/some/page.html");
while(<F>) {
    print $_;
}
close (F);
----

It worked on Apache 1.2.5, and functions correctly when run from a unix shell.
After upgrading to Apache 1.3.1 and then 1.3.2, only the first 4071 bytes of the
file are included in the HTTP output - or exactly 4096 bytes including the
"Content-type: text/html\n\n" header.

Any idea what's going on here?

Thanks,
Jack

 Hi,
 
 This problem and another with 404's returning 403 Forbidden were solved
 when I upgraded from PHP 3.0.4 to PHP 3.0.5.
 
 Thanks,
 Jack
