Only the first octet of the IP address shows up in the log files.
Seems to happen on POST more than anything. Possible related to ProxyPass
but also show's up with just GET's.
According to the apache mailing list:
Yes, this was a mod_usertrack buffer problem.  Dean fixed it for 1.3.1

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... I have no idea what you expect us to do.  The problem
is already in the bugdb numerous times, you know that it
has already been fixed... so... erm... why submit the PR?

In any case, as you know it is already fixed so I am closing
this report.
