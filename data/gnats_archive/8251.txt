Linux lenin 2.4.2 #8 Thu Apr 12 17:53:34 BST 2001 i586 unknown (RedHat 7.0)

>Description:
If you use a directive which takes as its argument a path (e.g. ErrorLog),
and the path you specify does not exist, httpd fails silently without reporting
the error.  This only occurs inside a VirtualHost context, and only when the 
VirtualHost configurations lines are included using the Include <foldername> 
(as opposed to Include <filename>) directive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a VirtualHost section in its own file, with something like:
  ErrorLog "/not/a/path"
Put this VH snippet file in its own directory, and include its *folder* using the Include directive.
Restart httpd.  It fails to start but doesn't log any reason why.

Sorry - no :-)
