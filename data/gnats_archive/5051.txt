>Description:
I downloaded apache 1.3.6 from apache site, and tried to build it with DSO as following.

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache136 \
            --enable-module=status \
            --enable-shared=status
make

I got following error messages and couldn't make apache.
	cc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DAIX=43 -U__STR__ -DAIX_BIND_PROCESSOR -qnogenpcomp -qnousepcomp -DUSE_HSREGEX `../../apaci`  mod_status.c && mv mod_status.o mod_status.lo
	  -o mod_status.so mod_status.lo 
-o: not found
make: The error code from the last command is 1.
Stop.
make: The error code from the last command is 1.
Stop.
make: The error code from the last command is 1.
Stop.
make: The error code from the last command is 2.
Stop.
make: The error code from the last command is 2.
Stop.

It seems like configure command didn't generate "ld ..." string before -o, and make command understood -o as beginning of some command, and failed.
Please teach me how to build apache with DSO.
Best regards,
