>Description:
A possibility to restrict access to a remote proxy is often needed,
when a company has an internet firewall running (apache = one of the intranet
servers) and wants to restrict the use of this firewall.

As I understand it, apache seems only to be able to restrict access to
it's own proxy. This means any other intranet webserver [NoProxy ...]
and any remote server [ProxyRemote] are sharing the same acl definition using
the <Directory proxy:*> directive.

A possibility to define a ACL for a Remote Proxy would be nice...

Tnx for listening

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, more powerful ACLs are desirable, but I don't expect that such features will find its way into the final 1.3 version of Apache.
Currently the main goal is to conform mod_proxy to HTTP/1.1.

As a workaround you can currently use mod_rewrite to implement such an access control (see the mod_rewrite manual for details) or you can use different virtual proxy hosts which use differnt remote proxies.
