SunOS stimpy 5.7 Generic_106541-09 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10

JSDK2.0

>Description:
JServ works fine if PHP module is not loaded but only rarely if PHP module is loaded
The java process does not start
Log shows that ap_standalone and getppid() are both non-zero

[28/06/2000 14:58:31:960] (INFO) Apache-JServ 1rst  initialization: JVM will be started later 1 16656 16655
[28/06/2000 14:59:02:291] (INFO) Apache Module was cleaned-up

but java process will not start but the logic in the code is clearly 
returning without spawning the java process (1rst)

Problem is resolved with the fix below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Seems to be a race condition. A slower box with the same OS revision does not 
have any problems starting the java process with the original code.
>Fix:
Code in jserv_wrapper_unix.c shows
    if (ap_standalone && getppid()==1) {
        jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_INFO,wrapper_data->config,
                    "Apache-JServ 2nd  initialization starting JVM now: %d %d %d", ap_standalone, getpid(), getppid()); 
    }
    else {
        jserv_error(JSERV_LOG_INFO,wrapper_data->config,
                    "Apache-JServ 1rst  initialization: JVM will be started later %d %d %d", ap_standalone, getpid(), getppid()); 
        return 0;
    }
If the if statement is changed to 
    if (ap_standalone && getppid()) {
 
Then the problem goes away.
