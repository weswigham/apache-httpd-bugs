>Description:
<!--#include file="footnote.shtml" -->
resolves just fine, but
<!--#include file="/footnote.shtml" -->
does not seem to resolve correctly, or at least I have 
tried all of the places I think it would resolve to, and have
not gotten it to work yet.  I tried DOCHOME, /, relative home
for instance if I am in http://somemachine.com/~bill
should it resolve to /, to /usr/local/etc/httpd/,
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs, to ~bill/
I have not gotten any of these to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
No, it is on an internal, firewalled site
>Fix:
no.  I guess since HREF=/footnote.html as a link resolves to
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/footnote.html, I would have thought
that a SSI include of file=/footnote.html should do the same

"include file" does things relative to the filesystem, so /footnote.html
_would_ be a file in the root directory except for the fact that Apache
doesn't allow you to specify a path on an included file for security
reasons.

To specify a path as the web server would, use "include virtual" instead.

 Does that solve your problem?
