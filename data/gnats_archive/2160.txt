>Environment:
1.3b6 precompiled from apache.org, Win95OSR2, 64Megs RAM
>Description:
I setup a VirtualHost inside of httpd.conf (using the Include directive).
I then setup the directories as specified in the VirtualHost directive.
Without _any_ HTML, I launch NS3.0 and logon to 127.0.0.1 and I get an
index of the directory.  I then add:

# NOT ALLOW INDEXING
<directory c:/apache/htdocs/s10-4x4/public/>
Options -Indexes
</directory>

This does in fact result in a "forbidden" error message
in the VirtualHost root directory.  Now, when
I access 127.0.0.1/stats/, same as
c:/apache/htdocs/s10-4x4/public/stats/, I get indexing
again!  I assumed that .../public/ and _all_ directories
below it would be included in the directive.

No URLs apply.  Can replicate as specified in
"description".

None

State-Changed-Why:
We are indeed seeing a problem on Win95 where <Directory>
sections don't apply to objects below it :(  We are looking
into it, thanks for the report.
