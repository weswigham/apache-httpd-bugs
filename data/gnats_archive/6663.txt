apache
>Environment:
SunOS lists 5.8 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIi-Engine (but this problem is most likely noticable on all Unix platforms.
>Description:
When installing, make install does not set the timestamps of the files in the htdocs or icons directories, which causes these directories not to show up in a "find . -newer" search.  This makes it a pain for packaging apache in certain configurations.  It's only really a problem if you don't use the standard apache locations.
>How-To-Repeat:
make apache
touch /apache.newer
make install
find / -newer /apache.server
>Fix:
This should do the trick:

   @echo "Copying tree $(TOP)/icons/ -> $(root)$(iconsdir)/"; \
+  find $(TOP)/icons/ -exec touch {} \;
   (cd $(TOP)/icons/ && $(TAR) $(TAROPT) - *) |\
   (cd $(root)$(iconsdir)/ && $(TAR) -xf -); \
   find $(root)$(iconsdir)/ -type d -exec chmod a+rx {} \; ;\
   find $(root)$(iconsdir)/ -type f -exec chmod a+r {} \;
   @echo "<=== [data]"

you'll need to make a similar change for htdocs as well.
