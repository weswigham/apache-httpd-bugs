>Description:
If a VirtualHost section contains CustomLog with a nickname and there is no
LogFormat corresponding to this nickname within this VirtualHost section,
only the nickname gets logged, even if the nickname was previously defined
outside any VirtualHost section within the same configuration file.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I would expect any LogFormat defined outside any VirtualHost section to be
know within every VirtualHost section ;-) Either this is a bug, or it needs
to be clarified in the documentation.
