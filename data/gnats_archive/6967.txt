State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Sat Feb 24 09:54:01 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The --with-optim argument to configure has been deprecated,
in favor of the OPTIM environment variable.  The OPTIM
variable looks to me like it is being propogated to all of the
sub-projects, please let us know if this is not the case on
your platform.

Thank you for using Apache.
