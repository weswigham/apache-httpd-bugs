>Environment:
Windows 98 SE
Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
I've been working on making Apache into a true "windows" app as a workaround 
for the abysmal console support under Windows 98. I have some code that allows
ApacheCore to be loaded into a Windows (as opposed to a Console) version of the
Apache mainline. However, it needs two small alterations to ApacheCore.
I have included the patch under the suggested fix section. This patch just does two
things
- Bypasses the AllocConsole check in the code to check if running as a service,
if the program is not running under NT.
We know that under Windows 95/98 that we aren't running as a service, and by 
making this change I allow Apache to start up when there really isn't a console
- Adds two more entry points to the .def file, to allow the server to be controlled
via Windows messages in the mainline.

As these are minor modifications that should not disturb the console version of
the product in any way, I would like you to consider applying them so that I can
distribute the windows wrapper that I have written to work directly against the
Apache version of ApacheCore.dll .

I would be happy to send you the windows mainline if you are interested - just 
let me know. It's different (and I think better) than other wrappers I have seen
because it traps standard i/o directly instead of just hiding the console.

State-Changed-Why:

The key goal of Apache is 1:1 correspondence of the product
across platforms.  That means that many otherwise 'neat'
Win32 behaviors are discounted, out of hand.  However, the
forthcoming release 1.3.13 will support running Apache as
a hidden 'service' under Windows 95 and 98.

In making the service changes, your thought on testing for
WinNT prior to determining if Apache is a 'service is
a process' has been incorporated. 

Your request to export ap_start_shutdown and 
ap_start_restart has also been incorporated into 1.3.13.
This has the added benefit that dynamic reconfiguration 
modules that are dynamically loaded in apache can now
restart the server, a good thing IMHO.

Please note there are *substantial* changes to the Win32
services for NT and Win9x that may significantly affect
your wrapper application.  Good luck!
