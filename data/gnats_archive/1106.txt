>Description:
NOTE: (global) does not appear on the real configuration. It
just means that the line is not inside any of the directives
like <directory>

------------------------------------------------------------
FancyIndexing on (global)

<directory /muffa>
IndexOptions SuppressDescription
</direcory>
------------------------------------------------------------

FancyIndexing directive overrides the options from
IndexOptions directive, so that only FancyIndexing option
is set. Ok, let's add another line to configuration

------------------------------------------------------------
IndexOptions SuppressDescription (global)
------------------------------------------------------------

Still the IndexOptions are overridden.

The only way to get it to work is to remove (comment out)
the FancyIndexing directive.

I wonder why there's is FancyIndexing directive in
the first place, the same thing can be achieved using:

IndexOptions FancyIndexing (global)

right ?

I think that overlapping directives are not so good idea
after all. So I propose that FancyIndexing directive will
get removed if the speculation earlier is confirmed to be
accurate.

Ah, one more thing, is it possible that this "bug" bite
the person who wrote PR#431...


Mig (who is not low on caffeine 8-)

ps. Why this textarea on www report-form is so damn small ?
    More lines, thank you.

State-Changed-Why:
The FancyIndexing directive is kept for compatibility with
NCSA HTTPd.  As you have discovered, it is not a good idea
to mix it with the use of the IndexOptions directive.
Whichever is encountered last should be dominating.  In
other words, scrap your use of FancyIndexing and use
IndexOptions FancyIndexing instead.

I'll point this up in the documentation.  Thanks for
using Apache!
