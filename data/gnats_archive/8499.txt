>Description:
Ive hacked at my config-files to compartmentalize and hide stuff,
heres a grep of the inclusions Im doing.

[jimc@groucho conf]$ grep '^Include' *.conf
httpd.conf:Include conf/sect-global.conf
httpd.conf:Include conf/sect-main.conf
httpd.conf:Include conf/sect-vhosts.conf
sect-main.conf:Include conf/sect-modperl.conf
sect-main.conf:Include conf/sect-log.conf
sect-main.conf:Include conf/sect-dir.conf

however, mod-info show only partial Inclusions:

Current Configuration: 
conf/httpd.conf 
    ServerRoot /etc/httpd
    Include conf/sect-global.conf
    Include conf/sect-main.conf
    Include conf/sect-vhosts.conf
    <IfDefine HAVE_SSL>
    Include conf/sect-ssl.conf
    </IfDefine>

I know from the env.cgi listing above (@inc is altered by startup.pl), that 
the nested sect-modperl.conf is getting properly included, just not reported.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Doc update?  bug report with good synopsis (hopefully this one)

Docs on mod-info say it reports from files, not from running server.
The effect of DSO is somewhat unclear on the report, could be clarified
by something like;

if youre running a DSO server, some directives are not properly detected.
