Can you discribe the system that you compiled the HP binaries on?
What compiler, OS etc.
I would like to talk to HP but I don't know how you compiled apache.

State-Changed-Why:
Why are you trying to use a C++ compiler to compile a C
program?  Try using cc instead.  It compiles fine on a 10.20
system using either HPUX's cc or gcc.  What happens
if you don't mess with anything in the Configuration file?

 We only have the C++ compiler. I just wanted to check
 that you had used HP's cc compiler to compile the binaries
 before talking to HP about why the C++ compiler will not compile it.
 
 Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
There are a good number of things in the Apache source that
are legal in C but not in C++, so trying to compile Apache
with a C++ compiler is likely to be a loosing battle.  You
really need to either get HP's C compiler or just install
gcc and use it.
