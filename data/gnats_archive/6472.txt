>Release:        1.3.12
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
HP-UX 10.20 gcc 2.95
>Description:
1) browser places request to a CGI that has extended lifetime.
2) browser terminates connection (Stop or Escape is pressed)
3) the CGI doesn't get killed by Apache, and either eventually expires by 
itself, or hangs around forever, which represents a problem

This bug is identical to PR 3847 however it is found on UNIX rather than NT.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following CGI script worked great for me to reproduce the problem.
Just call the script from your browser then click the back button or stop. The
script remains running and in the error_log if you let it go you will see:

Hello from trap
Exiting with out signal from trap

#!/site/gnu/bin/perl
use CGI;
foreach $item (%SIG) {
 $SIG{$item}=\&trapped;
}

print STDERR "Hello from trap\n";
sleep 1000;
print STDERR "Exiting with out signal from trap\n";

sub trapped {
  my $sig=shift;
  print STDERR "Exitied with $sig\n";
  exit;
}
>Fix:
Did not attempt all the changes in PR 3847 but if I get the time I hope to try some of the suggestions to see if it helps.
