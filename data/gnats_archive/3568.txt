Red Hat Linux 5.2 with 2.1.131 kernel.  Also reproducable on Digital Unix 4.0d
system.
>Description:
I have a proxy server set up with the following configuration:

ProxyRequests On
CacheRoot /usr/local/apache/proxy
CacheSize 10
CacheGcInterval 4
CacheMaxExpire 24
CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
CacheDefaultExpire 1

When I try to access the following URL with netscape via the proxy server
I get an empty image:

http://www.mrmnc.com/poweredby.jpg

If I do not use the proxy server I can see the image w/o problem.  I can
reproduce this problem using a Red Hat 5.2 machine running on intel hardware
with the 1.3.3 apache server, and on a Digital Unix 4.0d machine running
the 1.2.6 apache server.  The browser is running on the same machine as the
proxy server in both of these cases.  The browser on the Digital Unix machine
is Netscape Communicator 4.5  The browser on the Linux machine is also Netscape
Communicator, and I think it is also version 4.5.
Other URLs seem to work fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at http://www.mrmnc.com/poweredby.jpg via an apache caching proxy server.

State-Changed-Why:

What exactly do you mean with 'empty image'?
Do you receive an empty response from the proxy server
or a faulty response.
Do you see any messages in your error log?
Are you using any extra/custom modules?

Can you please test if the problem occurs with
browsers other than Netscape Navigator, too?

 When I view the image in the browser I see the browser symbol for an
 image that it has not yet loaded rather than the image itself.  Reloading
 the image does not help.  There are no error messages in the log files.
 The apache server I am using is the one Red Hat ships.  I have changed the
 config files to enable proxy serving.

 I tried with hotjava an that browser seems to work.  I assume that indicates
 that the problem lies somewhere inside navigator rather than with apache.
 I am using Navigator 4.5 on both the Alpha and x86 machines.  I dont have
 a different version of navigator to test with right now.  Thanks for looking
 at this and I am sorry to have bothered you with something that does not
 seem to be your problem.

User reports that the problem appears to be in the browser,

A workaround for this Navigator/Mozilla bug exists,
but it was vetoed (see STATUS).
