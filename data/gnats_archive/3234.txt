Apache 1.33 
>Description:
I've just downloaded Apache 1.3.3 and when I'm installing the software, something goes wrong....
All the installing goes well... 
But when all the software is installed and it has created the icon for APACHE software, I want to try and run program using the icon (APACHE WEBSERVER) and when I do that, a MS-DOS box appears, but that's all....

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Oct 18 13:45:52 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Read the error log and try starting it manually from a
DOS window to see if it is giving any errors before
exiting.  Then listen to what those errors in the log
or printed out are and fix them.
