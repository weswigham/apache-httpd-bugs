AIX 4.2.1.0
IBM xlC.C 3.1.4.0  COMMITTED  C for AIX Compiler
>Description:
When compiling the '/src/main' directory, I get an error message complaining of
a library file not found "libc.a[shr.o]".  My path includes the '/usr/lib' 
directory, where libc.a is found.  I am compiling for DSO support, but did not
enable the SHARED_CORE rule per earlier pr's. Since I am compiling for DSO 
is the program looking for 'shr.o'?  If so, would you know what AIX fileset
that could be found in, because I cannot find that file on any of my systems.
I am using apaci install method and call configure with these options:
configure --prefix=/usr/local/etc/httpd --enable-module=so    
(as indicated in JServ install guide, to enable DSO support for JServ module)
Here is the output received:

I just compiled Apache on a  4.2.1 box with no errors.
So you have a broken AIX machine.  e-mail me directly
to determine which AIX filesets you are missing.
