>Environment:
I can't set my document root directory.  It takes C:/Apache/htdocs
even though I have this 'DocumentRoot C:/Apache/docs' in the
httpd.conf file and '<Directory "C:/Apache/docs">' in the access.conf
file.

State-Changed-Why:
You need to be clearer about what the problem is.  Is the
problem that your actual document root is C:/Apache/docs/,
but that the server will only see it if you set DocumentRoot
to C:/Apache/htdocs?  Or that you have to set your actual
document root to C:/Apache/htdocs/, no matter what the 
DocumentRoot setting is?  If it's the latter it's
conceivable that your httpd.conf file simply isn't being
consulted by the server at startup; try explicitly using
the -f flag to Apache.exe to force it to see it.
