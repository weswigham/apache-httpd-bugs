State-Changed-Why:
1.3a1 is an alpha snapshot of the 1.3 tree at a particular
time.  We can't update the 1.3a1 release, since it is already
released.  At some point there will be a beta release, and at that point
changes which have appeared in the 1.3 source tree between
1.3a1 and then will be available in a beta release.  The
new features in 1.3 page talks about all new features in 1.3;
sometimes they aren't yet in a released version.
