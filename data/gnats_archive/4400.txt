>Environment:
I am using Apache server 1.3.6 with JServ 1_0b4 (but problem appears also
in 1_0b3).  ApacheModuleJserv.dll has no version, but is dated 26/04/99.
I am running these under Windows NT 4.0 with JDK 1.2 (+JSDK 2.0).
>Description:
I have noted that each time I follow a servlet link (that is a URL that
runs a local servlet), about 16K of memory is allocated by the server
(Apache.exe).  This memory never seems to be freed up.  Memory usage by the
java VM appears more or less constant, the leak appears to be in the server
(but I guess it may be in the DLL?).

Following non-servlet links is not a problem, memory usage remains constant.

Note: I have not enabled server cache (no CacheRoot set).
>How-To-Repeat:
Using Apache under NT, follow a URL link to a servlet, it does not appear to matter what kind of servlet.  Watch memory usage growing using the Task Manager.  
>Fix:
Nope. I thought perhaps it was a problem in my servlets, but the memory is
being allocated by the server, not by the Java VM. Also, very simple servlets
seem to show the problem.

 The issue is that the version of the .dll that you are using is 1.0b3 and
 1.0b3 contains a known memory leak that has been fixed in 1.0b4.
 
 Unfortunately for you, there is no build of the 1.0b4 .dll because of some
 Win32 build problems with 1.0b4 that have been fixed in the in development
 1.0b5-Dev version.
 
 So, your solution is to either build the .dll yourself from the CVS source
 code or wait until 1.0b5 is released.
 
 thanks,

 OK. Thanks.
 
 FYI: I did build the .DLL from src ( eventually :) )
 [I also had to rebuild ApacheCore.dll with an extra symbol (ap_open_logs)
 exported?]
 
 The problem certainly seems to be fixed.  I did observe server memory slowly
 increasing during my tests, but at nowhere near the 16K-per-link rate seen
 with the 1.0b[34] JSERV .DLL.

 Hmm... Ok, so... We consider it fixed, Anyway I don't really like that
 10kb you get "sometimes". It should be something in Apache...
