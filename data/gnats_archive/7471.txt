NT 5 Pro SP 1
MSVC 6 SP 3
Intel C Compiler 4.5
>Description:
compilation went fine (except for the known issue with rotatelogs), the service installed fine, too. however, during startup of the service, NT reports a 'memory could not be written' error, the status of the service in the 'services' CP is displayed as stopped, but apache is in fact running. 

D:\__server__>apache -i -n __apache__ -f ./conf/httpd.conf
Installing the __apache__ service
The __apache__ service has been installed successfully.

D:\__server__>apache -k start -n __apache__
The __apache__ service is starting.
The __apache__ service has started.

D:\__server__>apache -k stop -n __apache__
The __apache__ service is not started.

The problem doesn't show up in the console mode.

State-Changed-Why:

Yes, that snapshot was broken on W2K.  The 
ChangeServiceConfig2 call was invoked with the c convention
(indirectly) instead of the API's pascal convention.

Fix committed to the tree, thanks for the report!
