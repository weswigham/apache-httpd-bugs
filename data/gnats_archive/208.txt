>Description:
Netscape still has problems with animated GIF's which have an expiration date, 
causing it to request the image at every iteration of the loop. Putting the 
expires date into the remote future doesn't help, and moving the image to 
another directory without expiration may not be a viable option. Since the 
ability to mix expiring and none-expiring documents in one directory may be 
desirable in other contexts as well, I propose adding an option "never" to 
the expires module.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The following patch will add an option never, which doesn't send 
an Expires header for the selected files, to mod_expires.c. 
Please note that 'n' as a shorthand form for 'now' won't work 
any more after the patch has been applied.

State-Changed-Why:
This would be an enhancement, and has missed the
feature-freeze date for Apache 1.2.  I'll raise it
for discussion.  The keyword "never" is not a good
choice, IMO, because it implies "never expires" (e.g.,
expiration-date=end-of-time) rather than "no
expiration date given".  Even though it collides for
the first two characters, I think "none" would be a
better choice, or perhaps "omit".

Comment-Added:
Hi, thanks for the submission, but I'm pretty sure this
does what you're trying to do without adding more code:

<Files ~ \.gif$>
ExpiresActive off
</Files>

And there's also <http://www.arctic.org/~dgaudet/patches/apache-1.2-gif89-expires-hack.patch>
which is a more automatic way around this particular problem.

Since there's a way of doing this in the current set of
configuration commands, this won't be added.

Thanks for using Apache!
