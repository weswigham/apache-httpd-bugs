>Description:
I've got one question for you.

When I use SetEnv directive in Virtual host section of
httpd.conf all environmet correctly passes to all CGI,
but invisible from .php scripts.

I've built php as apache module.

What's wrong?

Server Version: Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) PHP/4.0.0 mod_ssl/2.6.4

P.S.
  I'm sorry for my bad English.

State-Changed-Why:
That is correct, that is the way things work.  If you want PHP
to make the appropriate calls to make them visable to PHP code,
then that is a PHP issue that we can do nothing about.  Such
environment variables do _NOT_ get magically set for random modules.
