BSDI 2.1 and 3.0

>Description:
Possibly starting in Apache 1.2b2, something changed that causes connections to
be left in the FIN_WAIT_2 state (we have some customers with >4000 connections
left in this state). This did not happen in previous releases of Apache 
(at least it was not reported to us). I noticed in the code that there was
quite a bit added dealing with KEEPALIVE that may be affecting this. I do not
rule out that something may be wrong with our code that is being tickled by the
recent changes to Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
One customer who is willing to try things is Luc Croteau 
<lcroteau@ls.barrhead.ab.ca> who runs an ISP in Canada. He may be able to setup
access to his site if you desire to see the problem live.
>Fix:
We have tried changing some TCP timer values to get the connections to close more
quickly, but are looking for a better solution

State-Changed-Why:
Known problem.  Unfortunately, the solution is not equally
known.  Part of the problem is that Netscape is broken and
we can't do anything about that, but there are other issues
(with the lingering_close function) we are trying to resolve.
