>Description:
 Please try to understand that every message sent to <genesis@faith-is.com> 
 is redirected to everyone complaining. It is a mailing list not a person. 
 If you wish to complain to the person responsible for this mess address 
 your message to:
   <mailto:Ella M Turner-Spence <ella@faith-is.com>  and no one else.
 
 I am as unhappy as anyone about this, but sending your complains to the 
 people victimized by this fraud is not the answer, it only compounds the 
 problem.
 
 Bill
