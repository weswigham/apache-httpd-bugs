>Description:
The Registry Key for ServerRoot has the wrong value:

specifically
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Apache Group/Apache/1.3.19/ServerRoot"

has the initial value as follows:
"C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\"

however this initial value should not be in Windows filepath convention but should be formatted the same as in the ServerRoot directive, namely:

* forward slashes not back slashes
* no trailing slash

Thus it should be
"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache"

This seems to have been a problem with 1.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install the apache binary on a win98 machine (probably will affect NT/ME/2000 as well, but I don't know)
>Fix:
Change the default keyvalue - at least have the correct format in there!
Alternatively just make this clear as a bug in the install documentation.

 (oops) apologies, that wasn't quite the situation. Even when the ServerRoot
 key's value is changed to the apache-internal format, apache seems to ignore
 it. This could be a documentation error on the order in which Apache looks
 for the ServerRoot value.
 
 It _seems_ like you can't change the ServerRoot for Apache running as a
 service under Win98 (without recompiling...).
 
 Anyway, my bug seemed to be easy problem, easy fix.  In any case there's an
 easy-enough workaround for me(use the compiled-in serverroot path).

State-Changed-Why:

Contrary to appearences, this is near impossible to fix
by writing a forward slashed, no trailing slash path from
.msi to the registry.

This problem is resolved, however, by the fact that Win32
now accepts backslashes _nearly_ everywhere (but not in
regular expressions, since it is the escape character),
and the trailing slash of the directory root is always
eliminated at startup.

Thank you for the observation and interest in the Apache
http project.
