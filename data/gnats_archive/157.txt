>Description:
Problem reported for 1.2b2, still unresolved, fix is very simple, see below.

Redirection at the end of handle_mulit() doesn't copy headers (headers_out,
notes, etc.) from sub_req to negotiated best req, so if some handler 
(type checker) sets any header for some variant, negotiated request 
is not processed correctly. I am not sure about other fields in request.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Copy all necessary members of struct request or do real redirection
with full processing (type checker, ...)
