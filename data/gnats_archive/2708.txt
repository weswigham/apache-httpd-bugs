I reported a problem previously where you could use the 'AccessConf nul' and
'ResourceConf nul' parms. This is still a problem in 1.3.1 17Jul98

when attempting to start Apache I get:

[c:\apache]Apache.exe
[Fri Jul 24 19:15:18 1998] [error] Access to file c:/apache/nul denied by server: not a regular fil

fopen: No error

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the bug report.
The fix has been committed to CVS.
There was a problem in ap_pcfg_openfile where it was
checking for just "nul".  However, "c:\apache\nul" 
(or something like that) is an
equivalent file, and therefore, we needed to check for
a fully qualified possibilty as well.

Thanks for using Apache!
