>Environment:
Any system (Windows 95 or Windows NT).  Discovered on a Cyrix 6x86 P120+, 
20MB RAM, Windows 95 Version 4.00.950.
>Description:
Any program (whether it uses the correct headers or not) that uses direct 
screen write to output information will not write to STDOUT and therefore will 
not work as a CGI under Apache.  This is more of a reminder than a bug, because 
the only known way to fix it is to rewrite the program in a programming 
language that writes to STDOUT.  The most common programming language that 
comes to mind is Microsoft QuickBasic.  Because no data is sent to STDOUT, 
Apache will receive no data whatsoever and will respond with a 500 Server Error 
warning because no headers were sent.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any program that uses direct screen writing.
>Fix:
Rewrite programs in programming languages that send data to STDOUT.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the note, although this is not a bug and people
writing CGI programs should be well aware that CGI requires
that output be sent to stdout (and must be in the correct
format).
