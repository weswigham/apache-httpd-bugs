>Description:
During analyzing the logs of May of my Apache server I noticed our
analyzing software ANALOG showed up to 80% of corrupt lines in every logfile
from our virtual host. After heavy searching I found that Apache logged the
monthname both in the german and the english abrevation:

ts006p3.pop7a.netvision.net.il - - [01/May/1997:13:28:39 +0200] "GET /hsif01.htm
 HTTP/1.0" 200 2420 "http://www.siebert.de/" "Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.02
; Windows 95)" 193.141.187.6
ts006p3.pop7a.netvision.net.il - - [01/Mai/1997:13:28:40 +0200] "GET /hsif02.htm
 HTTP/1.0" 200 1294 "http://www.siebert.de/" "Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.02
; Windows 95)" 193.141.187.6


May is correct, but Mai is the german translation and ANALOG is confused of that !
The problem is that Apache switches between the english and german version without 
any concept. As you can see in the lines above the switch happens during running.
We have a "setenv LANG de" in our shell startup script however it should not 
affect the right logging of apache !

State-Changed-Why:
I'm suspecting some module or maybe something involving mod_include
is playing with the locale environment variables.  So that a
child starts off running correctly, but then something mucks
with the settings and it stops running correctly.

Do you always start apache with the same environment variables?
(i.e. wrap it in an "env - FOOBAR=blah httpd -d /path/to/serverrot"
sort of script)

Do any of your server side includes play with the locale settings?

 I just looked at php-2.0b12 source code and it issues
 
 setlocale(LC_ALL,""); 
 
 At the beginning of a request.  This changes the locale from the default
 "C" to "de", since you indicated that your LANG variable is set to "de". 
 So any httpd children which run a php request will end up in the de locale
 and this will affect logging. 
 
 Apache uses the strftime() function to print dates, and that is influenced
 by setlocale().  I can't think of anything that is portable that would do
 what you want. 
 
 You should be able to avoid your logging inconsistency by removing LANG=de
 from your environment.  Should you want it for CGIs you can always use the
 mod_env module to add it. 
 
 If you want to hack apache to do something specific for you then you could
 add setlocale(LC_ALL,"C") into the top of multi_log_transaction in
 mod_log_config.
 
 Unless someone else has a suggestion ...

State-Changed-When: Sun Jul  6 19:02:21 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
As Dean says, is related to PHP changing the locale.
Apache perhaps should do something about the locale itself,
but it is not acceptable to reset it all the time in case
some other module changed it because of the performance
implications.
