 Hi,
 
 You have removed the handler server-parsed associated
 with extension .html.
 This will remove the handler for .html files from all
 the paths and Virtual
 Hosts. Then, if you want to use the handler for the
 particular directory, You should add
 the directive AddHandler server-parsed .html in the
 .htaccess for that directory.
 
 For example, 
 
 /htdocs/.htaccess: 
      AddHandler server-parsed .html 
 /htdocs/examples/.htaccess: 
      RemoveHandler .html 
 
     In the sub directory /htdocs/examples, Remove
 Handler directive will remove all the 
 server-parsed handler associated with the extension
 .html for all the paths.
 So all the .html files will be treated as normal html
 file.  
 
 Since we have AddHandler directive in the .htaccess of
 htdocs directory, all 
        
 .html files will be parsed by the server in that
 directory.
 
      Similarly, you should use AddHandler in the main
 directory.Even if  you used RemoveHandler
 in the sub directory, handler will be removed only for
 that sub directory.

 visolve_apache

Subject: general/5597: [PATCH] mod_mime.c RemoveHandler
Date: Tue, 12 Sep 2000 00:12:31 -0700 (PDT)

 As described in the above mentioned PR, the RemoveHandler directive acted
 as a global remove handler from all paths and vhosts for that process.
 
 Recently RemoveEncoding and RemoveType have been added in the same broken
 fashion.
 
 The attached patch is against the latest version of mod_mime.c in the
 apache-1.3 CVS tree.
 
 Cheers,
