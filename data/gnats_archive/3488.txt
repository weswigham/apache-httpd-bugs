>Description:
We are publisher of Xbase based CGI Interpreter.

When I want send like following way, there is now way to excute interpreter.

<img src="/cgi-bin/image.prg?form1=string1&form2=string2&form3=string3 >

image.prg is program script file.

Usualy I call as next. when I don't need to pass aruguments.

<img src="/cgi-bin/aragoi.exe?image.prg >

I look your util_script.c, 
 Open script file and check "#!" first. 

But I can't change our interpreter to accept "#!" syntax since it cause compatiblity problem for Xbase syntax.

If Apache could have some new directive to connect with script extention with interperter name to excute.

This also help any interpereter .exe with script and data passing too.

IIS has this future.

Thanks
