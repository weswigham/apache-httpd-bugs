SuSE Linux 6.1 - Kernel 2.2.5
>Description:
Problem looks similar to PR no. 5705 (did not find a fix there):
Apache works fine, but when trying to start JServ 1.2 automatically I get the following error messages:
*****************************
[26/07/2000 20:14:05:770] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007

*****************************
I can start the //localhost/jserv/ servlet, the configured host works fine, but the mapped servlet engine (.../engine/0) does not, it causes an internal server error with the following log:
*****************************
asterix - - [26/Jul/2000:20:14:05 +0200] "GET /jserv/engine/0/ HTTP/1.0" 500 591
