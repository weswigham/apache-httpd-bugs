>Description:
   I'd like that my users could receive personalized pages about the error when
using the proxy modules, exactly when we does when not using it, and a page does 
not exist, the user receives a page made by the Webmaster, and configured by the
Directive ErrorDucoment XXX in httpd.conf.
   This could be also done to mod_proxy.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
    Insert some directives in httpd.conf that alow's the deamon to redirect the 
error message to another pages

State-Changed-Why:
This will have to be a post-1.2 release fix, since we're
only bugfixin' now. An obvious (and good) idea.
