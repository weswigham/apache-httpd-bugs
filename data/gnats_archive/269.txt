>Description:
An SSI such as:

 <!--#exec cmd="bin/myscript" -->

which is relative to UserDir, doesn't work because of these lines in suEXEC:

    /*
     * Check for a '/' in the command to be executed,
     * to protect against attacks.  If a '/' is
     * found, error out.  Naughty naughty crackers.
     */
    if ((strchr(cmd, '/')) != NULL ) {
        log_err("invalid command (%s)\n", cmd);
        exit(104);
    }
