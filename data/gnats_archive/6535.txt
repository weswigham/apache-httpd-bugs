>Description:
	When you fail to find 'make', complain more, rather than just continuing. I assume this is what the sanity check is catching and silently failing on, but can't tell.


[root@generator apache_1.3.12]# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache_1.3.12/ --activate-module=src/modules/jrun/libjrun.a
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.12
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
 + activated jrun module (modules/jrun/libjrun.a)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
./helpers/TestCompile: make: command not found
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Linux platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed.  The below error output from the compilation
** test will give you an idea what is failing. Note that
** Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such as gcc. 

======== Error Output for sanity check ========
============= End of Error Report =============

 Aborting!
[root@generator apache_1.3.12]# which make
/usr/bin/which: no make in (/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/root/bin)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Do some sanity testing before, like when you test for presence of gcc. Expand the earlier failed make error. Make the later sanity error more verbose and informative.
