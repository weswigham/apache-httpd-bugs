>Description:
---------------------------------
Moderately loaded intranet server behind a firewall, children regularly cease
to work, only the master httpd server remains. When dying no entry in the error
log, seemingly the master server does not recognize that has no children.
Since upgraded to 2.0.36 (stock redhat update rpm) I allways experience the
SYN flood messages in the syslog:
...
Feb  9 05:12:44 web kernel: Warning: possible SYN flood from 172.16.128.65 on 172.16.128.65:80.  Sending cookies.
Feb  9 05:14:14 web kernel: Warning: possible SYN flood from 172.16.128.65 on 172.16.128.65:80.  Sending cookies.

<snip>
Feb  9 08:01:36 web kernel: Warning: possible SYN flood from 172.16.68.60 on 172.16.128.65:80.  Sending cookies.
Feb  9 08:01:54 web PAM_pwdb[399]: (login) session opened for user vili by (uid=0)
Feb  9 08:01:54 web login[399]: LOGIN ON tty2 BY vili
Feb  9 08:01:59 web PAM_pwdb[8582]: (su) session opened for user root by vili(uid=0)
Feb  9 08:02:44 web kernel: Warning: possible SYN flood from 172.16.128.65 on 172.16.128.65:80.  Sending cookies.
...
This last four lines show the last SYN flood messages as user 'vili' logs in
to restart the server. Altough the _start_ of these messages (05:12) does not
coincide with the death of children. Meantime a htdig facility tried continually
index the site, and the last access_log entry was about 04:08 am:
...

-----------------------------------
>How-To-Repeat:
htdig sometimes causes the problem (but not allways). Unfortunately
whenever I run our scripts from command line it finishes without a
hitch. When it failed ran from cron. 
>Fix:
PR#3312's Ole Tange seems to be on the right track, maybe this all is
a form of the http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/fin_wait_2.html FIN_WAIT2
problem. On the other hand knowledgable shooud visit the tcp/ip kernel
code under what circumstances you can get the TcpAttemptFailed counter
increased. I see that the counter gets increased at the SYN flood detection,
but the numbers provided by netstat -s seems to be higher than that.

State-Changed-Why:
As we very clearly state before you submit a PR, we can NOT
try to debug wacky problems with ancient versions of
Apache.  Please upgrade to a current version.

State-Changed-Why:
Hey I'm going to close this out... this seems like a kernel
problem... and I'm hoping someone puts all the pieces together
eventually... but in the meanwhile, it doesn't help us to have
a dozen of the same report open.  If you figure out anything
new, send it our way.  Thanks.
