apache -t : Syntax OK
apache as console works fine in both case: disk C: or H:
apache as a services works with the original
 DocumentRoot "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/htdocs"

apache as a service does *not* work with
 DocumentRoot "H:/htdocs"

The only significant difference is that "C:" is local and "H:" is remote.

It does not work from either the command line (net start apache) or
or graphic interface 
 <after a while ...>
 "The service is not responding to the control function."
>How-To-Repeat:
As above
>Fix:
Run as console as do not log out (just lock the Workstation)

State-Changed-When: Fri Apr 30 09:00:57 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
To allow Apache to access remote disks, NT requires that you
enter a specific username and password in the service manager
for Apache to run as.
