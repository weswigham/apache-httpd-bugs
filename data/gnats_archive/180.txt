State-Changed-Why:
Report verified.  The problem is that Apache returns
a HTTP/1.1 header even to HTTP/1.0 requests.  This is a 
valid thing to do and is necessary.  We will contact
Lycos and ask them to fix their client.  

A temporary workaround is to add:

	BrowserMatch Lycos_Spider force-response-1.0

to your config file and restarting httpd.  This will
force a HTTP/1.0 response to be sent.

State-Changed-Why:
Verified with a Spider Engineer (cool title) at Lycos that
they were running an old version of their spider for the
new URL submission page; the one they use for their main
indexing works ok, and the add a page one should hopefully
have been updated by now as well.
