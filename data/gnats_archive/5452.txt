>Description:
- Follow the mod_ssl instructions for building Apache + mod_ssl.

- Follow the DSO instructions (using apxs) to add mod_jserv to Apache.

- Try a apachectl configtest

A warning is issued that because mod_jserv was compiled without EAPI, it will
probably crash.

Workaround (for tcsh):

setenv CFLAGS -DEAPI
./configure ...
