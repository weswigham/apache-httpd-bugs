apache
>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 With Microsoft Visual C 6.0
>Description:
We were hoping to have a portable httpd.conf file, which would work no matter where people installed it, including using a relative path to the documents being served. Only absolute paths work for DocumentRoot. Is this a bug or a feature?
>How-To-Repeat:
Use a relative path in the DocumentRoot directive in the config file.
>Fix:
Adding one line works for simple sub-directories, (e.g. "script") but not for what I really want, a sibliing directory, e.g. "../script".
