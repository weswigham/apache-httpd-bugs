 Hi,
 I configured the apache webserver. I finally got it to 
 start. When I try to access the 
 demo web page or the users webpage, I get 
 the following error message:
 
 ================================
 Forbidden
 
 You don't have permission to access / on this server.
 
 
 Apache/1.3.12 Server at localhost Port 80
 
 from,
