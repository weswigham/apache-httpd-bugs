>Description:
When using htpasswd it always say
"unable to create temporary file"
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I fix the problem into htpasswd.c program with changing point:

    tempfilename = tmpnam(NULL);

to

    tempfilename = tmpnam(evitmp);

where evitmp is an array and is  L_tmpnam byte long.

man tmpnam says in HP/UX 11:

           tmpnam()       Always generates a file name using the path-prefix
                          defined as P_tmpdir in the <stdio.h> header file.
                          If s is NULL, tmpnam() leaves its result in an
                          internal static area and returns a pointer to that
                          area.  The next call to tmpnam() destroys the
                          contents of the area.  If s is not NULL, it is
                          assumed to be the address of an array of at least
                          L_tmpnam bytes, where L_tmpnam is a constant
                          defined in <stdio.h>; tmpnam() places its result
                          in that array and returns s.  For multi-thread
                          applications, if s is a NULL pointer, the
                          operation is not performed and a NULL pointer is
                          returned.

So the reason is that HP/UX 11 think that this is "multi-thread" application and need other than NULL in parameter.

State-Changed-Why:
As of the next release after 1.3.12, Apache will pass a
buffer in to tmpnam(), avoiding this problem.  Thanks!
