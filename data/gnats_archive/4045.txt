>Description:
I am developing an Apache module which uses an in-house library which is written in C++.  I want to build the module as a DSO.  I can get the module to load by using LoadFile to pull in the C++ runtime first; but the constructors on global objects (e.g., cerr) don't get invoked.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build a module in C++ and have it print messages to cerr.  If necessary, I can write you some example code.
>Fix:
Yes, I have a fix: I added two dummy C++ files to the Apache build (two so that one can call into the other and make the linker think it's being used) and linked httpd with g++ instead of gcc.  This worked fine (the module still has to
avoid using any global objects with constructors of its own, but that'll have to do).

I have put together a patch to the configuration scripts to add this fix if (and only if) configure is invoked with "--cplusplusmodules".  It picks a C++ compiler just the way it normally picks a C compiler.  It does not affect the compilation of C files.  The patch is available at <http://www.thibault.org/cplusplusmodules.tar.gz>.  The tarfile contains:

* Output of "diff -r -C3 dist patched" (where dist is the distributed source of 1.3.3, and patched is my modified version)
* patched/src/dummy.C
* patched/src/dummy.H
* patched/src/dummy2.C

(where the last 3 are the dummy C++ files used)
