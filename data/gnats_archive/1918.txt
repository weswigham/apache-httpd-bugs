>Release:        1.3b5
>Environment:
Red Hat 4.1, upgraded flex to 2.5.4, installed the 3 available patchs to Apache1.3b5
Compiller is gcc.
>Description:
When doing ./Configure it goes ok down to the line:
+ doing sanity checking on compiller and options
then it gives:
gcc: @DBM_LIB@: No such file or directory
make: *** [dummy] error 1
....

Note, it had this problem before I applied the patches.
>How-To-Repeat:
Down load v1.3b5, unpack, edit Configuration as need be, do ./Configure, note problem.
Note, I am not using any thing that would use libgdbm.so, both the lines for 
mod_auth_dbm and mod_auth_db are commented out.
>Fix:
No, took a look around, found the bad lib line in Makefile.config, removed the @DBM_LIB@ from it, but that file gets recreated each time from scratch, and I do not know where the templet is for that lib line

State-Changed-Why:
That's really bizarre, nothing in our code should generate @DBM_LIB@.
We just changed a bunch of things in this area though, so it may
already be fixed.  If you could visit:

ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs/

you'll find snapshots of the current development tree.  Can you
tell me if they work for you?

Thanks

 Hi All
 
 I no longer have that problem.  What I did was to totally delete all the
 source for PHP (CVS) and Apache (download .tar.gz), and re-create my copy
 of the PHP source (CVS again), and download a new copy of Apache.
 
 Then built all as per directions (as before) and all went great.
 
 So I do not know what the problem was.  The Apache source was the exact
 same file from the same site, and the PHP cvs'ed source was only an 15min.
 newer, so was probable the same.
 
 So, if anybody else has such a problem, I would recommend getting ALL new
 source code.
 
 Thanks for your reply.
