>Environment:
SunOS 5.5.1 Generic 103640-03 September 1996 (sun4m sparc)
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
this fails:

Redirect /foo/bar mailto:mumble@foo.com

reason: add_redirect() (mod_alias.c) calls is_url() (util.c) which fails.
is_url() looks for colon, alpha chars and "//" (net_loc stuff).

i can't see anything in the standards to preclude the above behaviour.
bnf for location header field is (from rfc 1945):

Location       = "Location" ":" absoluteURI

valid absolute identifiers need not contain network location/login components
(rfc 1808).

in fact, the above works with other servers (ibm/ncsa).
>How-To-Repeat:
the redfirect directive above will fail at runtime.
>Fix:
i understand that this has the potential to become a rathole.  i don't know
what, if any, impact on performance futzing with is_url() might have.
for my purposes, the following patch (for 1.1.3) mixes the right level of
idealism and pragmatism (i suppose "telnet:" might be ok as well):

      if((u[x+1] == '/') && (u[x+2] == '/'))
          return 1;
+     else if (!(strncasecmp (&u[0], "mailto:", 7) &&
+              strncasecmp (&u[0], "news:", 5)))
+         return 1;
      else return 0;
  }

The analysis of what's happening appears to be correct.
The correct behaviour of is_url() is under discussion.

State-Changed-Why:
A fix for this has been checked in to the sources,
and should be available in the next release after
1.2b7.  The change makes is_url() compliant with the
full absoluteURI syntax defined in RFC 2068 section 3.2.
Thanx for reporting this, and for using Apache!
