>Description:
I've installed the Apache and Jserv using DSO option.
After install them I've updated the httpd.conf with the
configuration of Jserv like disabel secret key and etc.

When I try to start apache the following error message is showed:
apachectl start: httpd could not be started

The error_log is:
7:32:01 1999] [crit] (2)No such file or directory: 
Apache JServ encountered a fatal error; 
check your ApJServLogFile for details if none are present in this file.  Exiting

The mod_jserv.log is:
[28/05/1999 17:32:01:318] (ERROR) an error returned initializing protocol "wrapper"
[28/05/1999 17:32:01:320] (ERROR) in init all protocols "wrapper" returned an error

this is a configuration issue and not a bug report. without more information we cannot help you. also, this is an issue that should be discussed on the java apache users mailing lists and not in the bug database. http://java.apache.org/main/mail.html
