SunOS 4
system libraries
gcc-2.7.2.2
>Description:
On SunOS 4, a system without strerror in its provided libraries, both
apache-1.3.0 and php-3.0 supply a replacement function named strerror.
At link time for httpd, ld complains about a multiple definition and
aborts.

I won't venture to say if it is an apache or a php problem.  It's rather
a question of convention and synchronisation between the two projects.
(I will make a similar report to the other php project.)

I use php as a static module.  (There are worst problems on SunOS in
trying to use it as a shared module.  I mention this to avoid an "have
you tried this", but of course it is not an apache problem.)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
3 possibilities:

. one or both projects define their replacement function with a prefix
  that is exclusive to them

. apache configuration detects that php3 is used as a static module
  and provides its own strerr, and so apache does not define
  NEED_STRERR, even when strerror is not provided by the os

. similarly, php does not provide a strerror if it detects that apache
  will provide one

Keep us informed about what PHP says about this. I think
there might be other similar cases. Another option would
be to, after running configure on PHP, edit config.h
so that HAVE_STRERROR is defined as 1 (I know, ugly :) :) )

 I really think the only proper solution in this case is for us to use
 ap_strerror, and then either define it or compile it depending on the
 system.

 Yes, this is the proper solution. My only area of "concern" was avoiding
 any more such conflicts and doing these "all at one go". The best,
 general fix is to have Apache just use ap_ functions totally and
 just #define them when Apache provided ones aren't needed. That's
 why I wanted to wait to see what Rasmus et.al. decided because
 ideally all this should be provided by Apache to all modules.
 
 Of course, even with all this, PHP should use the Apache version
 if it's being built as a module and it's own if not. So the problem
 still exists, somewhat, no matter how we fix it on this end.

State-Changed-Why:

As of PHP 3.0.3, PHP will no longer create its own
strerror() function if it is being compiled as an
Apache module.

As of PHP 3.0.3, PHP will no longer use it's own strerror
function if (1) it's an Apache module and (2) Apache
provides it's version. The "generic" problem could still
exist though.

 That's great but it doesn't fix the real problem of Apache defining
 standard functions with names that may conflict with other programs...
