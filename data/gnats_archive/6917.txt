>Description:
Im working on a module for Apache for Windows NT and, while
trying to have the job done, I discovered a (little) bug in the
source file util_win32.c.

Bug description:
I couldn't get any error code while apache refused to start itself
up, being unable to load my module.
The module itself loads up another DLL. This load is not performed via the
LoadLibrary Windows API function, but using the __declspec(dllimport)
feature, linking the module against the .lib the comes out after the
building of the (second) DLL.

Bug discover and trapped !
The problem is in the function ap_os_dso_error(). It simply lacks
of the inizialization of the variable "len".

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
So, where I read:
   
    nErrorCode = GetLastError();
    len = ap_snprintf(errstr, sizeof(errstr) - len, "(%d) ", nErrorCode);

I'll read:

    nErrorCode = GetLastError();
    len = 0;
    len = ap_snprintf(errstr, sizeof(errstr) - len, "(%d) ", nErrorCode);

In this way the error is correctly displayed.
