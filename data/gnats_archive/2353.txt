Dean,

1. starting with MP-RAS 2.2 all NCR Unix Systems using the same Operating 
System BASE OS Software.

2. I noticed the Problem only on the latest MP-RAS Release 3.02  (this is 
the Y2K certified)

3. Cause every Customer should upgrade to 3.02 ist should not lead to 
Problems

4. We are differentiate the Hardware platform by using either the  'uname 
-m' or the  /usr/sbin/machinetype command. since there are many options to 
this command i attached the output of machinetype -k for your information.

Product="NCR Globalyst S40 Model 3438"
Model=3438
Class=3438
Level=LEVEL4
Processors=2
CPUid=0
CPU="Pentium"
Speed=100
CPUid=1
CPU="Pentium"
Speed=100
Boot=0
Dump=SUSDUMP
RBIOS=NO
EISA_PCI_Bus=yes

5. If you think i should modify GuessOS and implement machinetype please 
let me know.


regards

Klaus

GuessOS returns i486-ncr-sysv4 on all NCR systems running under SVR4.

I'd like to apply your patch, but I'm confused.  It seems that you're
changing behaviour for all NCR SVR4 systems rather than just the MPRAS
system that you say has the problem.  Maybe you could improve GuessOS to
return more information if you need it to distinguish between different
NCR systems?

Or, does the problem exist in all NCR systems?

Thanks
Dean
