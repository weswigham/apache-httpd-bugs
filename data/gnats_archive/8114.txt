>Environment:
Windows NT 4 SP6A, Apache Win32 binaries
>Description:
When my ISAPI dll is in directory with restricted access (by mod_auth), it can't see Auth string. I use Borland Delphi 5.0 to compile DLL and Authorization property of TWebRequest to see Auth string; on IIS it works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make New->Application->ISAPI Application project in Delphi.
Setup default handler to return Request.Authorization.
Place .htaccess file in directory with dll. This file must include such strings:
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "restricted area"
   AuthUserFile "<way to my user file>"
   Require user <some valid user>
   Options ExecCGI
In httpd.conf AllowOverride in the root directory section must be All.
Connect to server, try execute dll in restricted directory, type valid username and password in window. You'll see empty page.

 My problem solved when i added SECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION define to
 the util_script.c module.
 I think that it may be useful to add such switch to the config file.
 Anyway, there is another problem with environment variables, ISAPI and
 Delphi. (Delphi loses the last character of the variable value). See my bug
 report #8242 about way to solve it.

State-Changed-Why:

As the user points out, there is a compile flag to alter
this very dangerous behavior when needed.  Folks compiling
win32 isapi's can likely build the server themselves with
this flag set.  It's STRONGLY discouraged, so the current
behavior is correct.

thanks for the report and interest in the Apache project
(and your other report is still flagged to be fixed.)
