AIX 4.2.4
uname -a
AIX kbkaix 2 4 00100190E800
>Description:
Fails to process and require access information as set forth in .htaccess file. Seams to ignore the .htaccess file completely. I have verified annd conf files  are correct by running them on Linux box. Works correctly on Linux however AIX just ignore the access information. Same  htdoc files work correctly with AIX using Apache 1.2.5 release.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install 1.30 or 1.3.1 on AIX and try to use .htaccess for valid user.
>Fix:
No idea. The mod_access is being compiled and linked. No idea why the file is being ignored.

You need to set an AllowOverride directive for that
directory that includes what you want to set.
