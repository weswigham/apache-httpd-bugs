Linux, JDK 1.1.2
>Description:
Cocoon appears to talk to jserv at localhost, but remote servlets need
to connect to an ethernet IP.   With ApacheJServ 1.0 this was not a
problem since the server listened on all IPs, but with the bindaddress
parameter in 1.1b3 it would seem that only one address can be configured
for listening.    This MIGHT be a documentation problem if bindaddress
can be used to make it listen on all addresses because I did not see
how to do it.
>How-To-Repeat:
  Server A-----Server B----Client

  configure A to provide servlets to server B and also run Cocoon on A
>Fix:
Enhance the handling of 'bindaddress' to allow multiple IPs (or all IPs)
If this is already available, then perhaps the documentation needs some
clarification
