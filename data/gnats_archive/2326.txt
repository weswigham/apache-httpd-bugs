>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 sp3
>Description:
If I combine all .conf files into httpd.conf and put the following statements in httpd.conf
# allow all 3 config files to reside in httpd.conf
AccessConfig /dev/null
ResourceConfig /dev/null
 or 
AccessConfig nul
ResourceConfig nul

I get the following type of errors:
[c:\apache]apache -S
[Sun May 31 10:59:18 1998] [error] Access to file c:/apache/nul denied by server: not a regular file

fopen: No error
httpd: could not open document config file c:/apache/nul

[c:\apache]apache -S
fopen: No such file or directory
httpd: could not open document config file /dev/null

Under 1.3b6 redirecting to nul worked fine

State-Changed-When: Tue Jun  2 13:16:31 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Under 1.3b8/1.3.0, Apache will now allow for the 'nul'
"device file" when under Win32. For this to work, it
must be simply nul (although NT accepts fulls paths for
nul, Apache will only allow nul)
