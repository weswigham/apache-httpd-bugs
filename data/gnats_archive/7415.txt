It generates the following output even if I gave any command to the "#exec cmd" directive.

>Fix:
I couldn't found the real cause of this problem.
But I found some problem in util_script.c,
function: ap_call_exec
line:1127

pCommand = ap_pstrcat(r->pool, "\"", comspec, "\" /C \"", 
 r->filename, "\"", NULL);
//1. The value of "r->filename" is HTMLfile name, not command name?

for (p = pCommand; *p; ++p) {
 if (*p == '/')
 *p = '\\';
}
//2. this code change "/C" to "\C".
