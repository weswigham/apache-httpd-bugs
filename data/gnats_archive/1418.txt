>Description:
In most of my projects I use the Apache webserver because it is the best
there is. Unfortunately I stumbles upon the following problem when investigating
writing a CGI program that will process all files ending in a certain extensions
(e.g. to make a server-side programming langauge like PHP or Cold Fusion).

There is a security problem when an action is installed to let a CGI program
process all files ending in a certain extension, e.g.:
  AddHandler prhtml-action prhtml
  Action prhtml-action /cgi-bin/process.cgi

When access to the URL
http://host.com/secure/file.prhtml
is secured by a password (because the directory "/secure" is), it is still
possible to get at the file _without_ giving the proper credentials by
accessing the URL
http://host.com/cgi-bin/process.cgi/secure/file.prhtml
when the directory "/cgi-bin" is not protected by a password.

Thanks, Vincent.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Intall a handler by adding the following lines to httpd.conf:
     AddHandler prhtml-action prhtml
     Action prhtml-action /cgi-bin/process.cgi
2) Write a CGI program called process.cgi that displays the environment
   and prints the file passed in PATH_TRANSLATED, and place this CGI
   program in /cgi-bin.
3) Make a directory "/secure" and place an .htaccess-file in it that
   prohibits all access (deny from all)
4) Put a file called "file.prhtml" in that directory.
5) Access the URI "/secure/file.prhtml". This should give a "permission
   denied" error.
6) Access the URI "/cgi-bin/process.cgi/secure/file.prhtml". This will
   give you the contents of "/secure/file.prhtml".
>Fix:
The module "mod_actions" seems to use an internal_redirect to implements
actions like these. Maybe a subrequest could be made with a special flag
that prevents access-checking. That way the directory "/cgi-bin" could
be secured without harming access to a file like "/notsecure/file.prhtml".

Apache is behaving correctly, the /cgi-bin URL is not

another ScriptAlias which is protected.

Thanks for using Apache!

 You should be able to have your script check the appropriate environment
 variables to verify that it is not being called directly.  You would have
 to look at them and examine the differences to see if this is workable
 though; haven't looked.

 Hi Marc and Dean,
 
 Thank you for replying, it's interaction like this that makes Apache such a
 great server to use.
 
 Dean is correct; Apache is behaving correctly. The problem I faced was the
 fact that is always possible for a user to access a secured file by directly
 accessing the URL starting with "/cgi-bin/process.cgi". However, protecting
 the /cgi-bin directory would also disallow access to "/notsecure/file.prhtml",
 so that is too severe a solution.
 
 But, the hint Marc gives is a good one; the environment variables REQUEST_URI,
 REDIRECT_URL, REDIRECT_STATUS and sometimes REDIRECT_QUERY_STRING are
 different when the cgi program is called directly. As I will be developing the
 process.cgi myself I can make use of these.
 
 Maybe it's a good idea to add this question to the FAQ list. When I posted a
 question about this problem in comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix, I got no
 useful reply, but I did get an email from someone asking me if I had gotten an
 answer yet. The only thing is; it's very difficult to explain this problem
 clearly. :-)
 
 Regards, Vincent.
