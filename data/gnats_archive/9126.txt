>Description:
My upload speeds are terrible. When I do an Online speed test here http://64.13.111.3/support/online_tools/speedtool_high.asp I get an average upload speed of 367 Kbps, but when people connect to my webserver and download my major file of 154Mb the download speed starts in the high 100's Kbps and drops to around 30 to 40 Kbps within 1 minute. Is this some kind of setting I need to change in Apache? Any info on this would be great! Thanks for your time!

State-Changed-Why:
It is almost certain this issue has nothing to do with Apache.  Apache sends data as quickly as the network lets it.  It has no way to send data any faster, so there is really nothing we can do to help you.

Make sure you aren't getting confused between kilobits per second and kilobytes per second.  Most browsers report kilobytes per second, multiply by 8 to get kilobits.

Cable modems really aren't designed to support high upstream speeds.
