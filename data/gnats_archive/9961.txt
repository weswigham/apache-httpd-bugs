>Description:
I have been using Apache 2.0.28 for some time now on Windows XP and it's been great.  I wanted to upgrade to Apache 2.0.32 and upon doing so, at the completion of the install,  I open the Apache Monitor and there is no Apache service listed, when I open the services control panel there is no Apache service listed there either.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have been able to repeat this so far on 1 machine only (that's all I've tried so far) but will try more soon.
>Fix:
Not as yet
