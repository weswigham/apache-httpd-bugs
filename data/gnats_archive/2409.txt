>Description:
This is strange, Using Apache 1.2.4 and I have in my .htaccess file, among
other things:

ErrorDocument 401 /Errors/AuthorizationRequired.html
ErrorDocument 403 /Errors/Forbidden.html
ErrorDocument 404 /Errors/FileNotFound.html
ErrorDocument 500 /Errors/InternalServer.html

The strange part is, 401,403,404 come up correct as the custom error
message, however 500 still comes up as the default!  I even tried stuff
like:

      ErrorDocument 500 "test

and that didn't work either!  Any ideas?
>How-To-Repeat:
ErrorDocument 500 "this doesn't work
>Fix:
Allow customizable 500 error messages.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm unable to reproduce this problem with the
current version of Apache.
Please upgrade to Apache 1.3.0.

And please do not submit a bug report and post to usenet
at the same time. Read and follow the instructions on
http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html before you submit
a bug report.

State-Changed-Why:
Re-open the PR...
I'm able to reproduce the problem. Example: We have a .htaccess
file with an error in it and an other .htaccess file in a
parent directory with "ErrorDocument 500 /whatever".
If an access to the the sub-directory triggers a status 500
response Apache won't use the custom error document defined
in the .htaccess, but the standard error message (or a
custom message defined in the server configuration).
Other directives in the parent .htaccess file are 
not ignored, just the ErrorDocument directive...

State-Changed-Why:

The problem lies in http_request.c (rev 1.130) starting at
line 459.  The directory tree is completely walked to parse
.htaccess files before the module configs are merged; since
the syntax error causes the parse to fail, the error doesn't
get a chance to be handled by any per-directory settings,
but defaults to the server settings instead.  I'm looking
into this.

 If a parent directory has a customized forbidden htaccess directive, and a
 later directory is chmod 700, the customized error message is not
 displayed and the standard one is used.
 
 chmod 700 - ErrorDocument error messages ignored, standard error message
             used (incorrect)
 chmod 755 - ErrorDocument error messages used (correct)

State-Changed-Why:

A fix to the .htaccess merging sequence has been committed.
It should appear in the next release after 1.3.3, and
will correctly handle ErrorDocument 500 occurrences in
superiour .htaccess files and <Directory> containers.
Thanks for the report and for using Apache!

[submitter say second problem isn't a problem after all]
