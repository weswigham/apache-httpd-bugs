>Environment:
SunOS alanya.m.isar.de 5.6 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc
GCC 2.8.1
>Description:
The documentation does not describe how a module containing several
files is added. Example: PHP/FI 2.0b12 needs mod_php.c, mod_php.h,
and libphp.a. Also, it requires the addition of a long string
of options to the Makefile in src.

(Yes, I know PHP/FI is obsolescent. But It's still around, and
PHP 3 is not yet fully released.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try adding PHP/FI 2.0 to Apache 1.3b6.
>Fix:
Change documentation to tell where to do changes. E.g. copy all files
to modules/extra, then edit src/Makefile. (Or src/Makefile.in ?)

State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Sat May  2 09:15:59 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

I'm afraid we cannot document how to compile Apache
with complex modules like mod_php, because this should be
documented by the module's author(s).

The php README contains detailed installation
instructions, please read it.
