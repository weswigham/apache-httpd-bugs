>Environment:
Linux 3.0.34 / gcc v2.7.2.3 / no patches to apache
>Description:
this affects logging (and tracking & statistics that rely on httpd logs) for
dialup systems running v1.2.6 or higher with virtual hosts on a dialup link..

i previously submitted a report (PR# 2397), i would've submitted this under
that pr# but i lost the copy of that email on my system.. ;)

basically, everything works fine until my system redials it's ppp connection
and is assigned a different ip.. i'm using two hostnames via ml.org, known
to apache as two virtual hosts, plus two intranet addresses, also known to
apache as virtual hosts.. all vhosts have their own logfiles and are 
name-based virtual hosts. nowhere in the apache config files have i specified
any ips..

so after my system redials (and now has a different ip), all requests and
errors are logged to apache's main logfiles, instead of to separate logfiles
for each respective vhost as i've configured.. restarting apache takes care
of this.. i started having this problem with v1.2.6, v1.2.5/1.2.4 never had
this problem..

i guess i could just have pppd restart the server everytime the machine
redialed it's dialup, but i'd rather not do that since the ppp-on/ppp-off
scripts method seems a bit flakey to me.. ;)
>How-To-Repeat:
configure apache with a few name-based vhosts, then change the ip of the
device requests for those vhosts come in from.. all requests & errors should
go to apache's main logfiles instead of the vhosts' respective logfiles..
>Fix:
i dunno, i can't code.. ;)
maybe have a 'vhost-name'/'vhost-ip' option somewhere that would have apache
depend on hostnames only or ips only.. =)
what changed between 1.2.5 and 1.2.6 in terms of vhost logging? :)

State-Changed-When: Fri Jul 17 15:32:18 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

The virtual host code was completely rewritten for
Apache 1.3.0 and is simply not designed to work
with dynamic IPs (dial up lines) and it is unlikely that
we will change this behavior.

You may add one '_default_' vhost which responds to requests
on any interface/IP, but if you want to use multiple
vhosts you have to restart Apache when you re-connect
to your ISP.
Or you use mod_rewrite to rewrite requests based on
HTTP_HOST.
