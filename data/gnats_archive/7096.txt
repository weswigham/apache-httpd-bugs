>Description:
before a CGI under /cgi-bin/ is called, both the cgi and the directory must be set to UID/GID equal to userid/grpid. if the cgi was changed by user, there will be securerity problem. On vitual host runing php, the php was compiled by root, If the owner of php was set to root.usergrpid, and chmod 710, the php cgi can not be  changed by user to avoid securerity problem. plase check. thanks!
