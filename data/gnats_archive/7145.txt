I'm running Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8) on UltraSPARC with the latest GNU gcc, tar, make, etc.

uname -a --> SunOS rhine 5.8 Generic_108528-01 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
Standard installation of apache into /usr/local/apache, compiled from source obtained from apache.org web site. If I change /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf so that the pid file is "/usr/local/apache/logs/apache.pid" rather than "/usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid", apachectl can no longer stop or restart the web service. Can still stop/restart with a manual kill -TERM or -HUP. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Cannot be observed external to the server...
>Fix:
Just the obvious: Update apachectl to read the value of "PidFile" as set in httpd.conf

State-Changed-Why:

apachectl is just a simple shell script to help
with sending signals to Apache.  If you change
file locations after the install, you will need
to edit apachectl to inform it about the changes.
apachectl can't find the PidFile the same way
Apache does, because it would need to recreate
the entire configuration processing routine,
which is not as simple as it may look.

Thanks for the suggestion, and thanks for using
Apache!
