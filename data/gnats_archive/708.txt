>Description:
this is the .htaccess file:
AuthName Members area
AuthType Basic
AuthDBMUserFile /home/httpd/users
<Limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</Limit>

this is the DBM file:
[jeff@checker httpd]$ ls -l
total 30430
drwxrwsr-x   2 root     www          1024 Jun  9 12:15 conf
drwxrwsr-x   5 paramoun www          1024 Jun  9 12:27 htdocs

-rw-rw-r--   1 root     www         12305 Jun  9 15:20 users 

there is an entry in the access file:
[root@checker httpd]# /usr/sbin/dbmmanage.new /home/httpd/users view
mike = 19tL4VmM4Wym2
[root@checker httpd]#

This is the error log:
[Mon Jun  9 15:21:04 1997] access to /home/httpd/users failed
for me.foo.com, reason: could not open dbm auth file
[Mon Jun  9 15:21:04 1997] access to /home/httpd/htdocs//members
failed for me.foo.com, reason: DBM user mike not found

I have mod_auth_dbm compiled in, with the -lgdbm flag, 
it does not give me any grief at compile time.

This is the symbols from my httpd binary
[root@checker httpd]# nm bin/httpd | grep dbm
0806b670 T create_dbm_auth_dir_config
0807c424 D dbm_auth_cmds
0807c4b4 D dbm_auth_module
0806b820 T dbm_authenticate_basic_user
0806b950 T dbm_check_auth
         U dbm_close
         U dbm_fetch
         U dbm_open
0806b7b0 T get_dbm_grp
0806b6f0 T get_dbm_pw
0806b6a0 T set_dbm_slot

I have tried 
AuthDBMUserFile /home/httpd/users.db
in the .htaccess file.  

I have tried EVERYTHING on this.  Here is the offending code:
char *get_dbm_pw(request_rec *r, char *user, char *auth_dbmpwfile) {
    DBM *f;
    datum d, q;
    char *pw = NULL;
 
    q.dptr = user;
    q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr);
 
    if(!(f=dbm_open(auth_dbmpwfile,O_RDONLY,0664))) {
        log_reason ("could not open dbm auth file", auth_dbmpwfile, r);
        return NULL;
    }
It would be nice if I knew WHY it could not open the dbm auth file :|

>How-To-Repeat:
I am not sure how to repeat it on another machine.  I have seen quite a few
related posts, but no real solution.

State-Changed-Why:
Which db library did you link against?  Did you link against
-ldbm, -ldb, or -lgdbm?  dbmmanage unfortunately doesn't adapt
to what you've linked the server with.  You need to add "use DB_File"
or "use GDBM_File".  At least I think that's the perl magic
needed.

At any rate, dbm auth definately works... I'm typing this message
to you on a form on a 1.2 server in a dbm auth space.  The filename
is specified without the trailing .db.

Comment-Added:
[copy of mail message from original author]

I compiled the server originally with mod_auth_dbm.c instead of
mod_auth_db.c.  When you use mod_auth_dbm.c,  and -lgdbm, you need to to
add a use "use GDBM_File" in dbmmanage to create the database file, which
will have no extension, then HARD symbolic link it to databasefile .pag and
.dir to get it to work.

I solved all problems by recompiling with mod_auth_db.c , -lndbm and
leaving dbmmanage untouched.

I suggest that this entire process is explained more clearly or rethought.
I think the docs could be a little more complete in explaining the DBM GDBM
NDBM dilemna.  Also, what would REALLY help is an a little bit more
diagnosis in the error files.  The messages you get in ther server logs are
completely unhelpful.  I had no idea what the problem was.  See below for
log entry:

[Mon Jun  9 12:55:19 1997] access to /home/httpd/users failed for
xx.xx.xx.xx, reason: could not open dbm auth file

thank you,

This has been dealt with in 1.3, by replacing dbmmanage with
a script that can figure out the fileformat dynamically.
