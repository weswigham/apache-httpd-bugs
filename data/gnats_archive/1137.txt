State-Changed-Why:
Please try without the SSL patches.  It is possible that
they are changing something that is breaking things.

Also give it a try without '-v' and let me know
the error message it gives.  I'm having trouble making
sense of the error message it gave with -v.

State-Changed-Why:
User reports base distribution without SSL works
fine, so we can't really help much.

 My apologies - I've restored the original apache_1.2.0 and make has run
 without a hitch.  It doesn't solve my problem, thou, as the main reason I
 started this was to set up a secure server.

 With -v it prints out a whole sheinigan of cc command as cc sees it, plus
 time() output.  
 I suspect that the main problem lies in different EXTRA_CFLAGS setting: in
 the version of apache-ssl I have (and I suspect I grubbed kinda
 'development' version) it sets EXTRA_CFLAGS=-w3 -v -g
 which means:
 -w3: no warnings, die if warning issued
 -v: print all this verbose stuff, and
 -g==-g2: no optimization, but debug information.
 It also comments out (? didn't check the original) OPTIM=-O2 so that it
 becomes
 #OPTIM=-O2
 but Configure still sticks -O2 into OPTIM, so uopt complains that it can't
 both optimize (-O2) and skip optimization for the sake of debugging (-g).  
 I'm trying it right now with cleared EXTRA_CFLAGS, and it seems to like it,
 except giving me warnings which I saw mentioned in other bug reports: 
 cfe: Warning: proxy_cache.c, line 804: illegal combination of pointer and
 integer
      p = mktemp(c->tempfile);
  ------^
 I gonna look up the solution and try again.
 Thank you very much, I should bung my dumb head on the wall some more ;-)
