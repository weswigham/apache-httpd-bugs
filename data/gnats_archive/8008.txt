>Description:
A colleague set up a directory within htdocs called PHP which contained several html & PHP files.

We got a 404 Error every time we wanted to access anything within that directory, and the Apache error log said that the browser was trying to access the file (say test.php) from c:\php\test.php. Turns out it was because the directory was called PHP. I renamed it and all was fine.

I guess it's a mix-up with the ScriptAlias in httpd.conf? Not sure if it's an Apache or a PHP problem, so I thought I'd let you both know!

Didn't find anything on this online anywhere either.

Cheers!

State-Changed-Why:
Umh... Apache has no knowledge of a directory named "PHP" built into it.  Since you give no information about what version of Apache you are using or what your configuration is (other than to refer to "the scriptalias" without saying what it is set to), there is nothing we can do to help.  This doesn't sound like a bug in apache, but rather like a configuration problem which we can't help with here.

 Well the guys at PHP seem to have figured it out with the same info you
 got??? see their answer below - it _is_ ans Apache config problem - and it
 doesn't matter what OS or version you're using - if it supports PHP the
 problem will occur.

 Old Summary: Can't have a subdir called PHP in HTDOCS
 Old Status: Open
 Status: Bogus
 Bug Type: Apache related
 Operating System: Win2000
 PHP Version: 4.0.6
 New Comment:
 
 apache configuration problem.
 
 You have aliased the /php subdirectory, that means that you will not be able
 to put files in that real directory.
 
 The same for /icons, try having a htdocs/icons/ dir, it won't work with the
 default installation...
 
 This is not a bug, but a apache-configuration issue. There's no problem when
 you use the isapi module, but you can also rename the /php script alias to
 something wierd, like JBSDLJKJVBDS.
