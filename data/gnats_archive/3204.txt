>Environment:
Downloaded Binary version of 1.3.3 win32 on WinNT 4.0 sr3
>Description:
If I create a subdirectory anywhere in the document tree, the server will not display
it as a directory listing. If I put the location in the URL the server does display
the contents.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a subdirectory "header" under the htdocs directory. Remove the 
index.html file from the htdocs directory and display the directory contents. The "header"
directory will not be displayed. If you add the "header" directory in the URL i.e.
http://localhost/headers/, then the content will be displayed.

State-Changed-Why:

You don't happen to have "HEADER*" listed in an IndexIgnore
directive, do you?  As is provided by default?  That's
what's probably causing this.

[response from submitter]
That's it. Thanks. Before I sent in the bug report I created a "header"
directory on my UNIX Apache and that worked ok. I just tried it with
"HEADER" (all caps) and it did not show. Since WinNT is not case sensitive,
neither will show up on WinNT. Very subtle.

Keep up the amazing work,

Michael Shannon
