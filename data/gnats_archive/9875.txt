>Release:        2.0.32
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows XP Professional, using the 2.0.32 no-ssi MSI install.
>Description:
After installing the MSI package, the apache service monitor appears in the system tray, but it can't locate any services. I opened the services MMC and there wasn't an Apache service listed there. I tried to manually run the EXE and start Apache.exe using the '-k start' flag and it told me that no service labeled Apache2 could be located. My guess is it's creating everything but not adding the service. The INSTALL.TXT file says: "The .msi package configures the httpd.conf file, and installs and starts the Apache2 service for you." Maybe it's just something someone forgot to build into the MSI on this latest beta release. You may have gotten several reports of this already, but i couldn't find any in the database.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install the MSI package. Check and see if the service is successfully installed.
>Fix:
Maybe check the Windows Installer script you're using to build the MSI in Installshield for Windows Installer (or however you're building that) and see if it's installing the proper service in the Setup Components area.

State-Changed-Why:
Dup of bug report PR 9863... We hope to have a new installer
for testing sometime over this weekend.  ITMT, change to
the c:\program files\apache group\apache2 folder, and the
command;

bin\apache -k install -n apache2

should fix things.

Thanks for trying the 2.0.32 BETA!
