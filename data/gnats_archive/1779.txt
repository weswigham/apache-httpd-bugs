>Environment:
OS=SunOS butthead 5.5.1 Generic_103640-14 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
Compiler=gcc
>Description:
Did a default build, changing compiler to gcc.  Also had to modify the Makefile
after Configure was run to include -ldl and -lintl at the end of LIBS1 (after
-lpthread).  Compilation went without any problem, but execution is giving the
message:

ld.so.1: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: symbol not found: _thr_main: referenced in /usr/lib/libpthread.so.1

I used nm and found the symbol in that library.  This is my first undertaking of
Apache on Solaris.  Other OS installations (using Apache 1.2*) have all been
no-brainers.
>How-To-Repeat:
GCC with Solaris 2.5.1 should do it.
>Fix:
None

State-Changed-Why:
We'll be removing USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT from solaris
which should solve this problem.  This will happen in 1.3b6.
