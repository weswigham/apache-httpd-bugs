 Dear Support,
 
 I am using Apache HTTP Server 1.3.6 with Apache Jserv 1.0 for an =
 Internet based email system.  My system is written with Java 1.1.7 and =
 Java 1.2, which is heavily relied on lots of session values.  I used =
 lots of codes to remember different clients' status, which are similar =
 to the following:
 
     session.putValue(".....", ".....");=20
     session.getValue(".....");
    =20
     [In average I have 50-300 session values per request ]
 
 However, I found that some session values would "mess up" when I have =
 more and more session requests.  Eventually, all the displayed =
 information would scope up as result of the incorrect session values.  =
 For example, I put down a set of session value for A, and another set of =
 session values for B [those session values include their browser info, =
 their unique ID and their password].  Initially, there is nothing wrong, =
 client A and client B can only see their information.  However, when =
 more and more clients log on to the system, client A may see client B =
 information rather than his information.  If I restart the Apache, then =
 everything would back to normal.
 
 It seem to me, it is an internal bug in the Apache Jserv engine.  The =
 session values are somehow reused without
 some consistence checking in Apache/Jserv.  Do you have any suggestion =
 for me to eliminate the problem?  I notice the Jserv 1.1.1 is just =
 released, do you think if I upgrade to the new version would help?  =
 Besides,  may I know if the bug is fixed in the new version, does it =
 have any limitation on the number (or size) of session values?  How long =
 would it clean up / refresh those session values? =20
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 
 Regards,
 
 Anita Chan ^ ^
