>Environment:
AIX 4.2.1, gcc.2.95.1, PHP-3.0.12
>Description:
If I made Apache with default options it worked fine.
But when I did

./configure --prefix=/work/wwwspr
cd ../PHP-3.0.12
./configure --with-apache=../APACHE_1.3.9
make 
make install
cd -
./configure --prefix=/work/wwwspr --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a
make
make install
/work/wwwspr/bin/apachectl start

I din't see any error, httpd started (I controled that by 'ps -ef|grep ht'),
but there wasn't any answer from Apache. 
For example - when I send 'tn localhost 80' a conection is established but immediately ended (it don't wait for other requests).
I can't see any errors, /work/wwwspr/logs/error_log is O.K. too.

State-Changed-Why:
If it works fine until you add PHP, then I would really suggest
that you need to talk to the PHP guys about it.  It is
quite likely that it is something relating to PHP causing
the problem and, even if it is something that is Apache's fault,
they are the ones who can debug it.
