Win NT 4.0, service pack 3.
>Description:
The following CGI script on Windows doesn't produce output
until the 47th line is generated.


#!/usr/local/bin/perl       or  #!c:/Perl/bin/perl.exe

local ($oldbar) = $|;
$cfh = select (STDOUT);
$| = 1;

print "Content-type: text/plain", "\n\n";

for ( $i = 0; $i <1000; $i++ ) {  printf(
"%04d---------------------------------------------------------------
-------------\n", $i );  sleep 1; }


The above script works fine on Unix. Updates are generated every second.
To rule out perl as a possible cause of troubles I also tried to use regular foo.bat aproach:

@echo Content-type: text/plain

dir
rem c:\Cygnus\B19\H-i386-cygwin32\bin\sleep.exe 10
c:\ntreskit\sleep.exe 10
dir

The Windows results are consistent (assuming dir produces ~20 lines). 
There is no update until the end of the second dir.

State-Changed-Why:
As I said in response to your Usenet post, this is a known
issue related to the fact that Win23 doesn't support various
operations currently needed to do this in the same way that
it is done on Unix.

There is already another PR (1623) on this, and it will be
tracked under that one.

 Of course all writes aren't nonblocking!
 
 A nonblocking write is where the write will return with a specific error
 if it would block instead of completing right away.
 
 There really isn't anything useful you can do by knowing that, since if
 you could fix the problem you would probably already know what a
 nonblocking write is...
