I am trying to use ProxyPass to provide external access to our internal
web server. However, I also want to protect it with a .htpasswd file, which
resides in the /Ntra directory. When loading any files underneath /Ntra,
apache properly requires a password for access.

However, when loading the /Ntra/intranet/, access is granted without a
password.

Here is the directive from my httpd.conf file:

ProxyPass /Ntra/intranet/ http://<internal webserver>.heurikon.com/

If this is the intended behaviour, then I would request that this be mentioned
in the ProxyPass section of the mod_proxy docs.

thanks!

Also I noticed that the links are not properly rewritten if any of the trailing
/'s are omitted from the directive. For example, if the directive is this:

ProxyPass /Ntra/intranet http://<internal webserver>.heurikon.com

Then the links do not work after the root html file under /Ntra/intranet



>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a ProxyPass directive with a .htaccess and .htpasswd file in the parent
directory to try and limit access.
>Fix:
Either change the behaviour of ProxyPass to check for .ht files before allowing
access (this would be my preferred solution) or simply mention in the docs that
these files do not affect access to the ProxyPass directory.

State-Changed-Why:
ProxyPass controls URLs, and has no relation to the
underlying filesystem.  Use the <Location> directive
to protect URLs.

Thanks for using Apache!
