>Description:
In the howto document there is a description on how to redirect an entire site to a single cgi program with this line:
ScriptAlias / /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/redirect_script

This doesn't work on Apache 1.3.3 and it didn't work on apache 1.2.6. The correct answer is to add a / at the end of the line:
ScriptAlias / /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/redirect_script/
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/howto.html
>Fix:
Insert a / at the end of the ScriptAlias line...
