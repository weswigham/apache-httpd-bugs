>Description:
When Apache runs in standalone mode, it leaves file descriptors 0, 1 and 2
open. I noticed this problem when I was testing a script which stops and starts
apache from cron. cron keeps waiting on a pipe (to get the output from the
command) which is kept open because apache keeps these file descriptors open.
I verified this with lsof(1).

I think daemon processes should always close fd's 0, 1 and 2.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use fstat, lsof or a similar program.
>Fix:
Add close(0); close(1); close(2); to the detach() function in http_main.c

State-Changed-Why:
This is on The List as part of an error logging cleanup.  Apache
will close all of those once it detaches, but first we have to clean
up various fprintfs and printfs.  Thanks for the reminder.
