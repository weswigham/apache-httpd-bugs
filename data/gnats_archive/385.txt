>Environment:
Apache 1.2b8, Any OS
>Description:
In order to keep compact (and easy to read) files comment could be held in
the configuration lines, as follows:

Port            80                          #; Must be root if < 1024
HostnameLookups On                          #; On/Off. Log names/IP addresses
User            nouser                      #; Name or Id
Group           nogroup                     #; Name or Id
#BrowserMatch   Mozilla/2 nokeepalive

By this way comment would be:

    Any line starting by # at column 1

    Any characters after the #; sequence

The double character allows both # and ; to be part of non-comment field
in any config line

There are some changes to be done to util.c

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for your patch. It is too late for changes to the 1.2 release, which is now in a "feature freeze". It will be considered for future releases.However, the sample configuration files include long and extensivecomments on all directives -- more than could fitonto a single line with the directive as well. Productionsites can easily remove the extra comments if they want,or reduce them to a single line before the directive.

State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 20 17:47:50 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately this change is incompatible with the current syntax
of apache's config files.  In particular, modules can ask for "raw"
arguments, which can include #.  There's no easy way for the core
to break the comment out without breaking existing config files.

Thanks
