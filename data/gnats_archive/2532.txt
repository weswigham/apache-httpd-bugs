>Description:
I'm trying to set about converting our servers from Netscape to Apache(which
would be a tremendous boon for me). In the process, I keep running across 
server's whose CGI scripts cause Apache to hang(there seems to be no problem
on the Netscape servers).
The last one we ran into hung while trying to parse lines of a flat file that
looked like:
blah ||ted|steve|bob|etc
The perl in the CGI was to go through and replace the pipes with alternate
characters. If you remove the space traling the initial word, the CGI runs fine.
(eg. blah||ted|steve|bob|etc)
Any ideas as to why?

State-Changed-Why:
The bug report page clearly says 'no CGI questions.'
There's not much we can do without seeing the actual
script in question.  If you will forward it to me
(without Ccing apbugs) I will take a look at it.

 The line of code that the server hung on(and what's odd is that it
 doesn't hang ALL the time... only sometimes... which is beginning to irk
 me, as I can find little common denominator)...
 
 Reading in a file in perl... when it gets to
 
 $line =~ s/\|\|/<\/td><td>/g;
 
 
 It hangs reading this data:
 
 Tennessee ||8/7/98||7:30 PM||A,B,E
 
 
 Now... if we comment out the line, the script dies normally. If we
 remove the space ater the word Tennessee, the script runs fine, and the
 server doesn't hang ever. If we leave the space in, the server hangs
 SOMEtimes.... (phase of the moon?)
 
 Now... it doesn't seem to have this problem on the Netscape Commerce 2.0
 server, or Enterprise 3... I have not tried Apache 1.2.6 yet.. but its
 inconsistency seemed to strike me as odd.
 
 Any ideas?

Comment-Added:

What happens if you try running this script interactively
(rather than through CGI) with a "-w" added to the
shebang line?  I'm wondering if there may be something
that Perl doesn't like - but not enough to complain.

Are there any errors in the error log relating to this?
Do you have a ScriptLog set up?  You might try setting
one up and having this script exit with a non-zero
status to force any Perl messages into the script log..

 Appears to be a specifically Solaris 2.4 bug. Replicated the bug on
 several different Solaris 2.4 machines (varying patch levels from most
 up to date to rather unpatched).
 
 Solved the problem by upgrading to Solaris 2.5.1
