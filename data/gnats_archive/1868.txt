>Description:
I had great difficulty finding the documentation of the syntax of the
regular expressions.  I eventually found some hints to the syntax in the
RewriteRule section of the web site and in the source tree I found regex.7.

Since so many rules allow regular expresssions, it would be very helpful
if there one section giving the full syntax.  Examples would also 
be good for those who are not familiar with regular expressions.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Take the regex hints from the RewriteRule section and make it a separate
page.  Expand it to be more complete and add some examples.  Change all
the the mentions of regex to be links to this page

State-Changed-Why:
thanks - we added a note to the FAQ about it.  That FAQ
should probably be linked to from every mention of regexp's
in the docs, I agree.
