Linux (redhat 6.0), kernel 2.2.12 SMP (x2), egcs 1.1.2
>Description:
HTTPD runs perfectly until 8-10 in the morning when INFOSEEK searches for /robots.txt
on one of my virtual hosts. I have no error-document, and the log files from apache says:

SIGHUP received, attempting to restart...
then.....
Broken Pipe (client socket), Error 32   (about 70 pcs.)

The silly thing is, I haven't send the SIGHUP. Does apache do that itself ?
httpd doesn't restart, and I have to do it. A apachestl start won't do...

ariel.globecom.net:8080/error.html
>Fix:
No, but Apache 1.3.6 works fine with same configure-options and httpd.conf.
