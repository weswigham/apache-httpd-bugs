>Description:
# ./configure.org --enable-rule=SOCKS4

makes such results as:

Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.9
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
configure:Error: No such rule named 'SOCKS4'
>How-To-Repeat:
Use OS with "tr" which requires square brackets to specify a range, such as System V.

The patch below worked on both SunOS 5.5.1 and SunOS 4.1.4:
