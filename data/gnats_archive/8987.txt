 You aren't really using apache 1.3.2, are you?  What version of Apache?
 I am guessing .12, .20 or .22.  Please assure you are running the 
 latest -n- greatest on Win32, since a number of errors are closed in
 Win32 with every successive release.

 <P>Sorry.&nbsp; Should have been more precise.&nbsp; I'm running 1.3.20.</P>
 <P>I'll try upgrading to 1.3.22 and see if that helps.&nbsp; You think the problem is with the http server and not mod_webapp?<BR>__________________________________________________________ </P></DIV>
