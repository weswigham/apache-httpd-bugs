>Organization:
>Environment:
Window NT, Apache 1.3.6, MSVC++ (but using the binaries of Apache)
>Description:
We have installed Apache on a Window NT Workstation to be used on our local network. It is started as a service.
On the same machine we user Netscape communicator 4.51 connect to the internet for surfing and downloading e-mails.

The problem we are having is that Communicator hangs (i.e. does not seem to 
get any connection to the internet). When we stop the Apache Webserver, the
Communicator is running just fine.

We tried to use IE40 for surfing, and it works fine also when Apache is running.
>How-To-Repeat:
I hope so.
>Fix:
None, beside stopping apache when we are surfing ...

State-Changed-Why:

Please upgrade Apache and NT to a recent service pack, since
Apache has undergone many bugfixes and improvements, and
certain NT service pack levels are known to have buggy
TCP/IP stacks.
