looks like this belongs attached to some other PR...
too bad the subject line wasn't set right so it's not

	People use inetd when they put apache up on a machine along
	with a page that says, you really ought not be here, go away.
	In that senario it's totally reasonable to launch it from
	inetd.

	We have problems removing entries already in the config file
	since then various automations and GUI editors break down.
	That triggers complaining from particularly clueless users
	who we can't help until the down stream applications get
	repaired.  Ah - the wealth of a legacy.

Thank you, Ben, for your thoughtful explanation.  Your explanation expands 
the one in the online docs.

Since I didn't respond with the full Subject in my previous email,
I reprint my former reply below:

Ben,

        My deepest apologies for wasting your time.

I found the explanation regarding ServerType's in the online docs in the
following manner:

goto file:/www/apache/htdocs/manual/index.html

click on Starting in the TOCs

takes one to: file:/www/apache/htdocs/manual/invoking.html

click on ServerType

takes one to: file:/www/apache/htdocs/manual/mod/core.html#servertype

where there is a brief explanation on the differences between inetd and
standalone.

        Once again, my sincere apologies,

                Philip
