Thank you very much for this encouraging answer. 
According to your statement all netscape users should wait
until netscape is pleased to fix this bug. And in the meanwhile
the great Jserv programmers do nothing because they are following
the HTML specs. This is great !!

Ok ! This was the first and the last time i send a bug report to the
jserv community.
