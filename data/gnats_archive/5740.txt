Host Operating System : FreeBSD 3.2-RELEASE (x86)

>Description:
I recently installed the new Apache/1.3.11 with JServ/1.1 and mod_ssl/2.50.
Before i did
this installation, the machine was running an Apache/1.3.9 with JServ/1.0,
JDK1.1.8 and JSDK2.0
without any problems. With the new versions being installed, JServ logs the
following:

[10/02/2000 10:39:00:414 CET] <info> ApacheJServ/1.1 is starting...
[10/02/2000 10:39:00:440 CET] <info> Connection authentication is disabled
[10/02/2000 10:39:00:451 CET] <info> Connection allowed from
localhost.s2m.net/127.0.0.1
[10/02/2000 10:39:00:452 CET] <info> Listening on port 8007 accepting 5
maximum
connections
[10/02/2000 10:39:00:467 CET] <info> Creating Servlet Zones

In my jserv.properties file, Jserv is configured to a maximum connection
value of 50
(which is default). The next problem is a servlet call to the method
request.getRemoteHost().
This method sometimes returns an empty value. Doing a reload in the browser
(no proxy)
with shift(ns) or ctrl (ie) pressed, the method randomly gives a result (the
correct hostname)
or just nothing without any recognizable pattern.

My operating system is FreeBSD 3.2 with a SMP-Kernel.
