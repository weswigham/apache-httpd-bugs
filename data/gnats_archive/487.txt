SunOS 4.1.4
No patches applied to the 1.2b8 release
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
This is kind of a followup on PR# 317.
The Indexes directive works for anything that doesn't get rewritten, but after
passing through a RewriteRule like the following:
	RewriteRule ^/home/([^/]*)/?(.*) /home/$1/.www/$2 [L]
if the resulting local patch doesn't contain an index.html and Options None has
been set it still produces a directory listing.
I'm not using an .htaccess files.
>How-To-Repeat:
Basically just use a RewriteRule that results in an empty directory and
have "Options none" set for the server.
>Fix:
Not at the moment..

State-Changed-Why:
There's a really good chance this was fixed in 1.2b9, if you
could give it a try when it's released in a few days that'd
be great.

Thanks

1.2b10's fixes to subrequest promotion didn't help this
problem.  I have copies of the user's config if needed.

Can you please verify that this is still a problem
with the released 1.2.1 code?

[Update from originator]

        I ended up tracking this down to a difference between url based
directory indexing restrictions versus physical path directory based
indexing restrictions. In essence this can be resolved, with just the
possibility of having better documentation describing the difference.

If you can send me a message in private mail about
the sort of clarifying notes you'd like to see added,
I'll see about getting them added.  I'm glad the
problem got worked out.

Thanks for using Apache!
