SunOS elvis 5.6 Generic_105181-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
I used to work with NCSA Web server and using htaccess, I restricted access to some directories.
I installed the Apache 1.3.1 and it is ignoring the htaccess that in the directories.

The following lines in the htaccess:

AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /product1/www/cs/.htpasswd
AuthName "Customer Support"
require valid-user

At the same directory, there is the .htpasswd file.
What is wrong with the server ?

This is not really an appropriate thing to ask here until you
have tried other channels, as suggested.  This is answered both
in the FAQ and would be answered by posting to Usenet.

Your problem is almost certainly that your AllowOverride
directive for the directory in question is not set to allow
AuthConfig settings.
