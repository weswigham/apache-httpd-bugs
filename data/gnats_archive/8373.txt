Windows 2000
>Description:
We changed from IIS 5 to Apache 1.3.20 a few weeks ago and are very happy with it. However, since then it is not possible to download any larger files. This seems only to happen, if the user has a very slow connection.

The Download just stops at about half of the file. You don't find anything in the error files, there's always status 200 shown. 

Probably it has something to do with a timeout or so, but I can't find the right configuration directive (already set the timeout to 7200).

Try it with a slow connection (the file should be about 8 MB).
>Fix:
Setting the right timeout (or whatever) directive, but didn't find it...

 This bug exists on Solaris 8 Apache 1.3.14 too.
 
 This bug is marked as Critical and has been open since Sep 2001!  Is 
 there a workaround please?  I don't want to upgrade to a later release 
 unless you can assure me this bug is fixed in a later one.
 
 Thanks
  Brian
