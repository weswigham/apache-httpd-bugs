>Description:
I have tried to install apache web server in Win2000. I was able to install it, but unable to run the server. The error is "Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly". My question is can apache run on win2000? or is that another version of apache which is only for WinNT/Win2000, after all, win2000 is still a little different from WinNT.
