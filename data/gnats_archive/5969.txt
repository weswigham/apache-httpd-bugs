>Description:
I've set up a restricted directory for some CGI scripts.  My intent is to allow GET queries without a password.  POST queries should require one.  The directory setup is as follows:

<Directory "/users/clas34/restricted/">
   AllowOverride Any
   Options ExecCGI
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
</Directory>

The .htaccess file in the restricted directory is as follows:
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/.htpasswd
AuthName "Class 34 Restricted"
<Limit POST>
Require Valid-user
</Limit>

The .htpasswd file exists and contains an entry:
class34:VsiUV2LUTsCUQ

When I try a GET that works fine.  When I try a POST the password entered is never accepted.

By the way, I expect to change the 'Allow from all' in the Directory to 'Deny from all' when everything is working, but right now I need to provide access.

 Please go back and check the docs again.  "Valid-user" is not the same as
 "valid-user".  If you looked in the error log, you would probably find
 that out.

 Erm... then no one will be able to access it, unless you have a "satisfy
 any" somewhere, but there isn't much point to doing that.  Look 
 through the docs again; host based access control and username based access
 control are two different things.
