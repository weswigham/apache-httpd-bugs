>Description:
A multitude of problems with a base server and 4 virtualhosts.
The base server is on an IP that is not associated with anything
There is a virtual host, with its own DocRoot, TransferLog, ErrorLog,
etc.  When I telnet www.crazies.com 80, and do GET /cgi-bin/monitor.pl
It runs and tells me the DocRoot of the main server. When I use
GET /cgi-bin/monitor.pl HTTP/1.0, it tells me the DocRoot of the main
server. When I use a browser, it tells me the DocRoot of the virtualhost.
It also is logging sometimes the hits of the virtualhost on the BASE access_log. Othertimes, the virtualhost is giving 404 for files it does have.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid you aren't very clear in exactly what you are
doing, and what you think is wrong and what you do and what
you expect vs. what you get.

I would guess that your virtualhosts are configured
incorrectly.  Are you trying to use non-IP based vhosts?
Do you have an IP address for each virtualhost?  Exactly
what problems are you having?

If you don't have an IP address for each vhost, then it
is expected that you get the main server if you don't
send a Host: header.

Please state what the main IP is, what each of the virtual
hosts should be, and include the relevant vhost sections
from your config.

 	Sorry.  We've solved the problem, but for the sake of making
 sure no one else runs into it I'll go through the questions and
 answer them. The person setting the server up :
 
 	1) Named the base machine www.XXX.com and gave it an IP
 	2) Configured Apache 1.2.4 for the base
 	3) Configured a few virtual hosts, one of which was www.XXX.com
 		but with different information except the same IP..
 
 
 	to fix
 
 	1) Rename machine to YYY.XXX.com  and gave new IP
 	2) Reboot.

 	I had created fresh copies of all the .conf files from
 a "form" I've used for dozens of other servers.  The virtual host was
 correct, but the fact that it was also the BASE systems IP/hostname was
 probably very wrong.

 	If you requested a cgi , it appeared to run ok. If you telnetted to the
 port (We have monitoring software that does that) and said "GET /cgi-bin/monitor.pl"
 it would tell you it didn't exist, or run it from the BASEs directory.

 	Not doing port based, IP based.

 	This is where you would have caught it.  
 
 		Sorry to trouble you.

 This problem does not exist with 1.3, and is one of the many subtle
 problems that forced me to create the NameVirtualHost directive so that
 folks won't have this happen to them by accident.  Or at least not have it
 happen so easily.
