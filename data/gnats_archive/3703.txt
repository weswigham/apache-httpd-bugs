Hi,

   Apache fails to start after installing Jserv 1.0.1b Giving the following error:
"The procedure entry point _ap_pclosesocket@8 could not be located in the dynamic link
library ApacheCore.dll"
>How-To-Repeat:
Not too sure.. Just install Apache 1.3.4 (Win32) and then install Jserv 1.0.1b.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled and tried a few things.. each time getting the same
result
>Fix:
No.. but if there is anything I can do to help please let me know.

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, you can help by taking two seconds to search the bugdb
before submitting a report.  There are already a half dozen
different reports of this, and in every case the answer
is the same: jserv b1 needs to be recompiled to be compatible
with 1.3.4.  It is not an Apache problem.
