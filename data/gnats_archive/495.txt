>Description:
I use SSIs to include JavaScripts (which have the ending .js on our system). 
Another developer was using the AddType directive to add a MIME type for
JavaScript, so he could do multipart-mixed responses, with the JavaScript in
one section of the response, and the HTML in another (and thereby avoid sending
back JavaScripts which could be seen via View Source). After he added the AddType,
I started getting errors from my SSIs due to "unable to include potential exec"
despite the fact that there is no Handler setup for .js files. Is this normal?
If so, is it really correct? 

I would think that a typed file without a handler or execute permissions could
still be included from a directory even if IncludesNOEXEC was set. We're going to
see more problems with this as more client-side scripting languages arrive.

What do you guys think?
>How-To-Repeat:
Simple. 

srm.conf:
AddType application/x-javascript .js

test.html: (in dir with IncludesNoExec config set)
<!--#include virtual="/path/to/javascript.js" -->

>Fix:
If a file of type X has no handler associated, is not executable, and is in a
dir which allows Includes but NoExec, allow the file to be included. If this is
not cool, maybe we need an IncludesNoExecButScriptsMayBeIncluded :%2

 The current behaviour sounds correct to me.  Don't name your SSIs with a
 .js... if you want them to be called something other than .html you could
 try .htmlf (html fragment) and "AddType text/html htmlf".  We open up lots
 of potential problems by changing this.

 Normally, I use ".inc" for "INClude". That's what I had to go back to. 
 I'm just sort of baffled as to why a file type without an appropriate
 handler is being rejected for inclusion by an SSI due to the *potential*
 for execution. I don't want to open up an asp. style hole in things,
 I just want to be able to name my file fragments so I can distinguish
 between them on disk. :) 
 
 Besides, a file without a registered ext should default to whatever the
 deafult MIME type is set to, right? So I shouldn't have to AddType for
 some random file fragment.
 
 Let me make sure I have the order right. 
 
  1) check MIME type of "random.js" using mime.types or AddType configs
  2) check server config
  3) check per-dir config
  4) reject due to potential for execution
 
 Where would a handler check go in this sequence?

 It's not just the potential of execution, it's the potential of displaying
 the wrong type of content (like perhaps displaying the code to something
 instead of executing it, or including a gif).  Of course you're free to
 remove/modify the test for "text/" in mod_include.c.
 
 There is also no way within the apache API to ask the question "if I run
 this subrequest will it use the default_handler or some other handler?"
 (you can get a partial answer depending on the server configuration, but
 there's no way to get a full answer).  So IncludesNoExec really means "do
 not run any subrequests that have content-type other than text/*". 
 
 A file without a registered extension will have the default type, yep.  So
 you're right, you don't need to "AddType text/html htmlf" in my example if
 you DefaultType is something like text/plain.  However if you AddType it
 now then you won't have problems if someone else in the future decides to
 AddType it changing the content type.
