 Oh damn.  Ok here's a patch that fixes this and the other mmap_handler
 error_log entries for 1.3b3.  It's against 1.3b3. 
 
 Thanks

   Put it in and working so far. No idea if this is a new bug or unrelated
 or what, but now I notice some of these:
 
 [crit] (24)Too many open files:
 /export/home/bryant/mpog_html/adverts/images/.htaccess pcfg_openfile:
 unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable
 
   the file does't exist at all.

 I'd be surprised if that's a new bug.  That looks like you started your
 server with insufficient descriptors.
