SunOS www 5.5.1 Generic_103640-14 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1 
>Description:
Running solaris 2.5.1 on ultrasparc

Currently running 1.2.5

Never had any problem with compiling apache.
No problem compiling apache 1.2.6 on a sparc 5 test system

Went to compilie it on a production system (ultrasparc) and received the
following error:

http_bprintf.c:18: math.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [http_bprintf.o] Error 1                                         
    


Any help would be great!

thanks

Marc

State-Changed-Why:
You don't have a proper C development environment
installed.  math.h is a standard header file that needs
to be present.   If it isn't on your system, then either
you don't have a properly installed compiler or someone
deleted it.

This isn't an Apache problem.
