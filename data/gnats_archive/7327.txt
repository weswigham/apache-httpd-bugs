>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6
Visual Studio 6.0
>Description:
First, it failed to create bucket (see code below). After I fixed the bug, WriteClient works only for buffer less than 4096 bytes. 

If I provide a buffer larger than 4096 bytes (defined as DEFAULT_BUCKET_SIZE in ap_buckets_heap.c), it will be chopped. The Content-Length is still correct, causing the client to wait for more data that will never arrive. 

If I divide the buffer into small sizes and call WriteClient multiple times, the data will be all send out, but the Content-Length was put into a bucket the first time it reaches an eos, causing the client to read only the first buffer and discard all the remaining buffers.
>How-To-Repeat:
Call WriteClient with a buffer larger than 4096 bytes.
Or, devide the buffer into small ones and call WriteClient multiple times.
>Fix:
Here is my suggestion. It works as I tested.

BOOL WINAPI WriteClient (HCONN ConnID, LPVOID Buffer, LPDWORD lpwdwBytes,
                         DWORD dwReserved)
{
    request_rec *r = ((isapi_cid *)ConnID)->r;
    ap_bucket_brigade *bb;
    ap_bucket *b;

    if (dwReserved == HSE_IO_SYNC)
        ; /* XXX: Fake it */

    bb = ap_brigade_create(r->pool);
	/***************** JJZ: Is this a bug?
    b = ap_bucket_create_transient(Buffer, (apr_size_t)lpwdwBytes);
	******************/
    b = ap_bucket_create_transient(Buffer, (apr_size_t)*lpwdwBytes);
    AP_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(bb, b);
	/***************** JJZ: eos caused Content-Length less than total of WriteClient
    b = ap_bucket_create_eos();
    AP_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(bb, b);
	******************/
    ap_pass_brigade(r->output_filters, bb);

    return TRUE;
}

State-Changed-Why:
This should be fixed some good time ago.  The buckets API
has changed several times, at a9 it was out-of-sync with
the mod_isapi (which unix bucket hackers can't test.)

Thanks for your report and interest in the Apache 2.0 Beta!
