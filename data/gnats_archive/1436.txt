>Environment:
mklinux 2.1/update5, power-Mac nubus, 100M RAM
>Description:
some times the server seems busy, for about 15 to 45 minutes. after this there is a message in the error log stating that the server is busy and respawned XX childs (maybe you have to incerease servers .....). But there were not more requests than 2 to 8 at this time and the number of servers is about 20.

If i restart the server with sighup it will work again, If I do nothing it will work after this time. 

I looked if the server is maybe cleaning its cache, but it seems not (I have setup a 500MB partition for proxy-cache)

Can you run "strace" against the parent and some children
to see what they're doing?

Are any of your files on NFS partitions?

 Hi,
 I now compiled the last availible release of apache 1.3B
 the problem seems to be gone (i mailed apache.org)
 If I have time, I will setup the old apache if you like
 (please mail).
 - no, no partition is on a NFS volume
 - something that may be different from other systems:
   I have a proxy-cache volume of about 600MB setup.
   Up to the last release of apache I had to clean /kill
   the cache volume because of corruption about every 10-15 days.
   Also since this new release the troubles maybe have gone.
 
 
 greetings
