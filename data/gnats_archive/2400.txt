>Description:
In http_main.c:

 /*
  * Globals common to main and worker threads. This structure is not
  * used by the parent process.
  */

 typedef struct globals_s {
 #ifdef UNGRACEFUL_RESTART
     HANDLE thread_exit_event;
 #else
     int exit_now;
 #endif
     semaphore *jobsemaphore;
     joblist *jobhead;
     joblist *jobtail;
     mutex *jobmutex;
     int jobcount;
 } globals;

 globals allowed_globals =
 {0, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0};

Shouldn't allowed_globals be defined as:
 globals allowed_globals =
 {0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0};
