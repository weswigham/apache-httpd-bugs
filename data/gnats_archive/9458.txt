>Description:
On Windows NT4.0 with NTFS apache cannot execute cgi script (perl script)
on path, witch not fit into short path. This problem not appear
on Windows 2000 with NTFS (only NT4.0).
Apache writes into error log:
-------<snip>---------
[Fri Jan 11 14:06:18 2002] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] d:/iczca/pp/scgi-bin/sys/i
mport_data is not executable; cannot translate to a short path name. (GetShortPa
thName() returns 0)
[Fri Jan 11 14:06:18 2002] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] couldn't spawn child proce
ss: d:/iczca/pp/scgi-bin/sys/import_data
-------<snip>---------
Problem is in src/main/util_script.c where a function GetShortPathName()
is called. I compiled short prog to test this function.
For path which fit into 8.3 it returns the same string (length),
for other strings it returns zero - fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try long script file name on Win NT4.0 on NTFS.
>Fix:
Maybe in the case of GetShortPathName() failure try to use
long file name version execution.
Execution fails too in the worst case.
