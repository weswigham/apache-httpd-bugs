 "Newest" doesn't help for the version.
 
 Where did you download the .msi from (dev.apache.org or www.apache.org?)
 What file did you download?  Please check the current release version
 at http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/ and report back,
 thanks!

 Just to clarify, what is your WinME's installed language?

 The same error occured at my computer (Win98SE). The cause turned out to be
 the an infection by the infamous Nimda virus. The virus, besides from other
 effects, messes up some windows installer files. Note the error is caused by
 the corrupt Windows Installer (the program that handles the installation of
 some programs, like Apache), not Apache software.
 
 Reinstalling Windows fixed the problem, although a less drastic solution
 would be welcome.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a reported to be a symptom of Nimda infection of
the Win32 Installer program.  Deinfection followed by
installation of the MSI upgrade should resolve the problem.
