¿How can I compile htpasswd.c under Win 32?
I haven't a file like MakeFile.NT
I don´t know how to compile this program under Windows because it uses others files .c and headers .h
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to compile it under Windows
>Fix:
Maybe you have a MakeFile script than you could send me.

State-Changed-When: Mon Jan  4 07:49:35 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This PR has been reported already as PR #1980.  As documented,
Apache for Windows does not support encrypted passwords, so there
is no binary for htpasswd, and no reason to create one.  To use
authentication on Windows, just create the password file with a 
text editor.  We are working on a fix to put encrypted passwords in
the Windows release, and we will provide htpasswd with the first version
that supports this function.

Thank you for using Apache.

 There is no crypt() on Win32, and Apache doesn't
 at this time support Encrypted passwords for Basic
 Auth on Win32.
