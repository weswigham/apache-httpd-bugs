>Environment:
SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-14 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
If you've got a filename, with two substrings that qualify as extensions,
and one of them is bound to a handler and one of them is bound to a content-type
(map files and gifs, for instance), you'll end up with both the handler and
the content-type set.  Since the handler takes precedence, this'll sometimes
do what you want and sometimes not.  My problem case was a GIF named 
assu.map.gif that'd end up getting handled by mod_imap.

>How-To-Repeat:
with mod_imap in your server, handling files with the ".map" ext, 
name a gif "something.map.gif" then grab it, it'll be a broken
image because the map handler's trying to deliver it
>Fix:
Don't know if it's the best way, but I reset the handler
back to orighandler if the content-type gets set or
changed based a string later in the filename:

*** mod_mime.c.orig     Thu Feb 12 16:31:53 1998
--- mod_mime.c  Thu Feb 12 16:32:31 1998
***************
*** 256,261 ****
--- 256,262 ----
          if ((type = table_get(conf->forced_types, ext))
              || (type = table_get(hash_buckets[hash(*ext)], ext))) {
              r->content_type = type;
+           r->handler = orighandler;
              found = 1;
          }

 I think this just falls into the "don't do that" category.  I've found
 that I frequently need to change the imap extension from .map to .imap
 because folks just tend to name geographical maps .map.
 
 Your change probably breaks some legitimate uses of SetHandler and such.

 It seems like the change would only affect AddHandler mappings, 
 since SetHandler is applied after and overrides the extension mappings.
 
 But if you don't like that, how about adding a "default" or "none" keyword 
 to SetHandler and AddHandler so it's possible to clear the handler that 
 gets assigned to a file?  Right now, if I want to have a directory full 
 of GIFs, and have them all served regardless of extensions, including any
 extensions that get added in the future, I can't do it because there's 
 no way to say "SetHandler to nothing so you do that default server thing 
 where you just copy this file out".  If I put
 
 ForceType image/gif
 
 in that dir, any file with, for instance, ".asis.gif" or ".map.gif" 
 or ".map" will get a handler assigned and it'll choke.  But if I could 
 also do
 
 SetHandler default
 or
 SetHandler none
 
 everything would work fine regardless of extensions.  And if I want to
 worry about it on a server-wide basis, I can put
 
 AddHandler default gif
 
 in my server conf.  It just seems that the common, uncomplicated, 
 and reasonable user expectation is that, if my file ends in ".gif" 
 it's an image and I want it served.
 
 thanks,
 Jeff

State-Changed-Why:
I like the suggestion to add "default" as a handler which overrides
other handlers... lemme see what others think.
