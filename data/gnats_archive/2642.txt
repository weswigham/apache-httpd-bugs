>Environment:
IRIX 6.2 on Indigo2. GCC compiler (sorry I don't have the version handy--I'm sure it's the latest though).
>Description:
This seems like it could be a bug. Just thought I'd bring this to someone's attention. It seems like if this is an assignment, it should be made more explicit--the if should be broken up for clarity. Otherwise, should be rewritten as "1 == r->chunked":



"http_protocol.c", line 302: warning(1184): possible use of "=" where "==" was

          intended

           ((r->proto_num >= HTTP_VERSION(1,1)) && (r->chunked = 1))) &&



>How-To-Repeat:
Compile the source.
>Fix:
I don't understand this code, don't have time to investigate, and am therefore not qualified to suggest a fix.

State-Changed-When: Sat Jul 18 20:35:22 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
No.  This code is correct, as the comment two lines above
notes.  Only broken compilers will complain about it;
things like modern versions of gcc won't because
of the extra set of ()s around it.
