>Description:
I can see in the release notes comments about the message that is printed if 
suexec is active being managed differently-- in 1.3.0, it was a simple fprintf() to 
STDERR. But now it seems to be entirely gone-- it isn't printed, it isn't in my
binary as a string, and it doesn't seem to be anywhere in the sources. That
complicates debugging suexec.

State-Changed-Why:

The message isn't missing, it's just been moved to the
error_log.  The fprintf() call was causing problems when
a suexec-enabled server was run in inetd mode.  The text of
the message has been changed, too.
