 Erm... you are going to have to be more specific than that.
 
 Are you using the proxy?
 
 Exactly what version of Apache are you using?
 
 What sorts of files are being created on disk?  What is the directory
 structure?  Where are they?  What is in them?  Why do you think they have
 anything to do with Apache?

 We analysed the problem and we think that a Perl cgi program
 was responsible.
 I think that you can close the bug report.
 If something new happen I will let you know.
