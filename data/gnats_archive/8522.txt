>Description:
\$ expansions are performed twice if the \ is not the first char in the expression, for example:

if FOO = BAR, then the expression
\$foo is evaluated to $foo, which is correct, but
x\$foo is evaluated to xBAR, when it should be x$foo
also x\\$foo is changed to x$foo whereas it should be x\BAR

>How-To-Repeat:

<!--#set var="FOO" value="BAR" -->
<!--#if expr="x\$foo = 'xBAR' -->
   Apache bug
<!--#else -->
    Correct behaviour
<!--#endif -->
>Fix:
The problem occurs because in get_ptoken(), when strings are being found, any \'s are stripped out, and they are also stripped out in parse_string() when they occur just before '$' 's. 

It works when the '\' is at the start, because it is not checked that it is a '\' when the string is being found (in get_ptoken()). This also means that an expression of \=foo if evaluated to false, but x\=foo is true.
