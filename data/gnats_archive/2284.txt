Linux mabell 2.0.33 #2 Thu Mar 5 21:02:48 PST 1998 i486 unknown
>Description:
When I set the ErrorDocument to be a CGI script, I am unable to use the
POST method when calling it.
Check this out...
=====================
srm.conf: ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/printenv
---------------------
When I connect to the server using 
  <FORM ACTION="http://ha.cker.com:420/cgi-bin/printenv" method="POST">,
  REQUEST_METHOD = POST.

However, when I connect to the server using
  <FORM ACTION="http://ha.cker.com:420/does_not_exist" method="POST">
  REQUEST_METHOD is reported to be GET.

>How-To-Repeat:
Check out http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~jarnold/food.html
  -and-   http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~jarnold/food2.html 
to see the examples.
>Fix:
If you guys don't want to spend the time to fix the situation, could you please
point me in the right direction to go about fixing it myself?

State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Wed May 27 16:06:36 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

This is no bug.
Error documents are always requested with the GET method
and I don't see a reason why Apache should allow people
to use POST.

Anyway... feel free to hack Apache yourself (see the
'custom_response' sections in http_request.c and
http_protocol.c).
If you submit a patch we can include it in our contrib
directory.
