SunOS 5.8 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
>Description:
The starting page has junk text, Im pretty sure it's not another language. I re-installed apache_1.3.9 right after to see if anything with my machine had changed and the re-install worked fine and the server worked fine also.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download the server from http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/solaris/

get apache_1.3.20-sun4u-sun-solaris2.280.tar.gz  
Install it and run it.

State-Changed-Why:

It probably is another language that your browser doesn't
know how to interpret.  Can you
1. Try viewing index.html.en directly to make sure
that looks okay.
2. Check the language settings of your browser to 
make sure you prefer the language tag "en".
