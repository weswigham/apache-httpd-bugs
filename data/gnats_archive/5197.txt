>Description:
On Solaris, the find command does not support -or and does not default to -print
as the action :-(

With the stock configure, I error out on

checking javadoc... /apps/jdk/current/bin/javadoc
checking jar... /apps/jdk/current/bin/jar
checking JSDK... configure: error: no javax.servlet.Servlet class or jar with it in /apps/jsdk/curr

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:

The following change to configure allowed the script to complete on Solaris 2.6:

# diff configure configure.original
<     JARS=`${FIND} ${JSDK_CLASSES} -follow \( -name "*.jar" -o -name "*.zip" \) -print |tr "\n" "
 "`
---
>     JARS=`${FIND} ${JSDK_CLASSES} -name "*.jar" -or -name "*.zip"|tr "\n" " "`
