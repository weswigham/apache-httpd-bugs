Linux 2.0.35 i586
gcc version 2.7.2.3
libc-2.07
>Description:
The INSTALL documentation states that an Apache server installed according
to the directions will be running at http://localhost/.  In fact, based on
the configuration files that are created with the default instructions, the
Apache server begins running at http://localhost:8080/ -- This is not a show-
stopper ... just confusing for newcomers to Apache.  Documentation patch below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow INSTALL directions exactly.  At line 438 (counting absolute lines),
after starting the server for the first time  with apachectl, the directions
say to go to http://localhost instead of http://localhost:8080 which is where
the default configuration sets it up.
>Fix:
I like the idea of leaving the default configuration on port 8080 until you figure
out how to move it to port 80 if that's what you want.  Apply the following patch
to the INSTALL file to fix the documentation to match the system:

*** INSTALL.DIST        Sat Sep 19 09:06:40 1998
--- INSTALL     Sun Sep 27 22:09:25 1998

*** 435,441 ****
          $ PREFIX/sbin/apachectl start
   
       and then you should be able to request your first document via URL
!      http://localhost/. Then stop the server again by running:
    
          $ PREFIX/sbin/apachectl stop

       configuration directives.

State-Changed-When: Sat Oct  3 06:25:52 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed for Apache 1.3.3 now, but I've added
an additional hint to the --without-confadjust option
and felt free to replade one instance of the
localhost reference to just a local relative path.
Thanks for your feedback.
