>Description:
In httpd.conf, if you declare a new Custom Log format, let's say called 'foobar', like this:

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%{REQUEST_METHOD}e /newdirectory/%{REQUEST_URI}e\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" foobar

Then, you try to access a page, let's say 'index.html' which has 5 inline images, that the browser needs to send subsequent GET requests to the server to retrieve them. You can see that in the first request (to index.html), the log file logs:

192.168.80.80 - - [26/Dec/1999:10:34:07 +0200] "GET /newdirectory/index.html HTTP/1.0" 200 2300 "-" "Mozilla/4.5 [en] (Win95; I)"

but, in the subsequent 5 requests to the images, each line in the log  shows:

192.168.80.80 - - [26/Dec/1999:10:34:07 +0200] "- /newdirectory/- HTTP/1.0" 200 7852 "-" "Mozilla/4.5 [en] (Win95; I)"

Notice the "-" dashes instead of the environment variables 'REQUEST_METHOD' and 'REQUEST_URI' that were inserted in the Custom Log format.

>How-To-Repeat:
Define a new Custom Log format like this:

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%{REQUEST_METHOD}e /newdirectory/%{REQUEST_URI}e\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" foobar

Then, build a simple index.html that loads another 2 inline images. Build a new VirtualHost and log the requests based on the new Custom Log 'foobar' format. Then try to fetch the the index.html file, and watch the two other requests for the images.

If this doesn't show, just hit 'Reload' and watch.
>Fix:
No, no suggesstions. But I think the normal behavior would be to show the requests, the REQUEST_STRING and the REQUEST_URI for each request to the server.
