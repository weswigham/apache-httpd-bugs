>Description:
Used proxypass and authentication.  Auth dialog pops up in browser, but cannot 
successfully authenticate.

May be similar to 5096,4741


>How-To-Repeat:
httpd.conf:
ProxyPass /virtual1/ http://www.foo.com/virtual1/
ProxyPassReverse /virtual1/ http://www.foo.com/virtual1/

access.conf:
<Directory proxy:*>
    Allow from all
    Order deny,allow
    AuthName "Restricted proxy area"
    AuthType Basic
    AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwd
    Require valid-user
</Directory>

Use /usr/local/apache/bin/htpasswd to create an entry in 
/usr/local/apache/passwd/passwd.  Point browser to http//apacheproxyserver/virtual1.


Can give valid URL on actual server on request in e-mail.
>Fix:
http://www.wede.de/sw/mod_proxy/proxy-transparent.html has a patch that, if the
problem is in the passing of the proper and expected authentication request,
supposedly fixes the problem.

 I have found out that this bug exists only when using authentication to
 protect resources using ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse.  When I add the
 following code, referencing the same password file as the proxied resources,
 the www-authentication works just fine:
 
 <Location /manual>
     order allow,deny
     allow from all
     deny from none
     AuthName "login for manuals"
     AuthType Basic
     AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/htdocs/passwd
     Require valid-user
     satisfy all
 </Location>
 
 Again, the authuserfile is the same one referenced in the following:
 
 <Directory proxy:*>
     order allow,deny
     allow from all
     deny from none
     AuthName "need to login"
     AuthType Basic
     AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/htdocs/passwd
     Require valid-user
     satisfy all
 </Directory>
 ProxyPass /virtual1/ http://www.collegis.com/virtual1/
 ProxyPassReverse /virtual1/ http://www.collegis.com/virtual1/
 ProxyPass /virtual1 http://www.collegis.com/virtual1/
 ProxyPassReverse /virtual1 http://www.collegis.com/virtual1
 ProxyPass /virtual2/ http://www.collegis.com/virtual2/
 ProxyPassReverse /virtual2/ http://www.collegis.com/virtual2/
 ProxyPass /virtual2 http://www.collegis.com/virtual2/
 ProxyPassReverse /virtual2 htthttp://www.collegis.com/virtual2
 
 But authentication only works for the /manual location.  The proxy location
 (/virtual1 or /virtual2) prompts for authentication, but does not properly
 authenticate.  To test:
 
 Go to http://ra.lab.collegis.com/manual and use username test1 password
 test2.
 Then go to http://ra.lab.collegis.com/virtual1 and use the same username /
 password.

 I have determined that when ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse are used, and the
 authentication directives (AuthName, AuthType, AuthUserFile, Require) are
 located in the <Directory proxy:*> area, the authentication will not ever
 succeed.  I moved the auth directives to a <Location /> directive (or
 whatever the ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse location is), and authentication
 works great.  I would suggest that ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse not fit
 into any authentication directives in <Directory proxy:*>, and instead
 require a <Location...> for them.  Additionally, one should be able to turn
 off "classical" proxy behavior (that is, when it is used by configuring
 one's browser for proxy) when using ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse.  This is
 primarily so that unauthorized proxy users would not abuse the proxy server
 when it is only used in a ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse configuration.
