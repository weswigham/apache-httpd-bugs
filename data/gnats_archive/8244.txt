State-Changed-When: Mon Aug 27 09:23:14 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
First off, the version of Apache you are using is THREE YEARS old.  We can not and do not support such ancient versions of Apache.  You need to upgrade to a current version before we can even think of helping.

Secondly, I have no problem loading the URL you give and have no reason to suspect there is any bug in Apache causing any problem.  More likely than not, you have some problem with the HTML on the pages that causes some clients to do unexpected things.  We can't help you debug your HTML.
