State-Changed-When: Mon Jan  7 16:15:59 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

You are not giving nearly enough information to diagnose the problem.  For example, the contents of the error log
is crucial.

However, this sounds like a problem that you should take
to a user support forum such as
http://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html
before submitting a bug report.

Thanks for using Apache!
