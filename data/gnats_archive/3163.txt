i know that thi isn't the right place for my question, but i hope you can help me.
I'm using netscape beta 2 under NT 4.0, and i see that all the request that netscape
send to the server (apache) are HTTP 1.0, so NamedVirtualHost dosen't work.
but, i know that up to 2.0 netscape support HTTP 1.1, where is the mistake ?

         thx

State-Changed-Why:
You are right, this isn't the right place.  Please do not submit
questions unrelated to Apache bugs here.

Navigator has never supported HTTP/1.1, and version 4.5 still
doesn't AFAIK.  It does, however, send the Host: header with
HTTP/1.0 requests which is all that is needed for name based
virtual hosts.
