>Description:
Quantifiers:
        ?           0 or 1 of the preceding text
        *           0 or N of the preceding text (N > 1)
        +           1 or N of the preceding text (N > 1)

implies that xy*z does not match xyz (N = 1)
>How-To-Repeat:
RewriteRule ^/xy*z$ /manual
Then test with http://.../xz, /xyz, /xyyz; all show you the manual page.
>Fix:
Change "*           0 or N of the preceding text (N > 1)"
to     "*           0 or N of the preceding text (N >= 1)"
in mod_rewrite.html

PS: I submitted this report with a wrong email address yesterday. Sorry.
