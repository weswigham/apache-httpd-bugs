>Description:
For a corporate site I'm developing, I'm using server side includes
extensively (via <!--#include virtual=""-->). Each of the pages
containing the include tags has the execute bits set, and XBitHack
is set to Full for the entire document tree. The site uses frames
throughout, although the following symptoms appear with or
without frames:

When the included information is updated, whether it's a static
file, or dynamically generated via CGI, the completed page does
not update when clicking on 'reload' in Netscape Navigator 3.01
or Internet Explorer 3.0. With Navigator, updates can be seen
when performing a 'shift-reload'.

For the CGI-generated information, I have attempted to compensate
for this problem by including properly formatted Last-Modified
headers in the output, but without success.
>How-To-Repeat:
URL's won't help, since you won't be able to update the files
being included.

However, this should demonstrate the problem.

Create two files, file 1 being the main HTML page, file 2 contains
just some simple text or HTML.

View file 1 in a browser to verify that file 2's information is
being included.

Edit file 2.

Click reload in the browser to see if the updated information
appears. For me, it doesn't without a 'shift-reload' in
Navigator.

I think I've read about a similar problem being reported in
Apache Week some time ago, but now that I've searched through
my archives, I cannot locate the reference. But as I recall, the
problem related to the server not properly propagating the
last modified date of included information through as the last
modified date of the final document.

Please contact me if you need further details.

State-Changed-Why:
This is the expected behaviour of XBitHack Full, and in the
docs we note that it allows the browsers to cache the file
based on the date of the .html file itself.  You are telling
the server that the #includes within the file do not affect
the "last modified date" of the file... which is clearly wrong
in your case.  It sounds like you shouldn't be using XBitHack.

If you look at your access_log after a reload you should see
a 304.  That indicates that the client asked "has it changed
since ..." and the server said No.  shift-reload bypasses this
cache validating step.

Thanks for using Apache!
