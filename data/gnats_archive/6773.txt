>Description:
Currently in mod_log_config it looks like the elapsed service time (%T) is computed by taking time(NULL) and subtracting r->service_time() from it.  Unfortunately, this doesn't provide nearly the granularity we need to do useful performance analysis of our server-side code.

We would really love to see in a future Apache release a logging facility that can return the elapsed request service time on the order of microseconds.

State-Changed-Why:

Please look at Apache 2.0 to solve this issue.  All times
on that platform are in ms... although there may be options
to choose more optimal/lower granularity time sampling.
