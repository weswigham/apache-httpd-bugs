>Environment:
Unknown, this bug was noticed from the browser side (actually using the
Harvest Gatherer).
>Description:
http response of HTTP/1.1 200 is incorrect if browser requests is HTTP/1.0
Server should respond using HTTP/1.0
Also on apache versions 1.2b4 and 1.2b7
>How-To-Repeat:
GET / HTTP/1.0
(Use telnet to see the headers, I am sure you know this.)
