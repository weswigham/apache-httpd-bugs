State-Changed-Why:
Section 3.7 of RFC 2068 defines the media type as being
case-insensitive.  If you have anything that is depending
upon a particular upper/lower case appearance, it's
broken.

What precisely is the problem?  If you had the following
lines in your config,

AddType application/x-Foo .Foo
AddType application/x-foo .foo

what would you expect to happen if x.foo and x.Foo were
requested?
