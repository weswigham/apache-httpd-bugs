>Description:
I get "Send Body Lost Connection" errors on all larger (30k+) images.
Hitting "Reload" in Netscape several times will eventually get the image
through.  This error does not occur when viewing the page from the Apache
server with Netscape, but happens from all remote locations.
I had no problem with Apache for OS/2 on the same machine using Warp.

>Fix:
I have not found fix yet. 
The problem shows up in both Release and Debug compilations.
MaxKeepAliveRequests 0 - might have made it a little bit better...
StartServers 2         - no different
ThreadsPerChild 40     - no different
In http_protocol.c I attempted to make it continue 10 times before returning
the error, as follows...  This did NOT make it work any better.
                else if (xretry < 10) {
                    xretry+=1;
                    continue;
                     }
                else {
                    log_unixerr("send body lost connection to",
%0

This should be fixed in the 1.3b3 beta release just
announced.  Please upgrade and try this again.  Thanks
for using Apache, particularly in alpha-test mode!
