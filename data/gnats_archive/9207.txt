>Description:
Upon compilation of the distribution code on VC6, a whole bunch of compiler warnings showed up. None of these warnings is critical, but it would be very easy to do away with all of them, which would make the compile much easier to run automatically...

State-Changed-When: Thu Dec 20 17:26:07 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This report is closed/unresolved.  Nor will it be resolved
for any 1.3 generation public release.

The problem comes in that these data types DON'T CONFLICT
ON ALL PLATFORMS.

In fact, 'correcting' them for win32 will introduce new
bugs on other platforms.  As you point out, all remaining
emits are harmless, and we don't expect any significant
new development to occur on the 1.3 branch.

Apache 2.0 compiles clean on win32 - when it doesn't, it's
a real issue that is addressed.  Because Apache 2.0 uses
the APR (Apache Portability Runtime) the data types are
normalized across platforms.

So this isn't an ongoing philosophy, but for the older 1.3
generation code, fixing harmless emits isn't worth the new
bugs that will be introduced on some of the many dozens of
platforms and compilers the Apache HTTP Project supports.

Thanks for your report and interest in the Apache project.

 I find your comment disturbing.

 It will take some time until 2.0 will be released. Hence 1.3 is still
 important..

 Secondly, I have gone through the warnings, and save for a few socket
 issues, most of these warning can go away in a manner that is portable.
 For example, there are quite a few

 Int < size_t problems, where the int is just an iteration variable.
 Making it a size_t too will make the problem go away in a totally
 portable manner.
