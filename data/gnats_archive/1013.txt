Not the same as the infamous HTTP/1.1 reply debate.

When i specify "HTTP/1.1" on the request line,
Apache says it cannot understand the request.
If it supports HTTP/1.1 in its responses, i
assume that it should also support HTTP/1.1 in
requests, right?
>How-To-Repeat:
Connect directly to Apache with Telnet and type "GET / HTTP/1.1":

% telnet www.apache.org 80
Trying 204.62.130.149...
Connected to www.apache.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1

 Wow and I thought I was terse!  You're missing the Host: header.  See
 RFC2068.
