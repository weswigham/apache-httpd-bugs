When executing a CGI from another CGI (one that created a form) the SCRIPT_NAME 
and REQUEST_URI variables appear to have an extra proceeding slash, 
see example below. It also appears in the SCRIPT_FILENAME.


REQUEST_METHOD=POST
REQUEST_URI=//csTAC/changeuser.cgi/form
SCRIPT_FILENAME=/disk0/local/apache/share/htdocs//csTAC/changeuser.cgi
SCRIPT_NAME=//csTAC/changeuser.cgi        
>How-To-Repeat:
Have a CGI create a form that is sent to another CGI for parsing.

 Erm... what do you mean "executing a CGI from another CGI"?  
 
 How exactly are you doing this?

 I moving some working programs from NCSA/1.4.2 under Linux to Apache
 1.3.1 on a Digtal Unix station.  One of the programs is used to update
 some data fields stored on the server.  
 
 To simplify things (at least for me!), I use the same program to create
 the script and then parse it the next time around (if they left anything
 out, it can just redisplay the form with the data they did put in asking
 for what they left out).  When running in 'test mode', it does a
 system("printenv > /tmp/maint.env") so I can make sure the environment
 variables are what I'm expecting (that's where the piece I sent came
 from). 
 
 The first 'call' is just a link to the URL with '/form' in PATH_INFO.  I
 check to see if it is a GET or POST then, if a GET, check the PATH_INFO
 to make sure it is a form request.
 
 (Well, isn't that funny.  I was actually accessing the pages as I wrote
 this and checking the environment dump and it seems that it must do it the
 first time as well.  I thought it was okay the first time and messed up
 the second, but it is now doing it the first time as well.  Maybe I was
 looking at the wrong window last night.)
 
 Anyway, the first time it creates the form and the second time it parses
 it.  During the parse, it checks to make sure that the document is a form
 from itself (to try to eliminate junk forms) by comparing HTTP_REFERER to
 "http://"+SERVER_NAME+SCRIPT_NAME+"/form" (I see I can now use REQUEST_URI
 for the last two).
 
 Anyways, as I showed in the text sent, it looks like SCRIPT_NAME has an
 extra leading '/', which also appears in REQUEST_URI (presumably gotten by
 catting SCRIPT_NAME+PATH_INFO) and in SCRIPT_FILENAME (by catting
 DOCUMENT_ROOT+SCRIPT_NAME).
 
 I'm sorry I posted the problem incorrectly.  I must have been tired last
 night.
 
 If you need any more information, please let me know.
 
 John

 Okay, now I must be tired today.  When I sent the message before, I was
 running the cgi's on the old system, and checking the debug files on the
 new system (it never changed, it was from last night).  (I guess that's what I
 get for getting 2 hours of sleep, working 13 1/2 hours at one job, then
 going to another and trying to write cgi scripts and debug code)
 
 Now it is working properly.  I added some code to check for '//' at the
 front and strip out one of them, but now it isn't doing it at all.
 
 I'll try some more and see what happens.  I have three other programs to
 port.
 
 John
