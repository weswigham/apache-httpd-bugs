>Description:
I have just installed Apache Server for Windows '95 and keep on obtaining the
error message 'httpd: cannot determine local host name
Use ServerName to set it manually' - could you kindly tell me what is wrong.
I using your latest version of Apache.
I have checked your bugs reports & can't find any reference to this problem.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jun 19 10:03:50 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
It means exactly what it says.  Look in your config files,
see the ServerName line.  It must be set because Apache
can't figure it out on your system.  See the docs for
details.
