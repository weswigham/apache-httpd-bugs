>Description:
"apachectl configtest" does not detect duplicate Listen statements.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add two duplicate listen statements to httpd.conf, ie:

Listen 127.0.0.1:80
Listen 127.0.0.1:80

Run "apachectl configtest" - it will say "Syntax OK".  Try a restart, and the
server will fail to proceed, logging "[crit] (125)Address already in use:
make_sock: could not bind to address 127.0.0.1 port 80"
>Fix:
Add checking for duplicate Listen statements to "apachectl configtest".
