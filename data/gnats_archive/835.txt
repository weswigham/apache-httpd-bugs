>Environment:
BSDI 3.0 using gcc and apache 1.2.1
>Description:
My BSDI 3.0 comes with apache 1.1.3 which is configured to
place all log files in /var/log/httpd, per the ErrorLog and
TransferLog directive.  But there is not "logs" directory in
the apache install directory.

Apache 1.2.1 needs a "logs" directory at the same level as the
conf and docs directory.  This is an undocumented change in
requirements?

Previous versions of apache did not require the "logs" directory.


A quick grep of httpd.h reveals the problem:

httpd.h:#define DEFAULT_LOCKFILE "logs/accept.lock"
>How-To-Repeat:
Use ErrorLog and TransferLog directives to point to /tmp.
Remove the "logs" directory in the apache install directory.
Now start httpd.  I get a complaint about unable to create a
file.  
>Fix:
Make it clear that the "logs" directory must exist even if
you redirect your ErrorLog and TransferLog somewhere else

 From src/CHANGES:
 
   *) CONFIG: The LockFile directive can be used to place the serializing
      lockfile in any location.  It previously defaulted to /usr/tmp/htlock.
      [Somehow it took four of us: Randy Terbush, Jim Jagielski, Dean Gaudet,
      Marc Slemko]
 
 That's the directive you'd use to move it.  You don't need a logs
 directory you just need to move the lock file.
