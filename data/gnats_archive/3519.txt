Hi!  I'm not really sure, if the following is something for a change request.

But should ACTION-scripts not be always executed by apache?
Right now it seems to me that Action-scripts will only be executed,
if they are matching the cgi-handler (by extension or directory).

e.g.

 #ScriptAlias <none set for some reason> 

 # -- PHP 3 with Oracle access
#AddType     application/x-httpd-php3  .php3
#Action      application/x-httpd-php3  /cgi-bin/php
AddHandler  php3-script   .php3
Action      php3-script   /cgi-bin/php.cgi   #(link to php)
                                      ^^^^  is working

Using the directive (as proposed)
  Action      php3-script   /cgi-bin/php
reports an error like: http://..../cgi-bin/php/abcdefg/xyz.php3 Not found
(because not recognized as cgi due to the unset ScriptAliases-Directive)

Access rights were set properly...

If this is not a bug, but a feature, please make the doc of "Action"
somewhat clearer (it took me 2 days to figure this out...).

No, I don't see why they should always be executed.  It is very
possible that you want someone to be able to use the Action
directive for existing scripts without letting them make arbitrary
things executable.

If you have any particular suggestions for areas where the docs
could be improved, please send them, but we really can't do
much with a general "they aren't good".

 IMO it's makeing no sense to install a Action-Script without the
 possibility of executing it. (Perhaps I didn't make myself clear
 enough for understanding - sorry my English is not the best...)
 
 A Action directive contains a script which should be executed, when
 the Action condition is triggered. If the Action-Script doesn't match
 the CGI-handler conditions, the Action-script IMO will not be executed.
 
 e.g.:
  Addhandler    cgi-handler .cgi .pl
  ScriptAlias   /cgi-bin/   /cgi-bin
  Action        ph3-script  /some-other-dir/php
 
 The question here is: Should Apache execute /some-other-dir/php?
 IMO: Yes.
 
 Today for most apache webmasters this is a minor problem, because
 they have these programms installed in /cgi-bin and are using the
 default ScriptAlias - directive to make /cgi-bin/php match the cgi-
 handler conditions.
 
 ==> But this is a minor problem - the real problem was to understand
     the Action mechanism - and looking on the php mailing lists,
     most newbies have the same problem (so: I'm not alone ;-)).
 
     I think improving the doc a little bit will make this topic much
     clearer for newbies.

 Yep - You are right! Sorry!
 The docs should contain some hints for the Action directive:
 
 1. Correct "Action mime-type ..."  --> "Action handler ..."
    (see our discussion/ my question in news-group: 
 comp.infosys...server.unix)
 
 2. Action  <handler> <cgi-script> has to match the cgi-handler 
 conditions.
    Which means: the script should be placed in a directory covered
    by the ScriptAlias directive, and/or should follow the cgi-script 
 naming
    convention (filename extension).
 
    This is necessary to make apache execute the Action script.
 
 3.  e.g.:
 
       AddHandler    cgi-handler  .cgi
       #ScriptAlias  /cgi-bin/    /cgi-bin
       AddHandler    php3-script  .php3 .phtml
       Action        php3-script  /cgi-bin/php
 
     will not work, because /cgi-bin/php doesn't match the cgi-handler 
 conditions.
 
     WorkAround:
 
      Use ScriptAlias - directive to make all files in /cgi-bin 
 "executable" to apache.
      (This is the default)
 
     Or:
 
      If you have disabled the ScriptAlias directive, you can use the 
 following config:
 
      AddHandler cgi-handler  .cgi
      Action     php3-script  /cgi-bin/php3.cgi
      (make a link from php to php.cgi)
