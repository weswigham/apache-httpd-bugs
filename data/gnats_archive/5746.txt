>Description:
When I use the DirectoryIndex command to append index.html to a directory
name, the Apache server uses the host that is specified by Servername rather
than the canonical host name that was passed in.

So, for I type in a URL of:
http://canonical.name/my_directory/

I expect the apache server to serve up
http://canonical.name/my_direcotry/index.html

Instead, it tries to redirect me to
http://my.real.servername:8080/my_directory/
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, the real machines are behind firewalls here, so I can't give
you a real URL to try.  However, it should be fairly easy to test out by
creating a server with a valid ServerName directive and then set 
UseCanonicalName On
DirectoryIndex index.html

Finally, visit the webserver using a name other than what is set as the 
ServerName and view the info of that page to see what is the actual URL
that your browser is now pointing to...
>Fix:
I'll check out the ModRewrite rules as I believe that UseCanonicalName is
a convenient wrapper around the ModWrite package and see what I can do with
that.

 Sorry, can't be done and it isn't your problem but their problem.
 
 How does your box know what port their proxy is listening on?  It
 doesn't.  When stuff is proxied to you, the request is made to the port
 your server is running on.  Your server isn't told anything about this
 magic proxy running on who knows what port.
