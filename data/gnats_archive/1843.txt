>Description:
I used to have several of these sections in srm.conf:

RewriteCond     %{HTTP_REFERER} ^$			[OR]
RewriteCond     %{HTTP_REFERER} !\.(kluge\.net|wpi\.edu)
RewriteCond     %{REMOTE_HOST}  !^.*\.kluge\.net$
RewriteRule     ^/icons/        -                       [F]

Which will block any requests for files under the /icons/ directory which 
weren't referred to by pages on two domains (kluge.net and wpi.edu).  If one
of the systems on my domain (kluge.net) would request a file under /icons/, it
would be accepted no matter what.

This has worked fine for various versions of Apache, but started denying all
requests when I upgraded to 1.3b5.  I modified the rewrite commands to be a
little more lenient with denials (it'll now only deny if there is a referer
and it's not from the specified domains.)
>How-To-Repeat:
no.  (I traced it down to mod_rewrite by changing the "RewriteEngine on" to
"RewriteEngine off", and it started to work.)

 I put the old configuration back in, and restarted the new apache binary.
 Things work fine again.  Thanks. 8)
