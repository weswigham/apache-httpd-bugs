>Description:
This code in handle_include:

                /* be safe; only files in this directory or below allowed */
                char tmp[MAX_STRING_LEN + 2];
                ap_snprintf(tmp, sizeof(tmp), "/%s/", parsed_string);
                if (parsed_string[0] == '/' || strstr(tmp, "/../") != NULL) {
                    error_fmt = "unable to include file \"%s\" "
                        "in parsed file %s";
                }

Is broken if parsed_string overflows that buffer.  It's possible to put
whatever crap at the beginning then loads of ../../../ after that, and they
won't be detected.

It also needs os_is_absolute_path abstraction.

It shouldn't use a tmp buffer to do this.  It should be replaced by an
intelligent os abstracted function that checks for leading ../ and trailing
/.., and /../ anywhere else, and doesn't bother copying things around.

This problem is fixed in 1.2.  And in 1.3 it's fixed for unix,
but not for win32 yet.
