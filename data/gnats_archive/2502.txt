>Description:
Sometimes the proxy module is automatically inserting date at the beginning 
of any item from proxy.  Maybe browser caused.  Never experienced this problem on 1.3b7 and under.


>How-To-Repeat:
I am not sure how to repeat.  But this problem seems to be aggrevated by downloading a file type not handled by browser such as exe files.
>Fix:
Sorry not sure
