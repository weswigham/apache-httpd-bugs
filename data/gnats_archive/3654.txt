State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended
State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Mon May  3 14:43:52 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:

If this gets added, it will have to be in the form of an
option so that it won't dismay people who like the border.
I'm suspending this for future consideration.

State-Changed-From-To: suspended-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug  7 06:30:11 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

The IndexOption -IconsAreLinks allows you to turn these
borders off.  Stylesheets, which may be introduced in the
future, would allow further control over the appearance.
