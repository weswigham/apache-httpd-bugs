Linux 7.1, kaffe
>Description:
I am not able to acces numeric fields from oracle database using jdbc thin driver, when I am using Apache Jserv ( Java VM kaffe ), I can retrieve Character fields. 

I Installed jdk1.3.1 and I succesfuly retrieved both Numeric and Character fields using a Console Program, not a servlet.

The console program also failed using kaffe.

The default Virtual machine of linux is kaffe.  I tried to edit jserv.properties file modified the wrapper.bin from kaffe to jdk, but when I tried it is reporting "Internal Server Error"

So please send me How to convert linux default Virtual Machine from kaffe to jdk1.3.1.  

I tried by changing the CLASSPATH and PATH variables

Try to change Jserv Virtual Machine from Kaffe to jdk1.3.1
