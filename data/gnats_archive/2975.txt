 1.2.4 is very ancient.  As we make it very clear, please be sure you
 upgrade to a current version of Apache.

 Exactly what URL are you trying to access when you get this?  
 
 Do you have any extra modules, or is this just a normal directory?
 
 What happens if you actually try following the link?
 
 What if you telnet to the server on port 80 and try getting it yourself?
 
 eg.
 
 telnet server 80
 GET /whateveryouaretryingtoaccess HTTP/1.0
 
 (note the blank line)
 
 ?
