Linux ns2 2.2.16-22 #1 Tue Aug 22 16:16EST 2000 i586 unknown
>Description:
We were attempting to set up FrontPage extenstions on our server (Fp50.linux.tar.Z) the program completed normally but when we restarted httpd I get an error saying the Invailid Command 'LoadModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in server Configuration.  I went a head and tried to reinstall Apache 1.3.19 and the same error has occured.
>How-To-Repeat:
I followed the limited directions form www.microsoft.com/frontpage
>Fix:
That is what I am hoping you can tell me...
