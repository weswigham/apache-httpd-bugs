Solaris 2.5.1, gcc linked with ld
>Description:
I had a rewrite rule that under 1.2.1  that basically redirected everything
back to a certain machine, except for certain CGI's. *which are authenicated*

This worked fine under 1.2.1, but since I upgraded the server to 1.2.5, 
it no longer works, I am receiving Forbidden errors, for the
CGI's that I wish not to redirect.  See  example below.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here's my RewiteRule

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/protected-cgi-bin/foo.cgi
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/protected-cgi-bin/foo2.cgi
RewriteRule /(.*) http://www.server.com/$1 [L,R]

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr  7 23:52:53 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Although the correct ruleset would be

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/protected-cgi-bin/foo\.cgi$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/protected-cgi-bin/foo2\.cgi$
RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://www.server.com/$1 [L,R]

(remember that the patterns are regex) I cannot
reproduce your wrong behaviour. At least under 1.3b6-dev
mod_rewrite evaluates the ruleset correctly. I got
redirects for any URL except for the two listed
CGI URLs. So, I expect that there are some other
rulesets in your configuration which cause the wrong
behaviour. Please double-check your configuration
or at least enable RewriteLogLevel 9  and look
what the RewriteConds actually evaluate.

 Hi,
 
 I was able to figure it out thanks to your help.  It
 was definitely a configuration issue.
 
 I was setting these in the Apache 1.2.5 server
 
 ErrorDocument 401 /server/http-err-401.html
 etc...
 
 I needed to NOT redirect /server, for my rewrites
 to work correctly. 
 
 Thanks much for your help, and sorry for wasting your time.
 Will

Ok, we can close this report. It was a configuration
problem and not a bug.
