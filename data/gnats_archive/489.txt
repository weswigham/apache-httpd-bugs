# 
# Synopsis: POST to directory mapped to CGI appears as GET
# 
# State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
# State-Changed-By: marc
# State-Changed-When: Sun Feb 16 02:27:34 PST 1997
# State-Changed-Why:
# Can you please send me the exact configuration directives
# and paths/URLs you are trying to access that show this
# problem?

Config directives:

DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi
ScriptAlias /m/eclips/cgi /e

somefile.html:
	
	<form method=POST action="/">
	...input variables...
	</form>

Details:
In '/' resides index.cgi, a symlink to /m/eclips/cgi/uadmin, which
functions as I would expect when accessed directly. However, when I POST
to it as '/', the REQUEST_METHOD is in fact GET, no data is sent to
stdin of the script, and QUERY_STRING is empty.

Let me know if you need anything more.

Thanks!
