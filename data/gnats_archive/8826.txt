>Description:
I started with the standard httpd-std.conf copied to httpd.conf.  The relevant
parameters were:
<IfModule threaded.c>
StartServers         3
MaxClients         150
MinSpareThreads     25
MaxSpareThreads     75
ThreadsPerChild     25
MaxRequestsPerChild  0
</IfModule>
83 processes are created.
When (keeping other parameters the same) I reduce START_SERVERS to 1, 29
processes are created.

I was under the impression that the Threaded mpm would create a small number
of processes and field requests with threads inside those processes.  Instead
it creates a very large number of processes more than prefork mpm.  This makes
threaded mode essentially useless for a small server where I would like to keep
the number of processes as small as possible.

I noticed similar behavior in worker mpm.  perchild mpm would not compile.  Is
why preforked mpm is currently default for linux?

Threads show up in ps on Linux in a very similar way to processes.  That's just the way Linux is, nothing to do with Apache...

Here is some more info about Linux ps and how to distinguish between processes and threads...

Try 
ps ax -O ppid,flags,wchan | grep httpd

A "process" with "rt_sig" in the 4th column is actually a
thread and not a process in its own right.

Also, threads will list their owning process in the ppid
column (2, in this example).

 In this case the PID's are all different. That looks like different processes
 to me, rather than multiple threads inside a process. This is the output of
 "ps wwalx" with
 	StartServers 	     1
 	MaxClients         150
 	MinSpareThreads     25
 	MaxSpareThreads     75 
 	ThreadsPerChild     25
 	MaxRequestsPerChild  0

Comment-Added:
I realize it seems strange for threads to be listed with separate pids, but that's just the way it is with Linux.
Hacks are even required in the source code to deal with this.

This is an intentional design on the part of the Linux kernel folks, so it is unlikely to change.  Certainly
it is not an Apache issue.  We can only do what is required
internally to ensure that it doesn't confuse the code.

 Threads show up in ps on Linux in a very similar way to processes.
 
 What more can I say!?!?
 
 If you don't like how Linux does this, then don't use it... or do a quick
 web search on the issue, and I'm sure you can find thousands of
 discussions of what Linux does and why they think it is the right thing to
 do, and why many many other people disagree.
