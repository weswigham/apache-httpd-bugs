I am running 
1/ window nt 4 service pack 3.
2/ apache web server 1.3.3 for win32
3/ hardware is PII 400 , 256Mb phyical ram , 270 Mb Page.sys
>Description:
Dear webmaster,
I have tested the apache web server in my nt4 service pack 3 platform reacently, 
their're some problems that I hope you can improve in the next version of apache.

1/ I have created 10,500 name based virtual host at httpd.conf. It takes me 45 mins
to start the apache server and it also catched 240mb memory. Since I have 256mb 
virtual memory so the apache work very good , fast and statble.

2/ Soon I want to add 10 more domain at httpd.conf <virtual host ... > section, and try 
to force apache to reread the conf files. I used to type apache -k restart and apache 
reread all the 10,510 vhost again, it takes me 50 mins to restart the apache server.

The most important question is, could you force the apache to reread the new added vhost 
or new deleted vhost only without needed to reread the WHOLE EXISTED VHOST? (I have read 
a lot of news messages they reply apache -k restart, this command is to reread the whole 
httpd.conf, I want apache to reread the new added vhost at httpd.conf only.)

Another question is when I want to shutdown the apache server, I used apache -k shutdown.
The nt4 's taskmgr shows me that the memory is increasing to about 400mb and then drop back
to 80mb. Why apache need nearly double siz of memory to shutdown?

Last question is when I restart the apache web server the cpu goes up to 100%, at the same time
I use other network to query the apache server eg.. http://www.vhosted-domain.tld , netscape responded 
"the server is down". Of course after the cpu drop to normal 5%, the query success again.
(I found that this is not the cpu's problems, just the apache -k restart cannot gracefully restart
at win32, the apache just stop answer all the incoming querys when it is doing restart.)

If you need more details, please don't hesiate to email me. Thank you for your concern.

P.s. I compared apache1.3.3 to iis4 and found apache is better at the proformance, used
less registry and httpd.conf is very easy to backup. If you can solve the above reread(restart)
and memory problems, apache will beat iis4 at win32 enviroment.

State-Changed-Why:
First, are you sure you really need that many vhosts?
If you don't have extensive configuration required for each
one that is different, then you may be able to just use 
mod_rewrite without any virtualhosts to rewrite requests
based on the Host: header.

I can't duplicate your problem of using that much memory.
Do you perhaps have a large number of added directives
(eg. aliases) in the main server config?  Those will all 
be inherited by each vhost.  If you do, then make the main
server into a vhost and move them all into that so they aren't
inherited by each vhost.

If that doesn't help, then please send any added config
directives plus an example vhost section.

The reason why it takes more memory to shutdown or restart
is because the Apache process you start to do -k shutdown/restart
has to read the config files to find the PID file.  If you
point the restart/shutdown process at a config file with only the ServerRoot and
PidFile directives in (using the -d or -f command line 
options), then it should be faster.

It is unlikely that we will ever provide any incremental
adding of vhosts due to the complexity.  It is not appropriate,
however, for it to take the times you are reporting to start.
