>Description:
I was trying to work around a possible Internet Explorer bug, and noticed that
URLs of the form

    http://host/cgi-bin/script/http%3a%2f%2fotherhost/...

don't work.  I was purposely encoding / as %2f (which I think ought to be valid)
to try and avoid what appears to be the removal of // or at least collapse of //
to / by MSIE.

>How-To-Repeat:
The following CGI script demonstrates the problem:

#!/bin/sh

echo "Content-type: text/plain"
echo ""
echo "PATH_INFO: $PATH_INFO"

When invoked as (for example):

http://yourhost/cgi-bin/rdir/http%3a%2f%2fwww.apache.org/

the response seen in Netscape is

Not Found

The requested URL /cgi-bin/rdir/http://www.apache.org/ was not found on this server.

If you invoke it as

http://yourhost/cgi-bin/rdir/http%3a//www.apache.org/

it works fine.
>Fix:
Unfortunately, no.

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, this is a known problem.  It, along with an explaination
of why it is currently done that way, is in PR#543.

It will be tracked under that PR; it isn't an easy fix because,
while it is probably small, it requires some effort to
verify.
