>Release:        JServ 0.9.11/Apache 1.3.0
>Environment:
Any OS, problem in Java code
>Description:
<SERVLET> parameters enclosed in single-quotes are not handled 
correctly in SGMLTag.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try reading the value of a parameter passed to a Servlet called
through a <SERVLET> tag in a jhtml file, e.g.
<SERVLET NAME=test>
<PARAM NAME=foo VALUE='quotes are passed as part of value'>
</SERVLET>
>Fix:
The following modified version of SGMLTag.nextToken() corrects the problem:

    public static String nextToken(String string, int index)
    {
        String token = "";
        char c = string.charAt(index);

        // quoted string? (handle both single and double added)
        if (c == '"' || c == ''') {
            boolean inSingle = false;
            boolean inDouble = false;
            if (c == ''') inSingle = true; else inDouble = true;
            token += c;
            do {
                c = string.charAt(++index);
                if (c == '\\') token += string.charAt(++index);
                else token += c;
            } while ((inDouble && c != '"') || (inSingle && c != '''));
        }

        // parameter delimiter?
        else if (isDelimiter(c))   
            token += c;

        // word token?
        else if (!isWhiteSpace(c)) {
            do { token += c; c = string.charAt(++index); }
            while (!isWhiteSpace(c) && !isDelimiter(c));
        }

        // otherwise, give back a null
        else token = null;

        return token;
    }

State-Changed-Why:
This is fixed in the latest version of JServSSI.  You can
get this with the latest snapshot of the JServ source tree
(the 0.9.x tree is no longer in development); the snapshots
are available from http://java.working-dogs.com/daily/

This bug will be marked closed when a checkpointed version
of the 1.0b development tree is released, unless we hear
that this is still a problem.

State-Changed-Why:
marked closed based on more reasonable criteria (since the
fix is available in source form...).
