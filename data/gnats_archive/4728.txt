Linux 2.1.24 #129 Thu Jul 9 13:35:11 EST 1998 ppc unknown
>Description:
If the .htpasswd file is on a filesystem that has become full, then if the "htpasswd" binary is executed to add a new web user the existing data in ,htpasswd will be wiped out before the binary realizes the filesystem is full and aborts with an error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Fill the filesystem that ".htpasswd" sits on, then try to add a new username via the "htpassed" binary.
>Fix:
Have the binary somehow test to see if it can completely write the new ".htpasswd" file before it actually opens ".htpasswd" for writing.
