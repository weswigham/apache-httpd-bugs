 Do you mean that the the first well requests are served slowly; i.e. it
 takes quite some time for the pages to come up ? 
 
 If it is just during startup the case, then you might want to
 read the documentation
 on
 	http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_proxy.html#startup
 titled
 	'Why does Apache start more slowly when using the proxy module?'
 
 If this does not apply, i.e. the webserver is already running, but it is
 just the first cache request; then a second reason might be that apache,
 upon the first cache access, will do a full cleanup check on the entire
 cache, prior to serving. I.e. any stale pages are removed, etc.
 
 This has been fixed in 1.3.x where apache will 'fork' off a separate
 child to do these janitorial chores. Freeing the server to serve the
 proxy request quickly.
