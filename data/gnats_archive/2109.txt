** WARNING: We have no explicit knowledge about shared object
** support for your particular platform. But perhaps you have
** luck: We were able to guess the compiler and linker flags
** for creating shared objects from your Perl installation.
** If they actually work, please send the following information
** for inclusion into later releases to apache@apache.org or
** make a suggestion report at http://bugs.apache.org/:
**     PLATFORM=i386-whatever-openbsd
**     CFLAGS_SHLIB=-DPIC -fPIC
**     LDFLAGS_SHLIB=-Bforcearchive -Bshareable
**     LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT=

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your feedback. I've comitted the following
patch for 1.3b7 based on your information. If it works
for you (I espect this because I only removed -DPIC
which is not used by Apache) there is no need to reply.
If not, please reply immediately and say what is still
wrong for DSO support under OpenBSD.
Thanks.
