>Environment:
Linux apollo 2.0.36 #1 Tue Oct 13 22:17:11 EDT 1998 i686 unknown

>Description:
[root@apollo bin]# ./apachectl start
Syntax error on line 30 of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
API module structure `env_module' in file /etc/httpd/modules/mod_env.so is garb?
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started
[root@apollo bin]#
>How-To-Repeat:
I had Apache 1.3 and got the latest version down from the web for 1.3.6.  I
gunzip, tar -xvf apache*.tar, then I read all of the README's.   I put in the
command:   "./configure --prefix=/etc/httpd --enable-module=so", I pressed enter, 
then I typed "make", then I typed "make install" as per the directions.  Then I
type the command "./apachectl start", as you can see above and got the error.
I went back to the apache directory and tried a "make clean" and then did the same 
thing as above.   BTW, I originally stopped "httpd" before I did the make install.
>Fix:
I have no suggestions, I have searched the apache.org website for clues.  I have
asked our on-staff programmer.  No answers from anyone.  Please help!

State-Changed-Why:
Please check to make sure that your config file is looking
for the modules in /etc/httpd/libexec.  Some distributers 
put Apache files in different directories, and when you grab
the source, and compile yourself, we cannot detect where the
old modules were.  Apache also does not install a new httpd.conf
over the old one, so if the new modules are installed in a 
new directory, it is not finding them.
