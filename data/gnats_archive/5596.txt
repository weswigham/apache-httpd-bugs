>Environment:
I'm using Apache 1.3.9 for OS/2, but thats not of any relevance since the
problem is with the documentation.
>Description:
The file ip-based.html on the VirtualHost documentation doesnt list all
the directives that should not be used under <VirtualHost>, the file
only lists a few, but doesn't mention all the 28 directives that can't
be used. (atleast i've found 28, i can't be sure if there are more)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
either make a list of all the directives that can't be used, or just
mention that there are others that are not listed.
