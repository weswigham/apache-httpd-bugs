 There is a similar problem after hitting Shift+Refresh a number of times.
 (For me, five.)
 The error log reads:
 
 [Tue Mar 13 09:30:22 2001] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client
 socket) failed with errno = 10022

 Even hitting Refresh on the default home page causes the Icon not to appear
 and the server hangs.
