>Environment:
windows.html file with 1.3.0 release
>Description:
1)In the section "Downloading Apache for Windows", where the .tar.gz file is discussed, it seems incorrect to say that "You will have to convert at least the .mak and .dsp files to have DOS line endings before MSVC will understand them)."  In my experience there is no need to change the .dsp files for MSVC at all, at least on Win 95. 

2)In the section "Compiling Apache for Windows", there are more than three projects in   "The three projects that are necessary for Apache to run are Apache.dsp, ap/ap.dsp, regex/regex.dsp, ApacheCore.dsp and os/win32/ApacheOS.dsp. The src/win32 subdirectory contains project files for the optional modules (see > below)."

3)In the section "Compiling Apache for Windows", the projects main/gen_test_char.dsp and main/gen_uri_delims.dsp should also be added to the list of required projects.
