FreeBSD 4.1.1-STABLE

>Description:
lock functions in APR seem to do not call pthread_mutex_destroy when APR_USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED is defined.  Thus, Apache leaks a bit of memory whenever use lock functions.  I think pthread_mutex_destroy must be called in lock_intra_cleanup@apr/locks/unix/intraproc.c and lock_cleanup@apr/locks/unix/crossproc.c (or more).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
add pthread_mutex_destroy() to lock functions.
