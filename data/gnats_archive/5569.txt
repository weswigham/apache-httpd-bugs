Any environment, presumably, where "ApJServManual off" is set.
>Description:
Using bindaddress to set an IP for JServ to use on a machine with multiple IP addresses works as long as JServ is started manually. If it's started automagically by apache, the jserv_wrapper ignores the bindaddress (or ApJServDefaultHost) and looks for jserv to be runnig on localhost. Since jserv isn't running on localhost, this fails.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
in src/c/jserv_wrapper.c, the following lines:

        /* Host is LOCALHOST (jserv is started here) */ 
        wrapper_data->config->host=ap_pstrdup(wrapper_pool,"localhost");

can be changed to:

        wrapper_data->config->host=ap_pstrdup(wrapper_pool,cfg->host);

I don't know if that's the right way to fix it, but it works for me.
