 Hi,
 
 I work with Apache-mod_jk-Tomcat combination & all requests to Tomcat goes
 through Apache.
 The problem: If my URL contains special characters, (e.g. '&', '+', etc.),
 browser escapes them by converting them to their hex characters. But, Apache
 unescapes them & thus my Tomcat server doesn't receive escaped characters.
 This is wrong. Apache shouldn't do any processing on URLs if those URLs are
 to be served by another server.
