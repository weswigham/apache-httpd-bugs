>Description:
The apachectl and apxs scripts contain incorrect paths when using a custom

layout.  Suppose the layout includes:



    sbindir: /funky/path/to/sbindir

    installbuilddir: /another/funky/path/to/build

    runtimedir: /yet/another/funky/path/to/runtimedir



Then apachectl will still look for $prefix/bin/httpd and apxs will still look

for the Apache build files in $prefix/build.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Apply the patch at ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/incoming/jlam/apache.diff to the

current httpd-2.0 sources (2002-03-05) and move the following files:



    support/apachectl.in --> support/apachectl.sh.in

    support/apxs.in --> support/apxs.pl.in

    support/dbmmanage.in --> support/dbmmanage.pl.in



The patch adds rules to create the scripts from the *.sh and *.pl files, and

adds logic to rules.mk to install scripts as part of local-install.



These changes based on the patches in the NetBSD Packages Collection.
