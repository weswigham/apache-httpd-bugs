regarding PR#2175

Hello,

I've got some more info regarding PR #2175.

It appears the problem goes is linked to mod_rewrite. Turning the
RewriteEngine off, makes the problem go away. 

That's why it did not appear with 1.3b3 : I had no mod_rewrite for 1.3b3.

I checked with 1.3b3, 1.3b5, 1.3b6, 1.3b7-dev(980508) : no problems with
'RewriteEngine Off'

Putting RewriteLogLevel to 0 also "solves" the problem. Maybe the threads
are fighting for the rewritelog filehandle?


So I guess to should move categories to mod_rewrite?

Priority could be dropped to non-critical I guess.
