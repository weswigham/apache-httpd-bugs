>Description:
I have read through the ticket database and the documentation and this simply
doesn't work correctly as far as I can tell.

The previous ticket(s) indicated the same problems/symptoms as I'm seeing here,
except he forgot the NameVirtualHost definition, etc.

I have a domain name (name only) VirtualHost that I need to define, which
was working on 1.2.x.  NameVirtualHost 111.222.333.44 is placed at the top of
the httpd.conf file.  The following definition is used for the virtual
hosting:


<VirtualHost 111.222.333.44>
    ServerAdmin email@address.com
    ServerName virtual.host.com
    DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/share/virtualhost/htdocs
    ErrorLog /usr/local/apache/share/virtualhost/logs/error.log
    TransferLog /usr/local/apache/share/virtualhost/logs/access.log
    UserDir /usr/local/apache/share/virtualhost/local
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.php3
    FancyIndexing ON
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache/share/virtualhost/cgi-bin/
    Alias /icons/ /usr/local/apache/share/virtualhost/icons/
</VirtualHost>

I've also tried inserting ServerAlias, which did not work.

This is following the directions.  Is this a known bug?

 The server will assume the identity of the VirtualHost definition,
 completely ignoring all the other
 directives in srm.conf, etc.
 
 I didn't give you host names because the site is generally unavailable for
 access, so it wouldn't
 do much good.  I can tell you what is in the configuration, which I did.

 You mean the main server isn't used for an IP designated as a
 namevirtualhost?
 
 That is explicitly spelled out in the documentation.

 You really aren't indiciating much to me.  You won't give names, you won't
 give examples of what you try to access, what you get, and what you think
 you get.  
 
 It is rather impossible to debug this sort of thing without knowing what
 you are trying to do.

 So you have one and only one virtualhost in your configuration?
 
 As documented, if you have one virtualhost and a NameVirtualHost directive
 for that IP that virtualhost will get _all_ connections to that IP.  
 
 Yet you say that isn't what you are seeing, yet you also say that "the
 server will assume the identity of the virtualhost directive".  I don't
 see how those two things can fit.
 
 When you access the virtualhost, what do you get?
 
 When you access the "main server" what do you get?
 
 Give a full list of all the cases where you think the site you try to
 access and the site you get are different.
 
 Life is far easier if you can just give real names, and say "I try to
 access http://foo/ and get my config for bar, etc."  It doesn't matter if
 the names or IPs can't be reached from the world.

 Sigh.  No, according to what you are now telling me, the main server 
 isn't being used at all for an IP designated as a NameVirtualHost.
 This is the exact thing you told me you _weren't_ seeing, but that is
 exactly what you are seeing.
 
 And, as I have said three times now, it is supposed to work that way.
 Please go through the docs and examples again.  If you specify a 
 NameVirtualHost directive then THE MAIN SERVER CONFIGURATION ISN'T
 USED, ONLY VIRTUALHOSTS ARE USED FOR THAT IP.

 If anyone else wants to try to explain to him that if you have a
 NameVirtualHost then name based vhosts work and the main server doesn't
 and if you don't then name based vhosts work, please go right ahead.

 I did exactly that before contacting you.  I tried with and without.  Same
 behavior.

 Alright, I think I figured out this problem.
 
 I added a VirtualHost for the local (main) machine and was able to get both
 pages to work.
 
 I have to disagree in that the documentation is vague and does not really
 indicate this.
 Some of the english is also a little bad, which makes it difficult to
 follow sometimes.
 
 Thanks,
 
 
 Forrest
