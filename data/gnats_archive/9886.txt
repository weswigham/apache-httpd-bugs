>Description:
I realize that this has been mentioned before, but I am not sure it has been submitted against 2.0.32.  If you run configure with --sysconfdir=/anything, httpd looks for httpd.conf in /anything/conf, instead of /anything
>How-To-Repeat:
Download httpd-2.0.32-beta.tar.gz, tar -xzf, ./configure --sysconfdir=/anything.  If you then ./httpd, you get "httpd: could not open document config file /opt/apache/conf/httpd.conf"
