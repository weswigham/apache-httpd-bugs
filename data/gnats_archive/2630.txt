>Description:
Downloaded .rm files don't work because the file size after doing a
"save link as" (filename) is changed!  What could cause this?

I have double checked the filesizes on the disk...and they are correct

When I use the same client and download from an NT web server (using
"Save link as" (filename) - the file size is correct.

Everything else on the web server seems to be "okay"

This is the only error I have noticed.

See "repeat this problem" section- to go to the URL's for the two web servers
that I have extensively tested this on.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://endeavour.valdosta.edu/kellie/rm.html is an apache server
http://cg.valdosta.edu/kellie/rm.html is an NT web server (it doesn't change size of file on download)

State-Changed-Why:
You have your server configured to serve .rm files
as text/plain.  Many clients will be confused by that.
Please add whatever MIME type is appropriate to your mime.types
file or to your config files with an AddType directive and
see if that helps.

If not, then please apply the latest Solaris patch cluster
available from Sun.

 I added:
 
 audio/x-pn-realaudio            rm
 
 to the mime.types and mime.types.default (then restarted Apache) and that
 fixed the "problem"
 
 Many thanks!
