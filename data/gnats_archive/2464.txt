>Environment:
Digital Unix V4.0/564
egcs-1.0.3 compiler
>Description:
Netscape 4.05, GNU wget 1.4.3, lynx 2.81dev5 all include the "Date:" HTTP
header field in files downloaded using an ftp:// URL, thus corrupting it.
Apparently this is due to an empty line between Content-Length: and Date:.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download any file using Apache 1.3.0 as an ftp-over-http proxy. Tested with
the URL ftp://ftp.univie.ac.at/packages/gnu/wget-1.5.1.tar.gz
>Fix:
No. I'm not sure where the Date: header is created.

 Update: bug is caused by a newline in the hdr_entry.value for the
 Content-Length header field (i.e. the value contains the numerical
 value with a surplus trailing newline). Around line 937 in
 src/modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c, this code propagates the trailing
 newline to the "size" variable (from ftp_getrc_msg), which is later
 copied to the header value field:
 			else if (i == 213) { /* Size command ok */
 							size = resp;
 
 Quick & dirty fix:
 Add:
 if (size[strlen(size)-1]=='\n') size[strlen(size)-1]='\0';
 (at the following line).
