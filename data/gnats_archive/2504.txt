HPUX-10.20 implementing apache_1.3 using the provided binary apache.
>Description:
Hi,

It seems that the httpd file was not generated in the binary directory for
HPUX-10.20. Please untar the hpux apache1.26 file to verify that, what I'm getting is httpd.conf 
only. I would appreciate a response.

Thanks
>How-To-Repeat:
From your download site,go to binaries, go to hpux 10.20,then download apache_1.2.5-9000_777..
then untar it. after it extracted I'm getting httpd.conf only !!!.

State-Changed-Why:
The binary is in the 1.2.5 file your refer to
in apache_1.2.5/src/httpd-9000_777-hp-hpux10.

It is not a 1.3 binary, so I'm not sure why you are
talking about 1.3.  If there is no 1.3 binary on the site
for HPUX, there is none available at this time.

 Hi marc,
  Thank you for your response. I may referenced to 1.3 by mistake. I 
 meant in 1.2.5 I'm not able to loacat the httpd file under /src. Even 
 though in the documentation  refers to it. 
 
 thanks 
 
 Hazem.
