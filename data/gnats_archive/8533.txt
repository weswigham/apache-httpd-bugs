WIN2Ksp2, MSVC++6sp5, updated from public cvs 2001-10-13 ~11pm
>Description:
resolve_symlink is returning the same info in the output stat as input since fillin_fileinfo says that the win2k symlink is APR_LNK

this is because of a recent change since it was working a week ago, in error.log: "symlink doesn't point to a file or directory: C:/dev"

i'm not so familiar with apache so not sure if my conf is okay, but it's the default conf that was installed (installd INSTDIR=...), sorry if my ignorance

>How-To-Repeat:
install on a win2k reparse point (disk mount): e.g. "c:\dev\apache2" where "c:\dev" is really d: mounted
>Fix:
no, sorry. is a win2k reparse point really analagous to a symlink? isn't it more similar to a unix mount point? i.e. should it stat to APR_LNK? well not exactly since it can also point to a file. i guess resolve_symlink should really resolve it?
