>Environment:
WinNT-4.0 With DevStudio-5.0
>Description:
The NT makefiles list odbc.lib and odbcc32.lib as libraries that need
linked in but they are not needed.  This causes me a problem because
I have to changed all of the Makefiles because I do not have those libraries
installed on my machine.  A general problem is that links take longer
because the linker is having to read in libraries that are not used.
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove the odbc*.lib libraries from the Developer Studio instalation.
>Fix:
Remove odbc.lib and odbcc32.lib from the makefiles

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, this is something we intended to do before the release
but it was overlooked. It will be done for the next
beta. I'm putting this PR into suspended status so we won't
forget this time.
