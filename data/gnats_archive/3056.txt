>Release:        1.3.2
>Environment:
Windows 98, using the Apache 1.3.2 binary for Win32.
>Description:
The error occurs close to the end of the function ap_proxy_send_fb.  When a send failure occurs, and the proxy decides to abort the send, it calls ap_pclosef(c->req->pool, c->fp->fd) but at this point, c->fp is null, so we get an access violation. This happens whether or not you have caching turned on.  
>How-To-Repeat:
LoadModule the proxy and then browse through the proxy, making sure to press stop a lot and to click on links very quickly, without giving the current page time to load in completely.  I found that doing this with Netscape 4.04 at www.cnn.com or www.w3.org produced the error within the first 3 or 4 minutes of browsing. This behaviour is very consistent.
