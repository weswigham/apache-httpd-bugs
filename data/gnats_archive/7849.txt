>Environment:
HP-UX 11.0 Apache 1.3.20 in combination with 
Windows NT 4.0 sp6a using IIS 4.0 (incl. patch concerning Web Server Folder Traversal Vulnerability, Q276489 at MicroSoft)
>Description:
We use Apache as Webserver and Proxy Server directives to IIS4.0 for certain applications. It all worked until I upgraded an NT server with a patch for vulnerabiltiy issue. Suddenly the URL's using underscores return "Error 400 ... Malformed request". Did test the following:

- Use the direct URL to server --- everything worked.
- Use another proxy to non-upgraded NT webserver --- everything worked.
- Upgraded from Apache 1.3.12 to 1.3.20 --- same results.

My question is: Are there any known issues about this behaviour when you use Apache (mod_proxy) proxying to Windows IIS4.0 at a certain patchlevel and if so, how can we solve this problem?
