FreeBSD lillebror.skriver.dk 2.2.6-STABLE FreeBSD 2.2.6-STABLE #0: Tue Jul  7 16:30:48 CEST 1998     root@lillebror.skriver.dk:/usr/src/sys/compile/LILLEBROR  i386
>Description:
I have a working installation of 1.3.1 (and php-3.0.2a) without any 
virtualhost directives, and Document root is /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs/ 
as expected, then I add the following virtualhost directive:

<VirtualHost www.dk.freebsd.org>
DocumentRoot /export/www
ServerName www.dk.freebsd.org
ErrorLog /var/log/httpd_www.dk.freebsd.org_error
TransferLog /var/log/httpd_www.dk.freebsd.org_access
</VirtualHost>

And now all requests goes to the FreeBSD mirror page, regardsless of the
page requested is http://lillebror.skriver.dk/ og http://www.dk.freebsd.org/

I've tried almost anything, so at last I went back to 1.2.4, and here it works
with the same VirtualHost directive.

The same problem as reported in problem report 2697, but you gave no solution,
just said it was a user mistake, but please elaborate !!
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the configs available at http://lillebror.skriver.dk/ with Apache 1.3.1
>Fix:
Works with 1.2.4, but I would like to use 1.3.x with PHP3 ... I'll now try 1.3.0
