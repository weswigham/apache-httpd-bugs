I have a:
ProxyPass /ftp/ ftp://ftp.wilshire.com/

>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, this site is behind a firewall.  But it looks like it is pretty generic.
>Fix:
proxy_ftp.c gets the host from the parsed_uri, whereas proxy_http.c gets it from url. I haven't tried it, but porting the logic from proxy_http.c to proxy_ftp.c looks like a winner.
