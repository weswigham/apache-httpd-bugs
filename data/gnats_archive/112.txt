Linux 2.0.24, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
When suexec is used to restrict/permit virtual servers to execute CGI as a particular user/group, the server won't permit "global" CGIs to execute.  This is undesireable because on a system where there are numerous virtual servers supported, it is a waste of resources to have to maintain independant sets of system CGIs.

The reason this problem occurs is because system CGIs are generally owned by root or by another special user, and suexec will not execute them as the user/group specified for a particular virtual server.  In this, suexec is correct, executing such could be considered a security problem.

Rather, it would seem more desirable to be able to configure mod_cgi so that one (or more) "safe" directory trees are established wherein suexec is bypassed, regardless of the virtuality of the server.  Thus, CGIs in said directory(ies) would be executed as per normal (on a system without suexec); as a safe non-root user.  Below is a patch I wrote to accomplish this.  It isn't done in the most desireable way; it only permits a single directory tree to contain global CGIs and it requires hand modification of httpd.h.  If the patch below is needed by anyone in it's raw format, it can be retrieved from: ftp://ftp.evcom.net/pub/linux/apache_1.2b4.patch
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a virtual server, use User/Group directives in httpd.conf for the server, and enable suexec.

Attempt to access any global CGI script on the system, such as:

http://www.virtualserver.com/cgi-bin/test-cgi

(assuming cgi-bin is ScriptAliased globally)

State-Changed-Why:
This is the intended behaviour.  If you want globally
ScriptAlias-ed scripts to be processed in the global
environment (i.e., not under the per-vhost User and
suexec environment), you need to include the correct
hostname in the CGI URL.  You might consider using
mod_rewrite and adding a rewrite rule in your vhost
sections that redirects http://vhost/cgi-bin/* to
http://mainhost/cgi-bin/* - I think that would result
in the effect you want.

If you don't want to do this, then you must make your
global CGI scripts runnable under the per-vhost User
and suexec environment.

Please let us know if the rewrite option solves your issue.
