State-Changed-Why:
Erm... obviously there must be something more to it than
just installing it and running it, otherwise we would have
noticed that little detail.  You are the first person complaining
of this.

How are you starting Apache?  Are you sure you didn't mess
with anything after you installed it?  Do you have a different
box you can try it on?  Are you sure you don't have an
old version of Apache around as well?

State-Changed-Why:
No response since JUly, and the problem sounds like an
old version of APache was still around, and the new install
was finding the old install's DLL's.
User: If you are still having this problem then please remobve
as remnants of previous installs and install 1.3.3
Thanks for using APache.
