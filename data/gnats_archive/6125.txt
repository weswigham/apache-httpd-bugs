>Description:
The loading DSO fails when server directory differs from one where Apache installed.
Suppose Apache installed in c:/program files/apache group/apache so the modules in
c:/program files/apache group/apache/modules. Then I installed my service
Apache.exe -i -n "MyServer" -d "c:/my_server". In this case if I place into httpd.conf
any LoadModule directive it couldn't be done because of Apache loads DSO dll-file
as c:/my_server/modules/mod_xxxx.dll in place of 
c:/program files/apache group/apache/modulesmod_xxxx.dll
>How-To-Repeat:
Do as I've written in description
>Fix:
The only way is to use Registry database where you have to save information of installed Apache location and use it information when loading modeles.

Erm... I'm not sure I understand.  Exactly what LoadModule
directive are you using that doesn't work?  Obviously, if you want
to load them from somewhere else you need to change the path
in your directive...

 Please go read the docs for LoadModule.

 If you want it to load it from a particular path, you have to specify the
 path!  If you do not want them loaded from a path relative to the
 ServerRoot, then of course you have to use a full path.
 
 There is no need for any registry mumbo jumbo, that is what the config
 file is for.  Use it.
