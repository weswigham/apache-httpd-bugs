The problem: I can't easily find the rule that caused this.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an .htaccess file that denies access to a file.
Hide it in the directory tree leading up to the file.
Try and find it.
>Fix:
New error message: 
 "...reason: Directory index forbidden by rule /home/firewall/.htaccess line 7"

While reading config files, .htaccess files and whatnot, record the filename
and line number.  When a rule is violated, log which rule.

For extra credit, create a command line debug flag that logs the rules used
for each request, or the first 10 requests, or the first request that matches
a regex.

For extra-extra credit, allow debugging of a cgi program with strace, running
strace only once for the given cgi.

Thanks!
