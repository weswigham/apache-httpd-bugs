Redhat Linux - all versions from 5.2 to 6.2
>Description:
When i specify ./configure --activate-module=src/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c
and do make, it fails when make try to make mod_proxy.
The problem is in Makefile in proxy directory.
LIBEXT=c not working.
Here must be LIBEXT=a.
With this and after make everything working good.
