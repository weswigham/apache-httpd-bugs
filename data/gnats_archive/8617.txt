>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Win2k 5.00.2195 SP2
>Description:
When the msbb.exe process is installed on the machine the apache webserver will not behave correctly at startup.  I must stop the srvice and restart for it to work.  I believe that this is installed whenever AOL instant messenger is installed as well as with other pieces of software.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download the msbb.exe program which is a spy program used to track your internet visits.  If you ask me it is nothing more than commercialized virus.  It is installed in the registry as msbb or n-case or 180solutions.
>Fix:
Remove any trace of msbb.exe from hardrive and from registry.  Also delete anything in registry with n-case and 180solutions keys.
