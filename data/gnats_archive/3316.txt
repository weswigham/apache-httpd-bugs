SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
>Description:
DOC_ROOT and LOG_EXEC are both set in the Makefile that is
generated after a configure. However, neither of these variables
can be set with an option to configure.

The suexec.h file options are therefore overridden and the
following lines are therefore ignored:

#ifndef DOC_ROOT
#define DOC_ROOT "/www"       /* Need me? */
#endif

(the same for LOG_EXEC)

A template is kept (on our site) for suexec.h which is copied
into the src/support directory before compilation (after a diff
with the new version of course :-) and we initially had a problem
figuring out what was wrong.
>How-To-Repeat:
-
>Fix:
Add the following options to configure:

  --suexec-docroot
  --suexec-logexec

State-Changed-Why:

Two new options (--suexec-docroot and --suexec-logfile)
have been added to APACI to allow full control of      
the suEXEC setup.
