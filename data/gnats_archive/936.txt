>Environment:
IRIX fire 5.3 11091812 IP22 mips
gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
fire 142# /usr/local/encap/Apache-1.2.1.bak/etc/Apache/httpd -f /usr/local/encap
/Apache-1.2.1.bak/etc/Apache/conf/httpd.conf
open: No such file or directory
Cannot open lock file: /usr/local/etc/Apache/logs/accept.lock.20502

fire 143# grep logs /usr/local/encap/Apache-1.2.1.bak/etc/Apache/conf/httpd.conf

ErrorLog /var/Apache/logs/error_log
TransferLog /var/Apache/logs/access_log
PidFile /var/Apache/logs/httpd.pid
ScoreBoardFile /var/Apache/logs/apache_status
>How-To-Repeat:
dunno, but it wasn't a problem in 1.2b7 (which is what I'm upgrading from).
>Fix:
include a directive in httpd.conf for the LockFile rather than forcing me to
use the default

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Jul 29 15:04:57 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Use the LockFile directive.  This is documented and there
are other PRs in the database about it that a search
should find.  A quick scan of the CHANGES file would have
made it pop up.
