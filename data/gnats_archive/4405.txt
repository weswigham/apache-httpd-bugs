Win32, Linux, FreeBSD
>Description:
Assume the follow files:
----index.html----
index1
<!--#include file="body.html" -->
index2
----body.html------
body1
<!--#include file="part1.html" -->
body2
<!--#include file="part2.html" -->
body3
----part1.html-----
part1
----part2.html-----
part2
-------------------------------
The resulting output is: index1 body1 part1 index2
The resulting output should be: index1 body1 part1 body2 part2 body3 index2
The error log says: premature EOF in parsed file /path/to/body.html
In some cases when I try this, I get spurious html 
in the page at the end of body1 which overwrites index2 (not as reproducible).

>How-To-Repeat:
Try making the pages describes above.
>Fix:
Check the page buffering code in ssi. (just a guess)
The page mangling makes me think there is buffer overflow 
exploit here, but I am not sufficiently an expert in this area to know 
how to exploit it.
