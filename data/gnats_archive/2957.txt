>Description:
I ran into a situation today with Apache that I'm 99% sure is a bug.
I'm not sure WHICH part of it is the bug though, since the documentation
is a bit unclear.

Consider the following httpd.conf snippet:

<DirectoryMatch ^/opt/web/.*/docroot>
Options FollowSymLinks Includes
AllowOverride None
order allow,deny
allow from all
</DirectoryMatch>

<Directory /opt/web/mpath/docroot/foundation/partners/docs>
AuthType basic
AuthName "Documentation"
AuthUserFile /opt/web/mpath/private/developers.pw
AuthGroupFile /opt/web/mpath/private/developers.group
<Limit GET POST PUT>
satisfy any
order deny,allow
deny from all</Limit>
</Directory>

Yes yes yes, I know "FollowSymLinks" won't work in a DirectoryMatch directive,
I already logged that as a bug. :) But the problem I'm having is follows:

In the situation above, the directory
/opt/web/mpath/docroot/foundation/partners/docs (Henceforth referred to as
'docs') has no authentication required for it at all. Despite the allow
from .mpath.com and require group developers, it does not in fact require
either. The two fixes are to A) Fix the DirectoryMatch directive so it
matches on  ^/opt/web/.*/docroot$, or remove the 'satisfy any' directive.

Here're what I think are either bugs, or confusing:

1) It should be specified in the documentation that the DirectoryMatch is
not an absolute match, but a partial like grep or sed. This is the least
of my concerns, as anyone with regexp experience would probably assume this
anyway.

2) What I think is breaking here is this: Directory directives are
matched prior to DirectoryMatch directives. Which means the
DirectoryMatch section is superseding the Directory section in
deciding what sort of authentication is required. But the removal of
the 'satisfy any' directive should NOT then result in authentication
being on the directory, instead the rules of precedence should be the
same, and there should be no permissions on the directory. Instead what
is occuring is removal of the satisfy any directive triggers the
implicit satisfy all, and suddenly there IS permissions on directory.

Whew. This took forever to track down.

>How-To-Repeat:
Use entries in the httpd.conf file similar to the snippet above.
>Fix:
With GOOD CODERS! Which luckily the Apache group has in abundant supply. :)

State-Changed-Why:

What you describe is no bug, but simply the way things
are supposed to work.

The document at http://www.apache.org/docs/sections.html
should help you to understand the interaction of
<Directory> and <DirectoryMatch>.
