Windows 98 SE
Apache 1.3.9
>Description:
I was running Apache 1.3.6 under Windows 98 SE and everything was working just
fine, after upgrading to 1.3.9 however (the newest Apache release for Win32) it did not display SHTML files correctly anymore. 

The configuration was exactly the same and the environment did not change at all. Apache seemed to have problems executing the program in the #EXEC tag ... the browser output was a white window ... or a timeout ... in rare cases it did work after long minutes of waiting, but it did not seem to have a pattern...

I uninstalled 1.3.9 and installed 1.3.6 again and it worked correctly once again without any troubles ... again, the configuration (httpd.conf) was not changed and the environment the same as well ...

Does anyone else have this problem?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Perhaps it is the way Apache executes the programs now in an own child process...

State-Changed-Why:
I think this is a variation of a bug already reported and fixed in Apache 1.3.10 due out later this month.
