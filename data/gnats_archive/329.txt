Linux, Kernel 2.0.19. GCC 2.7.1
>Description:
When a cgi-script want to print itself his own header (for sending a 
redirection to the browser for example), he should print the line :
Status: 302 but instead a status of 200 is checked !
(The comments in the codes and the doc say that the script should use a
status of 302).

else if (location && r->status == 200) {
    /* XX Note that if a script wants to produce its own Redirect
     * body, it now has to explicitly *say* "Status: 302"
     */
     return REDIRECT;
}
>How-To-Repeat:
Use your sample script from the how-to doc for redirecting a URL by
using a cgi-script. :)
>Fix:
Choose if it shoudl be a status of 200 or 302 and either change the example/comments
or change the test in mod_cgi.c

State-Changed-Why:
Can you explain this in more detail?If the redirect script returns a 200 status, Apache will use itsown set of headers and response body. If the script returns another status,the script can output its own headers and response body (ofcourse, if the script issues a 301 or 302, it should includea Location: header).This appears to work with the script in the How do I? docs.(Try changing the Status: to 200).

State-Changed-Why:
The test for 200 is for special handling, so that it can be
converted to a 302.  A CGI can quite easily issue "Status: 302"
and the server will pipe it back to the client, that code isn't
needed.
