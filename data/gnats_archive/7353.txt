Whatever
>Description:
If a CGI emits a Location:-header on stdout, apache apparently guesses that
this particular program must have finished its work (at least without
persistent connections) and will exit as soon as possible, thereby in turn
terminating the program, which might or might not have had enough time
to dissassociate itself (fork()/ setsid()) from the running httpd-instance.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
- wait at least until std(in|out|err) are explicitly closed
- document it

State-Changed-Why:

I'm not an expert in this (you should check one of the
CGI FAQs for details), but I believe the correct way
to handle this situation is to fork a subprocess from
your CGI before you send the Location: header,
and make sure to close stdin/stdout/etc on the
forked process.  Apache can't count on CGI processes
cleaning up after themselves.

Thanks for using Apache!
