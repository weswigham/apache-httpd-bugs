>Description:
When I try to execute perl file from my browser.
It gives an error to contact administrator. 
I looked at the error log file as below:
[Wed Mar 22 14:30:39 2000] [error] [client 198.135.51.237] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: c:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/email.pl
The perl program resides in that place, Is it possible that spaces in the direc
tory listing is causing the problem. How can I remove the space.
I tried changing the httpd.conf directory to c:/progra~1/apache~1/apache
in the necessary files. This one, I am not able to get the successful installation message of the Apache server.
So please help and email me at srinivenkatesan@hotmail.com
