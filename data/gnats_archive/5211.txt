>Description:
Parameters names/values are stored in an Hashtable named params inside the JServConnection class.
Some web servers and CGI scripts require parameters to be posted in the same order they appear in the HTML page.
When calling getParametersNames() and getParametersValues(), JServ should return them in the order they appear in the HTML page from which the POST originated.
>How-To-Repeat:
Easy to reproduce:
<form method=POST action=/bin/MyServlet>
<input type=hidden name="param1" value="myvalue1">
<input type=hidden name="param2" value="myvalue2">
... (add as many parameters as you want)
</form>


And in the servlet
Enumeration e=req.getParameterNames()

While (e.hasMoreElements())
 out.println(e.nextElement());

Parameters Names will not be returned in the correct order.
>Fix:
Change the Hashtable where params are stored by an OrderedHashtable. 
Forget about the javax.servlet.HttpUtil class :
postParameters = HttpUtils.parsePostData(getContentLength(), is);

Free implementations of an OrderedHashtable (which should extend Hashtable for compatibility with JSDK) are available on the net.

 No. There is nothing in the spec that says that these parameters should be
 in any sort of order. CGI scripts that expect them to be in order are coded
 incorrectly IMHO.
