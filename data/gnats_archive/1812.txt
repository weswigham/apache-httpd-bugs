>Description:
While make'ing, compiler returns error

mod_auth.o: In function 'authenticate_basic_user':
mod_auth.o (.text+0x349): undefined reference to 'crypt'
make: *** [httpd] Error 1

Apache does not finish compiling.  I have had and run Apache 1.1.3 - 1.2.4 with Red Hat 4.1/4.2 with no problems.  Could this be a glibc incompatibility??
