>Description:
with the directive:
Scriptlog logs/scriptlog

in my httpd.conf, the file logs/scriptlog is never opened (the directory is
world-writable so it can't be a permission conflict).  ktracing the binary
shows that no open is ever done.  the scriptlog directive DOES show up in
the mod_info output though.

i tried running it under gdb with a breakpoint at log_scripterror but it never
stopped there.  that's about the limit of my debugging skills though.

 additional:
 
 ok, scriptlog is opened when mod_cgi hits an error (like, "file not
 found").  but printing to stderr in the cgi itself never works.  nothing
 gets written to any log.  if i take out scriptlog, printing to stderr
 goes to the ErrorLog as expected.

State-Changed-Why:

The script's stderr is only written to the ScriptLog file
if the script exits with a non-zero status.  If you want
your stderr output to be reported, you must signal the
server that the script has failed by exiting this way.
