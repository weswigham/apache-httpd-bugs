>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.13 SMP 
320M SDRAM 512M swap (0 is used)
>Description:
When started, httpd uses 43M.   I have apache reload once every 30 minutes due to a automation system that we have in place.  Every time apache reloads, more memory is consumed.  In a 8 hour timespan, httpd goes from 43M to 230M !  Should I not reload apache every 30 mins, it stays at around 43M forever (as it should).

I have 950 VirtualHosts.  

root@ns2:/weblogs > httpd -l
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_setenvif.c
  mod_php3.c  

0 modules via ../modules

Severity listed as critical because Apache consumes all resources in under 24 hours causing havok.
>How-To-Repeat:
Duplicate my enviroment.  The only mod I have added is mod_php3.c on 1.3.6. I have approx 950 virtual hosts on a dual 400mhz machine with 320M ram that sits around 99.9% CPU idle.  Reload your apache every 30 mins.. or heck just keep on reloading it.

Sorry no suggestions,.. I'm stumped.
