Win32 (windows 98)
>Description:
I installed :
Apache 1.3.22
Tomcat 4.0.1

And I configured Apache and Tomcat in order to they work together :
- Apache for classic web page
- Tomcat for JAVA application

The problem is quite basic : 
If a web page, serving by Tomcat passing by Apache have images, this one never be display and Tomcat crashed... Just serving a page with image.

>How-To-Repeat:
Install Tomcat, Apache and webapp module... I don't do anything else... I already saw this problem on other mailing list and bug report list but no solution is provided !

I use : http://www.galatea.com/flashguides/apache-tomcat-4-win32.xml to help to install and configure software.

Thanks for ur help and work !
