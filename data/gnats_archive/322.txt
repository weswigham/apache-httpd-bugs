Referer logging does the wrong thing.
Referer turned on with:
CustomLog logs/referer_log "%{Referer}i -> %U"

Yet some loads produce lines like:
http://www.resort.com/services.html -> /wotd.html
http://www.resort.com/services.html -> /images/wotd/0.gif
http://www.resort.com/services.html -> /images/wotd/6.gif

Where the bitmaps were loaded from wotd.html and certainly not
from services.html
>How-To-Repeat:
Uncertain -- does CustomLog logs/referer_log "%{Referer}i -> %U"
actually do refers correctly?  Why isn't this desirable example in
the docs?

 Can you reproduce the problems on demand?  If so, there are a few more
 tests we can do.  If not, can you try adding a log of the User-agent to
 the referrer log so we can see if it is just one client that is doing it. 
 If so, it is likely a client error. 
 
 The server will listen to whatever the client says so if the client is
 giving the server incorrect information there isn't anything the server
 can do about it.  It is possible that it is an Apache bug, but I would be
 inclined to mistrust the client first.
 
 The way you are specifying your referer log looks fine.  You may also want
 to try the (somewhat obsolete) mod_log_referer module to see if it logs
 the same thing.

 I have this compiled in presently and will inform if it produces similar
 results.  I will also try dumping the client ident to see if theres a
 particular client responsible.

 Based one 2 days worth of user agent dumps, I would close this bug
 as a client issue.  The AOL-IWENG 3.0 and 3.1 clients sometimes fail
 to set the referer.  All others appear fine.
 
 Bad AOL.  Let me know if you need any more information.
