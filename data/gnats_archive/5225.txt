>Description:
Unexpectedly, Apache children will all go away.  The main process does not start new ones and this is in the error log:

[Sun Oct 31 01:20:09 1999] [warn] child process 15743 did not exit, sending another SIGHUP

[Sun Oct 31 01:20:11 1999] [warn] child process 15780 did not exit, sending another SIGHUP
[Sun Oct 31 01:20:11 1999] [warn] child process 15781 did not exit, sending another SIGHUP
[Sun Oct 31 01:20:33 1999] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
[Sun Oct 31 01:21:02 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 configured -- resuming normal operations

However, normal operations are not resumed.  There are no child processes.  apahcectl graceful and restart do not help.  The create new lines in the error log like:

[Sun Oct 31 01:47:53 1999] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
[Sun Oct 31 01:48:16 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 configured -- resuming normal operations

However, no childs exist.  The only resolution is to apachectl stop and then apachectl start.
>How-To-Repeat:
It only seems to happen when another process is not working.  The first time it happened, we simply had a cron job that sent a bad param to ps.  Everytime that job ran, this would happen.  This last time our MySQL process had spiked.  I have seen MySQL and other processes spike before on other OS'es and not seen this problem.

State-Changed-When: Sun Oct 31 07:17:24 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Are you using NFS at all on the system?

Do you have the latest Solaris patch cluster installed?

What does a truss on the parent show when it isn't working
right?  Of particular interest is what it does when you try
to 'apachectl restart'.

 I will have to wait for it to happen again.
