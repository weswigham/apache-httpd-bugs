i dont really know if this is a bug but it is a problem for me.

im using the latest version of apache (1.3.14 i think) and in the documentation and even in the httpd.conf file it tells oyu how to create name based visrtual hosts. i tried to create one and it didnt work.

whats the problem? here is a snippet from the bottom of httpd.conf:

NameVirtualHost 210.84.107.39

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for requests without a known
# server name.
<VirtualHost 210.84.107.39>
ServerName www.domain.tld
DocumentRoot /
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 210.84.107.39>
ServerName www.otherdomain.tld
DocumentRoot /www/otherdomain
</VirtualHost>

i just copied and pasted these examples from the documentation bu i have also treied other names

State-Changed-Why:

As the docs point out, you can't just make up names (or
addresses) and hope they work.  Please see
