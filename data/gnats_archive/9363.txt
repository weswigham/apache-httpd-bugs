>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
SunOS 5.6 on a Sparc Ultra 80 and Linux RedHat 6.2 on an Intel PC
>Description:
The 'Pragma: no-cache' fix (see PR #5668) doesn't take in consideration dynamic pages (such as JSPs or Servlets) which should not be cached by proxies but don't need to be delivered instantly. 
Apache 1.3.22 actual behaviour leads to an important overhead, for the HTTP Header is sent by mod_proxy in very small pieces (according to long running cgi-scripts and streaming servers needs).
As an exemple, our Apache 1.3.22 proxy sends, when 'Pragma: no-cache' is encountered, 36 small IP packets for the response instead of 1, which leads (with the 18 packets of TCP Acknowledgement) to an overhead of 2160 octets !
>How-To-Repeat:
Just put a 'Pragma: no-cache' directive in the HTTP Header of a response (using mod_headers for instance) and use a network sniffer to see the problem after this packet goes through an Apache 1.3.22 proxy.
>Fix:
A directive should be added to mod_proxy to determine if it should send HTTP response headers buffered or unbuffered. For instance 'ProxyResponseUnbuffered On/Off', with default set to Off.
The following patch for apache 1.3.22 adds this feature (the directive context is server config, virtual host, directory) :
