Machine: FreeBSD haeb.noc.easynet.net 3.0-RELEASE FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE #0: Sat Oct 17 17:45:06 GMT 1998     jkh@kickme.freebsd.org:/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC  i386
gcc: 2.7.2.1
No special patches that I know of.
>Description:
The package came from the 'ports' collection for FreeBSD.  No changes were made to it.
'make build' seemed to run correctly, as did 'make install'.  I then tried to
run the apache.sh to start it and got:
Syntax error on line 26 of /usr/local/etc/apache/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/libexec/apache/mod_mime_magic.so into server: /usr/local/libexec/apache/mod_mime_magic.so: Undefined symbol "ap_make_sub_pool"

>How-To-Repeat:
AFAIK just try and install and run it on FreeBSD 3
>Fix:
I am too new to the package to have any idea :-(

State-Changed-Why:
First, since this is the FreeBSD port having problems, you really
should try compiling a current version of it yourself before
submitting a bug report to us, since third party ports or packages
can do all sorts of things.

1.3.2 does not support dynamically loaded modules
on FreeBSD 3.  Either get a current version of the freebsd port
or wait for 1.3.4.

    Thanks for the prompt reply.  I have retrieved 1.3.3, and compiled
 it.  It works 'out-of-the-box', so all is now OK!
 
    Regards,
        Harry.
