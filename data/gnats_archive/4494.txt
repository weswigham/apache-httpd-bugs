Solaris 7 for Intel, Java 1.1, 
>Description:
I did not have m5, autoconf, aclocal on my machine and was unable to install JServ until I added them. Ideally, the configure script would give a warning if these aren't present.
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove above programs from your system. Configure will appear to do everything OK, but when you run make install there will be a problem
>Fix:
Have the configure script check for missing software.
