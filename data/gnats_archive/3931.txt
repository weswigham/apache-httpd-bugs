>How-To-Repeat:
I can everytime just send a kill -HUP 'cat apache.pid' after a few daysof running.
>Fix:
Nope, looking for a way. There has got to be something causing it between v1.3b5 and the newer versions.

State-Changed-Why:
To be honest, I suspect it's something you have compiled into
the server.

Or maybe it's the RAM in your box.

But nobody else seems to be having the same troubles... if
you get any more info, open a new PR please.  Sorry we
can't be of more help.
