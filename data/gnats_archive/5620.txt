Found on Linux 2.2.12 (RedHat 6.1), GCC 2.95, but also seen on Solaris 2.6 SPARC.
This is a platform independent bug.  mod_perl 1.21 installed on each, but the bug
isn't specific to mod_perl.
>Description:
I'm using mod_perl, and building a new authentication system.  I managed to make
a configuration that called the authz handler in mod_auth.c, but without setting
the user in the current connection data structure.  This caused a strcmp with a 
NULL value in mod_auth.c.  

The patch below performs an explicit check that user is set before making the comparison.

Yes, my mod_perl handlers were broken, but Apache shouldn't be dumping core in a case
like this either.
