Win95.  Base release 1.3b6. Installed from installer file.
>Description:
The win95 release of apache will ask for a login and password if
you place a .htaccess file in your desired directory.  That works
fine.  The problem is anyone can guess a filename contained within
the directory if they guess the filename like index.html for example.

So in short:
http://server.com/protected_dir/   will produce login and password window (works appropriatly)
http://server.com/protected_dir/guessedfilename.html   will load the file without asking for a password or login.

Is there any way to fix this? Please get back to me thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce on win95 (possibly NT as well)

http://server.com/protected_dir/   will produce login and password window (works appropriatly)
http://server.com/protected_dir/guessedfilename.html   will load the file without asking for a password or login.

 Erm... I can't reproduce that.  
 
 Are you _sure_ your authorization isn't being cached by your client?  If
 you exit the client then reload it, does it prompt for authorization for
 http://server.com/protected_dir/ ?  If you exit again and reload, does it
 prompt for authorization for
 http://server.com/protected_dir/guessedfilename.html
 
 Note that most clients cache the authorization until you exit them or, in
 the case of MSIE, they can do it forever.

 Yes I am sure because if you go directly to 
 http://server.com/protected_dir/guessedfilename.html and not 
 http://server.com/protected_dir/ first it won't prompt you for a 
 password box so therefore it couldn't have cached something I didn't 
 provide.  I am aware about browsers caching the passwords after u enter 
 it once though.  This is not the case.  Did you try it with win95 apache 
 or the one for unix?
 
 Thanks for the quick reply,
 JC

AgentZap is right, on Windows 95 the auth is ignored. I 
haven't tested this yet on Windows NT, I'll try that tonight.

 Did you find anything or come up with any reason as to why this is going 
 on? I just d/l 1.3b7 for win32 tonight and if I guess the filename it 
 still lets me in without prompt.  I am still using win95 and netscape 
 4.05.  (Yes just to make sure it isn't cached I clear the memory and 
 file cache then exit netscape and manually delete fat.db and relaunch 
 and try again- you can never be too safe heh).
 
 Thanks,
 AgentZap

 Nope, no one's had the time/resources to deal with it.  If it's still there
 over the next week we may officially disrecommend Win95 as a supported
 platform.
