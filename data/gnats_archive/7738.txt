>Environment:
Windows 2000 build 2195
using mod_FastCGI, 2.10.0 (I think I've ruled this out),
otherwise using Apache pre-built for Windows as is
>Description:
I moved my web directory to a server disk recently for reasons that shouldn't matter.  That is to say, I have a separate server box running Windows 2000 and I mounted a directory from that box on my local machine and put the web directory there.  All using standard Microsoft protocols.

My basic pages (served by a FastCGI process) were coming up but no images.  Apache kept instantiating multiple copies of my FastCGI process.  The error log kept saying:

  [Thu May 17 11:13:59 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
    (36)Resource deadlock avoided: mod_rewrite:
      failed to lock file descriptor

When I finally moved the mod_rewrite log to a directory on my local machine everything started working correctly.  All the other logs seem to work fine on the mounted drive.  I would guess that mod_rewrite doesn't use the same logging mechanism that Apache proper does.

Further testing shows that the problem is independent of FastCGI (though the error percolates, causing multiple copies of the FastCGI process, somehow).  In addition, it only happens when there are multiple images on the page.  A single image on a page works OK.  Simultaneous processing of multiple files?
>How-To-Repeat:
In a Windows environment, mount a drive from a remote machine (e.g. W: -> \\Nexus\Web).  Include the following in httpd.conf:

LoadModule  rewrite_module  modules/mod_rewrite.so

###########################################################################
<VirtualHost localhost>
#
  ServerName        localhost

  DocumentRoot      "W:/test"

  RewriteEngine     on
  RewriteLog		"W:/test/Rewrite.log"
  RewriteLogLevel   9
  
  RewriteRule		^/$						/mungo.html

  ErrorLog          "W:/test/Error.log"
  TransferLog       "W:/test/Transfer.log"
</VirtualHost>

###########################################################################

The file mungo.html is:

<html>
<head>
  <title>Test</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>&nbsp;Mungo!</h1>
  <img src='bullet1.gif'>
  <img src='bullet2.gif'>
  <img src='bullet3.gif'>
</body>
</html>

The files bullet?.gif are all the same -- I'm assuming that any image will do here.

When I run this test I get:

  [Thu May 17 12:48:40 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
    (36)Resource deadlock avoided: mod_rewrite:
      failed to lock file descriptor
  [Thu May 17 12:48:49 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
    (36)Resource deadlock avoided: mod_rewrite:
      failed to lock file descriptor

Note that the error and transfer logs work properly.

I have NOT tested this on any other platform.  I DID, however, rename my mod_FastCGI DLL so it couldn't be loaded even by accident, so I'm pretty sure it isn't a part of the problem.  Other than that I'm using the pre-built Windows distribution.
>Fix:
I'm guessing that the Apache internal API provides logging functionality and that mod_rewrite doesn't use it properly.  Or it could be that mod_rewrite is doing simultaneous processing without locks and that doesn't come up in Apache proper (seems unlikely).
