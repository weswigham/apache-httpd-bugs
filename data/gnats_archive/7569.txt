>Description:
At seemingly random intervals random binary garbage is appending between normal entries in error_log.  Less frequently a random web page is dumping to error_log.  Below is an example of this garbage.  This does not show up within the log file itself, but when the log is monitored with "tail -f" strings of "linuxlinuxlinuxlinuxlinuxlinuxlinuxlinuxlinuxlinux" are visible at the end of each block of garbage.  No other strange symptoms occuring on the server.  access_log seems normal.  Syslogs seem normal.

I am VERY confused.  This began only yesterday, and the error_log is quickly growing bigger than the access_log.  This is rather worrysome.

State-Changed-Why:
First, I have no idea who "nusphere" is, but note that we can not support third party modified versions of Apache since we have no idea what they did to them.  

A CGI can write anything it wants into the error log; make sure to double check any CGIs that you are running, especially any modified recently.
