>Environment:
Digital Unix 4.0E, Digital JVM 1.1.7B, mod_jserv 1.0b2
>Description:
I've written JNI code to access the Unix password database (getpwnam et al).  The code works fine from standalone code, but won't work from a servlet.  The error is:

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: getpwnam
        at org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.run(Compiled Code)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java)

I also found that I had to install the .so file in the system shared library directory otherwise System.loadLibrary() couldn't find it.  With standalone code it can find the .so in the current directory.  What is the cwd supposed to be when running a servlet?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I suspect that the JServ ClassLoader is to blame.  It looks as if the static invocation of System.loadLibrary() worked but the subsequent binding of the native methods failed.
