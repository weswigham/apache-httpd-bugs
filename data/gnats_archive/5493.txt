>Description:
I can't build Apache with mod_ssl.  I need SSLeay version 0.9.3 or newer.  I can
not find it.  The newest I could get is SSLeay 0.9.0b.  Does anyone know where
to get a newer version of SSLeay or which is the last version of Apache and 
mod_ssl that will work with SSLeay 0.9.0b?

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, we can't help you.  The SSL patches are not distributed
by us and we have nothing to do with them.  I'm sure the
mod_ssl web page at http://www.modssl.org/ can provide all the info you need.
