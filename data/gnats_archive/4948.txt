sun solaris, using Apache 1.3.9
>Description:
We are trying to use mod_mime_magic module so that we can associate a file 
with correct application irrespective of the file extension, we have to change
the file extension and append it with some version as shown below
e,g test.doc willl be stored test.doc@@V1.0, 
we want this file to be displayed
correctly as a word document, but with Netscape Navigator the file appears as
junk characters, same is the case with any Microsoft product e.g excel, powerpoint
etc, but PDF/HTML files with different extension seems to open correctly 
with netscape.
We require this to work as soon as possible as our project has to be deployed
soon it would be great if yopu could help me and provide with some solution
saying how to make it work with Netscape

Thanks
>How-To-Repeat:
you can go to
nscert.cig.mot.com:8080/testDocs and try accessing files with Netscape browser
i am using netscape version 4.6
