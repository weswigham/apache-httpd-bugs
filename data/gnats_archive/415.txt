Solaris-2.5.1 Sunsoft C Compiler
>Description:
Apache_1.2b8 appears to attempt a DNS lookup on any hostnames specified on
LHS of the ProxyRemote Directive, and fails to forward proxy requests if it
cannot resolve the name of the host.

e.g. ProxyRemote http://some.host.com/ http://123.456.789.012:8888/

Apache_1.2b7 and previous does not have this behaviour.


Background; I run a proxy server behind a firewall and do not have access to a
DNS to resolve the names of hosts on the other side of the firewall. However I
can (could) map the names of hosts to IP addresses using the ProxyRemote
directive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Reconfigure a machine without DNS and try using a ProxyRemote directive to 
map its name to an IP address.
>Fix:
Don't attempt DNS on the hostnames on the LHS of a ProxyRemote Directive%3

Named hosts for ProxyRemote can be accessed no other way.
