>Description:
Since I've upgraded to 1.2b10 a month ago, The problem has happened twice in the 
past week and a half. Lots of servers running, but no response from port 80 even
when I telnet to it. There are no unusual error logs either.

	The last time however, I noticed that the very last acces_log's were 
quite strange. All the machines listed are UNIX:

step unknown - [28/May/1997:13:20:19 -0400] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 3854
localhost unknown - [28/May/1997:13:20:20 -0400] "GET /externe HTTP/1.0" 301 184
step unknown - [28/May/1997:13:20:23 -0400] "GET /gestion/aep/bottin/bottin.htm HTTP/1.0" 200 2873
step unknown - [28/May/1997:13:20:24 -0400] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 3854
localhost unknown - [28/May/1997:13:20:25 -0400] "GET /externe HTTP/1.0" 301 184
crash.comic.polymtl.ca unknown - [28/May/1997:13:20:26 -0400] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 9531 

Of course the weird thing is that their user names were not listed as they should 
normally be. Also I've never seen "localhost" as opposed to "step" in the logs before.

	As soon as the server is killed and restarted, everything is OK.
Note that I did not change my config when I upgraded, I just replaced the "src/"
directory. ???

	Nothing unusual appeared in the syslog either, I did not have time 
to do a proper check with netstat however.

Ps : crash.comic is considered a safe host (ie no bad people!)

Does it still happen if you upgrade to 1.2.0 release?
