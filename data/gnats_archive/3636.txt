RedHat Linux 5.1 & 5.2
>Description:
I am attempting to set up apache on numberous servers.  I have setup three boxes two have redhat 5.1 and the third has
Redhat 5.2.  After installing the apache-1.3.3 rpm, I am unable to obtain access
to any of the user's "public_html" access.

here is what the error log states....
[Sat Jan  9 00:22:33 1999] created shared memory segment #640
[Sat Jan  9 00:22:34 1999] Server configured -- resuming normal operations

I attempted to user the older 1.2.6 rpm and recieved the same problem

I have copied configuration files off of other working Redhat server; however, this does 
not fix the problem?
>How-To-Repeat:
1.  Do a fresh install of Redhat linux
2.  Install rpm
3.  Immediately try to access http://localhost/~someuser
	where someuser has a viable public_html directory and some index.html file in it
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
Well, exactly what happens when you try?  What message do
you get in the client?

Are you sure that the directory and all parent directories
(including the user's home directory) are world readable?

 ok...I feel like an idiot now.  I made the bad assumption that Redhat
 Linux makes /home readable from the get-go.  
 
 Thanks for the help!
 
 Sincerely,
 Scott McDaniel
