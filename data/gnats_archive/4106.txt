>Unformatted:
This is a follow-up to a case I had opened a month or more
ago.

After investigating the problem with truss and guessing that
the problems were a result of bugs resulting from solaris
2.6 implementation of fstat64 and friends, I downgraded my
sparc station to Solaris 2.5.1 --and apache has since been
running like a champ with no trouble.

I maintain a second server on which I have applied the
Sun patches for solaris 2.6 and am watching it to see if the
patches overcome the nfs bugs that were biting apache --I'll
update this list when I discover something concrete.
 Thanks, 
 --Raman
