>Description:
I've tried to add separate cgi-bin directories with several ways, none have
worked and always give me:
[Mon Jun  9 00:42:57 1997] access to /var/httpd/cgi-bin/Normark/test.cgi failed for sentinel.surfen.net, reason: Premature end of script headers
I've read the FAQ about that, and even added what it said and still get that error.
The CGI scripts work fine under Netscape Enterprise server, and under the
"servers" cgi-bin directory.
I've tried the following:
<VirtualHost www.surfen.net>
DocumentRoot /var/httpd/Surfen
...
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /var/httpd/cgi-bin/Surfen
Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +Includes #+ExecCGI
</VirtualHost>

and the same as above but instead of ScriptAlias, just Alias
and:
<Directory /var/httpd/cgi-bin/Surfen/>
Options +ExecCGI
</Directory>

None of this works of course and I'm really getting frustrated with it.

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin

State-Changed-Why:
This is probably not a bug in Apache, but simply errors in
your CGI scripts.  Show me what you are trying to use as
a CGI script.  Try the test-cgi one that comes with Apache.
ScriptAlias works just fine; this would really be more
appropriately asked on comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.
