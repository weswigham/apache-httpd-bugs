>Description:
I have already posted this problem to mod_ssl bug report pages, but there was no response for 7 days and I also think that such a problem will occur with any module, which has a bit longer startup, and is therefore more general and not related only to mod_ssl. So I decided to put it here. Any help would be very appreciated.

There is a problem if we start Apache 1.3.20 (with modssl-2.8.4-1.3.20) as a Windows service when using "SSLPassPhraseDialog exec:....." in httpd.conf, i.e. external pass phrase program to supply password for server's private key. The Apache service starts succesfully, but it takes too long and during the execution of the external pass phrase program Apache does not report its service status to the Windows Service Manager. So if the whole mod_ssl startup including the pass phrase program takes too long, some kind timeout in Windows is reached and we get the following Windows error message box:

"Could not start the Apache service on \\computer error 2186. The service is not
responding to the control function."

The error message box can be safely ignored because the service starts succesfully anyway but it is very unpleasant.

All this is especially noticable in Windows NT4 on a slow computer (200Mhz, slow harddisk). Even a simple .bat file which immediately sends the password is not quick enough and the mod_ssl startup takes too long.

If we use an external GUI pass phrase program, which must wait for the user to type in the pass phrase, it is naturally even worse. Note: it is necessary to allow service interaction with desktop for this.
>How-To-Repeat:
In Windows NT4, build, install and configure Apache 1.3.20 with mod_ssl 2.8.4-1.3.20. In httpd.conf, set the SSLPassPhraseDialog parameter like this:
SSLPassPhraseDialog "exec:c:/sendpass.bat" and make the .bat file wait for several seconds and after that actually send the passphrase with "@echo passphrase". Try to start the Apache service. If the .bat file executes long enough (10 second should be more than enough), you should get the behavior descripted above.
>Fix:
Maybe before any module initialization a new Apache thread could be created, which would then report the service "starting" status to Windows and stop reporting it after all modules are initialized and Apache is actually running. After that Apache would report its "running" status as usually.

State-Changed-Why:

Nothing to do with our distribution, mod_ssl is developed
by others.  I'm flagging as suspended, as we may need to
review this bug in Apache 2.0, and your report is logged
for other 1.3 users to search.
