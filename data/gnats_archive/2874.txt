>Environment:
NT 4.0 (SP 3)
compiled version (www.apache.de)
>Description:
A NameVirtualHost IP-Adresse is used with us for different Domains.   
The Domainname should comprise a digit,   
so, the VitualHost entry doesn't work for this Domain!  
Apache takes the first configured VirtualHost-Domain.  
  
>How-To-Repeat:
www.vbg4.de
>Fix:
We had to forgive an own IP-Adresse for this Domain!

State-Changed-Why:

I'm not sure if I understand your report, but you've
most likely misconfigured Apache.

Please read the virtual host documentation at
http://docs.apache.org/vhosts/ and verify your
configuration via 'httpd -S'.
