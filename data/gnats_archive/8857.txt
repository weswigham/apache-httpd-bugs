>Description:
Looks like this is a historic behavior which can be become a security hole, if Apache config is not really reviewed or proper defined.

Config: upper lines do not contain any listen or docroot

Listen 192.168.1.17:80
Listen 192.168.1.18:80
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.17:80>
    DocumentRoot /home/internet/testserver3/pub
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.18:80>
    DocumentRoot /home/internet/testserver3/pub
</VirtualHost>

If second virtual host is disabled, a request to 192.168.1.18:80 is routed to compiled-in docroot (in my case "/usr/htdocs/").

Means: if someone forgot to setup a "default virtual host" but has one listen address with no correspondending "virtual host", compiled-in configuration is used.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description
>Fix:
Hmm, best way would be if any "virtual host" is active, the main will go inactive (e.g. report an error 501 on connect) and must be explicitly reenabled as "default virtual host". Unfortunately, this break many examples and rolled-out configurations.

Comment-Added:
I think the real bug you are reporting here is simply
that DocumentRoot has a compiled in default.

I could perhaps agree that if you don't specify a 
DocumentRoot for a host you are serving, you should
get a 500 error.  But it makes no difference whether
it is a virtualhost or not.
