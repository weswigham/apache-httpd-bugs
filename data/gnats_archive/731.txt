Please excuse this engineering template. I found no other way to communicate

I'm researching for a story on the path of the Information Super Highway...
DATABASE usage on web pages. It comes down to MS SQL server or everyone
else. ( Unix ... the rich man, poor man story )

My point: How can mom and pop build a database in the Unix world to increase
sales for their business when they talk to that world using a W95 box?

I like Apache's approach and market share; Unix HTTPD connectivity; (NT seams to
be buggy as a ISP) but can anyone maintain a DB at 28.8?

Is Apache providing a means to interface with MS Access so users can work on
their DB's offline and then update them without special tools?

This is a serious dead end that business may find after they develope their site.

State-Changed-Why:
We don't supply a database management tool, but an
HTTP server.  If someone wants to use its capabilities
to layer a DB management interface on the Web technology,
more power to them - but that's not our focus.  What you
seek may have already been done; please check out the
Module Registry from the "Releated Projects" page at the
Apache web site.

Thanks for asking, though, and for using Apache.
