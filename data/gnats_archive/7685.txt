>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
linux 2.0.38, libc5, apache 1.3.19 with mod_proxy
>Description:
Using apache as a proxy to come through a firewall the browsers
(tested IE4 and lynx 2.83) get incomplete pages. Lynx reports
"Error - unexpected server disconnect". Sometimes a reload helps,
but not often. It doesn't matter if apache uses a remote proxy or not,
and it happens to very many pages.
Using wwwoffle as a proxy instead at the same host works, and
using masquerading it works, too (but this isn't desired at a
firewall), so I assume the pages and the browsers are OK.
>How-To-Repeat:
Maybe it's a problem with the old libc, but everything else works fine with it.
