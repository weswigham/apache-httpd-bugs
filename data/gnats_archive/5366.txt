I downloaded apache_1.3.9-hp9000_715-hpux10.20.tar.gz  
from http://mirrors.ccs.neu.edu/Apache/dist/binaries/hpux/

During installation, using ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
I got the following result (twice!):

Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html. If you don't
wish to do the port yourself, please submit this output rather
than the patches. Thank you.

Pressing on with the build process, but all bets are off.
Do not be surprised if it fails. If it works, and even
if it does not, please contact the above address.

 Aborting!


My C compiler is :

It is an installation process.
