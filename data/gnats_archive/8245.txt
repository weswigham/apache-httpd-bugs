>Description:
I have made all my htdocs contents server-side-includes aware,
means .htm, .html and so on are parsed for SSI, as I include
the LAST_MODIFIED date and the server name via SSI.
(<!-- ... -->)

The Apache server does not send last-modified info in the header
for server-parsed documents, as it believes
the document is server-parsed and such changed by the server.

But the only change is the name of the server and the last-modified date.

Any search engine will not be able to index the documents together
with last-modified information. That is truly bad.
(So I cannot get the recently modified documents or old documents.)

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.rz.uni-osnabrueck.de/index.htm
>Fix:
Yes. I want the last-modified date send for CGI-scripts, Server-side parsed
documents and so on BY DEFAULT. That is the date, the document or script
was last-modified (via UNIX file system operations).

State-Changed-Why:
Apache can not and will not be configured by default to LIE about the last-modified date.  That will break a lot of things and simply is not the correct thing to do.  The last modified date represents the resource, not whatever script or program is used to generate it.

See the mod_include docs for information on how you can have it add a last-modified date which, in some situations, can be considered valid.  However it would be bogus of Apache to do so by default and would cause people to see stale content.
