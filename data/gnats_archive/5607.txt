i have already successfully compiled apache (with php and ssl) on o2's running IRIX 6.5 and even on an Indy (with a R4600) running IRIX 5.3
but on this indigo2 it won't run.

other compilations (samba, openssl, ssh, ...) work just fine.

i tried to compile it both with gcc and with cc

thanks for any help.
