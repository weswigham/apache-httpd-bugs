>Environment:
Apache-JServ 19981204, Blackdown-JDK 1.1.7A, Linux 2.0.36, RedHat 5.1/X86
>Description:
It seems that the JServ-Tracing is no longer called tracing, but is now called
logging. However, in examples/jserv.properties.in the configuration tags are
still called trace.*. Changing this to log.* gives output in the logfile.

Furthermore, there is a channel that is not mentioned at all: servletLog.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Change the example jserv.properties.in
