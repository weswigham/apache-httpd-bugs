mod_perl-1.19
Apache is compiled with mod-proxy and mod-perl.
>Description:
When comiled with mod_perl,
apache's http proxy cannot access correctly the host which name specified with "ServerName" directive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Let the server have two names: myhost and myalias (in /etc/hosts)
Http server and http proxy are on the same port (80)
sample httpd.conf:
  Servername myhost
  ProxyRequests On
  (other settings are omitted)

then request:
  GET / HTTP/1.0                 : OK
  GET http://myalias/ HTTP/1.0   : OK
  GET http://myhost/ HTTP/1.0    : NG (error_log: "File does not exist: http://myhost/")
>Fix:
This patch can workaround this. (but I think not a "true fix")

Does the behavior change if you don't compile the apache with mod_perl and then compile with mod_perl but don't include anything in the configuration?

What do you mean "the proxy server and the http server runs on the same port"? Do you only run one server?

 Yes. (Please see below)

 I'm sorry for my bad English.
 It means that:
   I run only one server on a "dual homed" machine.
   It's main purpose is the www server for outside (=for the Internet).
   Simultaneously, it serves proxy for our intra-net.
 
 So, I configured the server like below, but it not runs the way what I aimed.
 Today, I retried in whole on my linux-2.0.37 box:
 
 Apache-1.3.6 vanilla:
   tar -xzvf apache_1.3.6.tar.gz
   cd apache_1.3.6
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache.vanilla --enable-module=proxy
   make && make install
 
 Apache-1.3.6 with mod_perl-1.19:
   tar -xzvf apache_1.3.6.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf mod_perl-tar.gz
   cd mod_perl-1.19
   perl Makefile.PL DO_HTTPD=1 USE_APACI=1 EVERYTHING=1 \
   APACI_ARGS='--prefix=/usr/local/apache.modperl --enable-module=proxy'
   make && make install
 
 Then, gave them same config.
 I changed only these 3 lines from "httpd.conf.default":
 
   Port 80
   ServerName myhost
   ProxyRequests On
 
 Name "myhost" is defined as 192.168.0.1 in /etc/hosts, and
 "mywww" is also defined as 192.168.0.1 in /etc/hosts.
 
 And here is the result:
 
 ===[[ Apache-1.3.6 vanilla ]]===========================================

 When returned "404 Not Found", the error_log shows this:
 
   [Fri Jul  2 10:22:15 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist: http://myhost/
 
 It seems that the server missed to select proper handler for the request.
 
 Is this helps you?
