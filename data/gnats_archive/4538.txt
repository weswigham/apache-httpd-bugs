>Description:
We have recently changed over from NCSA to Apache.  Everything seemed OK, 
but Netscape 4 (esp. 4.06) will crash when loading in the site.  IE works fine.

Then sites have a complex frameset, javascript, flash movies, cgi-scripts, 
cascading style sheets and SSI all from the first frameset. (oh yeah, and 
the frames that make up the page are from multiple hosts).

The last thing on the page to load in is the flash movie.  When it has 
loaded, the browser does a refresh of all frames, but crashes.  This 
problem only happens the first time you visit one of the sites(doesn't 
refresh after loading on subsequent visits).

After noticing this problem we tried various ideas to stop crashes, but to 
no avail.  We swithced back to NCSA and everything works(no refresh, no 
crashes).  So there would seem to be a problem with Apache.

The only difference between our setup of NCSA and Apache is that we are using Keepalives in Apache.

Thanks in advance and keep up the good work.
>How-To-Repeat:
It may be possible for me to switch back at some point if a plausable solution 
is suggested so that it can be tested, but due to the fact that this a live 
server

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... if your browser is crashing then your browser is broken.
Nothing Apache can do can make a properly implemented browser
crash.  There could be any number of differences in how
Apache does things and how NCSA does things, but I see no
reason to think Apache is at fault for anything...

 Marc,
 
 I totally agree but I only have problems when running Apache.  If i stop
 Apache and startup NCSA (with same settings(as similar as possible))
 there are no problems with the site viewed through Netscape 4.06
 (without changing the browsers settings (not clearing the cache or
 anything)).
 
 It makes no sense at all.
 
 I don't undestand the browser refreshing on first entry to the site, but
 not on subsequent visits(even after clearing the cache).  This doesn't
 happen on Netscape 4.6.
 
 The browser still 'refreshes' when running NCSA but doesn't crash.!!!
 
 I just can't see what the problem could be.
 
 Thanks for the quick response.
