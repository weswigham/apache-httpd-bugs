Solaris 2.x
>Description:
Using a chroot-patched Apache version, you can crash the Solaris network layers
if the accept-mutex lock file resides in an NFS-mounted area ... all the
socket are closed (even telnet session sometimes !) and the httpd (child and
parent) processes crash :-(
>How-To-Repeat:
Problem already solved
>Fix:
As explained in PR#883, setting the lock file outside a NFS mounted area
resolved the problem ...
Maybe a new real semaphore (using semget, ...) implementation 
(USE_SEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT in http_main.c?) should be investigated for 
systems that support semaphore facility (such as Solaris), instead of 
file locking.

I also think you should default the DEFAULT_LOCKFILE define in httpd.h to
"/var/tmp/accept.lock", instead of "logs/accept.lock", since logs directories
are often NFS-mounted for logs centralization

 If you write logs on an NFS mounted disk then your log files can quite
 easily suffer from corruption.  It's not really a good idea to do that...
 at any rate, the default used to be /var/tmp, but some systems don't have
 that directory.
 
 Yep we should use sysv semaphores as well wherever available.

Two things:

- let's start logging the lockfile (and scoreboard file)
locations at startup

- use sysv semaphores

State-Changed-Why:
We've found no good (portable) way to defend against this.  The
LockFile directive can be used to retarget the lock file to a
non-NFS mounted directory.  In 1.3 there are other locking options
which don't require a file, and wouldn't break NFS... except they
don't seem to be reliable on solaris either.  So there's not
much we can do.
