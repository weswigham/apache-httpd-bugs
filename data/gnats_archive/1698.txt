>Description:
The default srm.conf file states:

---
#ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/

# If you want to use server side includes, or CGI outside
# ScriptAliased directories, uncomment the following lines.

# AddType allows you to tweak mime.types without actually editing it, or to
# make certain files to be certain types.
# Format: AddType type/subtype ext1

# AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers",
# actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
# or added with the Action command (see below)
# Format: AddHandler action-name ext1
---

The instructions for activating "CGI outside ScriptAliased directories" is
misleading, and offers no valid information. There is no other attainable
documentation for this action.
>How-To-Repeat:
Read the src.conf file
>Fix:
Add more thorough docs on this subject.

Thanks so much%2

State-Changed-Why:
Right below the section you quote, it says:

   # To use CGI scripts:
   #AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

that seems clear to me.

This topic is also covered in the FAQ.

 I should add that the current config files are a hacked mess from hell
 that have grown into an unordered mess over time and should be rewritten.
 It is being worked on slowly.
