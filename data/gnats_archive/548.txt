>Environment:
HP-UX 9.x/10.x, 1.2b10 (though this isn't os-specific).
>Description:
We'd like to have the ability to specify hosts who do not have any information
about their accesses logged. We use this so that certain internal users (mostly
support staff) don't have their info tossed in with everyone else's info. CERN's
server has this, we find it quite useful.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Implement a NoLog directive, with the parameter being the (possibly wildcarded)
host(s) and/or IP addresses which are exempt from logging

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for the suggestion. Although it is now
too late for new features in 1.2, this will be considered
for inclusion in the next version.

In the meantime, it is a fairly easy matter to process
your log files after they have been generated, to remove
unwanted domains. It may be better to do this anyway, since
any additional processing in Apache could affect its
overall performance.

State-Changed-Why:

This can be done with conditional logging as of the
next release after 1.3.4.  See the mod_log_config
documentation page after the release comes out.
Thanks for your patience, and for using Apache!
