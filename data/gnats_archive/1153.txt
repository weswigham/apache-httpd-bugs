>Description:
I have a redirect for a virtual web site:

Redirect                permanent /nawc http://warcouncil.mpog.com

When calling any normal /nawc/file it redirects to warcouncil.mpog.com/file
correctly. A cgi call with params also works:
/nawc/file?a=1 -> warcouncil.mpog.com/file?a=1
However, if there is a #number param, it is lost, ie:
/nawc/file#2900 -> warcouncil.mpog.com/file
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a perm redirect, and try calling an old location file with a #number
parameter.
>Fix:
Can the Location printed by the Redirect include the original # parameter%3

State-Changed-When: Sat Sep 20 12:30:24 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The fragment (string after the #) is not a part of
the URL and is not passed to the server.  The server
has absolutely no way to know what it is so it can't
do anything with it.
