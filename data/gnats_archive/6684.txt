uname -a: Linux brian 2.4.0-test9 #3 Sam Okt 7 13:07:02 CEST 2000 i586 unknown
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
apache 1.3.14 with eapi-patch from mod_ssl-2.7.0-1.3.14
mm-1.1.2
>Description:
testet with both versions of gcc.

the Rules in httpd.conf:

RewriteEngine   on

RewriteLog      /var/log/httpd/rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 2

RewriteMap      lowercase       int:tolower

RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/icons/*
RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/pics/*
RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/dav/*
RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/cgi-bin/*
RewriteRule     ^/(.*)$         /home/httpd/%{SERVER_NAME}/html/$1

RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/cgi-bin/
RewriteRule     ^/cgi-bin/(.*)$ /home/httpd/${lowercase:%{SERVER_NAME}}/cgi-bin/$1 [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]

RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/icons/
RewriteRule     ^/icons/(.*)$   /home/httpd/${lowercase:%{SERVER_NAME}}/icons/$1

RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/pics/
RewriteRule     ^/pics/(.*)$    /home/httpd/${lowercase:%{SERVER_NAME}}/pics/$1

the result in rewrite_log:

without lowercase (Rule 1) this seems to be OK:
(2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /index.php
(2) rewrite /index.php -> /home/httpd/brian.telco-tech.de/html/index.php
(2) local path result: /home/httpd/brian.telco-tech.de/html/index.php
(1) go-ahead with /home/httpd/brian.telco-tech.de/html/index.php [OK]

with lowercase (Rule 5) this seems to be not OK:
(2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /pics/linux-logo.png
(2) rewrite /pics/linux-logo.png -> /home/httpd/%{server_name}/pics/linux-logo.png
(2) local path result: /home/httpd/%{server_name}/pics/linux-logo.png
(1) go-ahead with /home/httpd/%{server_name}/pics/linux-logo.png [OK]

tracked in PR6671.
