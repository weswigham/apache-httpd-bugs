Sun C 4.0 compilers.  Tried with

-xO2 -native  and also just -g
>Description:
We have a set of rewrite directives that worked OK before with beta's 6,7,8,
but they don't work in b10.

The target location of the rewrite is available and working OK.

Here are the rules in use:

DocumentRoot /home/www/data
<Directory /home/www/data>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule /people$ /people/ [L,R]
RewriteRule /people/$ /cgi-bin/people [L]
RewriteRule /people/([a-z0-9A-Z]+)$ /people/$1/ [L,R]
RewriteRule /people/([a-z0-9A-Z]+)/$ /users/$1/www/ [L]
RewriteRule /people/([a-z0-9A-Z]+)/(.*) /users/$1/www/$2
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride All
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>


This turns /peole/name into  /users/name/www which locates the users $HOME
via this alias:

Alias /users /home

using http://server/users/name/www works just fine.

The error for http://server/people is:

File Not Found

The requested URL /people was not found on this server.

Which makes me think that somehow the mod_rewrite module is being ignored.

I checked using the info module; mod_rewrite was compiled in.		
>How-To-Repeat:
I guess you can mimic this config and see if it works.
>Fix:
No, I don't.  Given that it was working in earlier releases, I'd look to see
what changed in the code (sorry, I'm not being too helpful here)

 I just rebuilt 1.2b8 using the Configuration file from 1.2b10
 
 the rewrite works in this fresh build of 1.2b8; it doesn't in 1.2b10.
 
 If don't change the Configuration, the rewrite rules don't work.

State-Changed-Why:
What happens if you use:

RewriteRule /people/([a-z0-9A-Z]+)/(.*) /users/$1/www/$2 [PT]

instead of the last rewriterule in your config?

You're relying on an interaction between mod_alias and mod_rewrite
which the docs cover a bit.  It's not something that should
have changed between b8 and b10.  You should have required the
[PT] in b8 as well.  But please give it a try anyhow.

Thanks
Dean
