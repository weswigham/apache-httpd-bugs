>Description:
When i try to get www.novell.com/groupwise/administration/gwadmin.html 
the client timed out. If i do a telnet on port 80 and give him the URL
i get the file. The Novell site seems to work with a Cold Fusion server,
maybe he doesn't interact correctly with apache ?

State-Changed-Why:

I'm afraid we cannot help you if you have a problem
with Cold Fusion. Please talk to the Cold Fusion
authors instead.
You are always welcome to submit a new bugreport if you
can track down the problem to be an Apache bug, but without
further information we cannot help you.
