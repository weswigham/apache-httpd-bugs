Windows 98 4.10.1998
>Description:
I Installed Apache on my system without any problems (no errors in the install.log)
I changed the ServerName in the httpd.conf to my IP address
Server starts (message: "Apache/1.3.11 (win32) running ..."), but doesn't respond to any request (i tried both "localhost" and ip-address). 
The logfiles stay empty. 

I tried the same installation on a Windows NT platform and encountered no problems.

Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks!
Xander

State-Changed-Why:

There aren't any identified problems with 98 specifically
that I can point you too.  I would suggest you try version
1.3.12 or the forthcoming 1.3.13 release to see if that
solves your problem.
