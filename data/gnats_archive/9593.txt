Windows NT-4.00.1381 Pentium 3 866MHZ Memory 128Mb
>Description:
We are generating html files every 20 seconds in the Apache home directory
via a java program. The html files contain a meta tag to refresh every 15 seconds. There are collisions and it's not long until the web page is corrupted.
Cannot seem to find any way to tell Apache to synchronise with the file creation.
>How-To-Repeat:
On intranet so not possible to provide a URL
>Fix:
Cannot find anything in the docs, but suspect that this problem must be common.

State-Changed-When: Sat Jan 26 10:41:43 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

You need to switch to the new file in an atomic operation.
On unix, that means putting the new content in a temporary
file, then "mv file.tmp file.html".  I don't know what the
win32 equivalent is, but since this is not a bug report
about the Apache HTTP Server, it doesn't belong here, and
I am closing the report.

Thanks for using Apache.
