>Description:
It would be good to have access to the mod_env directives (SetEnv, etc.) from
the .htaccess file.  Currently, they can only be used in the *.conf files.

Making these availible in .htaccess would help those of us who have our sites
hosted on machines where we do not control the *.conf files.

For example, PHP requires that the TMPDIR envirionment variable be set outside
of a script for file uploads (PUT) to work.  This makes uploads impossible with
PHP -- unless I can get this change implemented (My IPP will be more comfortable
installing a new version of Apache than patching their installation with my
patches.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Put a SetEnv directive in the .htaccess file.  Watch the error log when
a file in that directory is accessed.
