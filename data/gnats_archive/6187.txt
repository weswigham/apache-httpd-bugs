>Organization:
>Environment:
Win2k Professional, MSVC++ 6.0sp3
>Description:
Apache 2.0a4 will not build on Win2k because there is a missing export in src/ApacheCore.def. Specifically "ap_process_config_tree @407". This was kindly pointed out to me by Jim Patterson on comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to build Apache 2.0a4 with MSVC++ 6.0
>Fix:
Add ap_process_config_tree @407 to the very end of src/ApacheCore.def
