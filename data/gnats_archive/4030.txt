>Organization:
>Environment:
Sun Ultra-1, Solaris 2.6 (aka SunOS 5.6) and its make, gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
After configuring apache 1.3.4 for suexec, make stops when trying to build 
suexec.o from suexec.c. This is due to a simple typo in the top-level Makefile.
The source code cannot be found and make exits with something like:

--------------------- screen output BEGIN --------------------------

gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=260 \
                -DHTTPD_USER=\"www\" \
                -DUID_MIN=100 \
                -DGID_MIN=100 \
                -DUSERDIR_SUFFIX=\"public_html\" \
                -DLOG_EXEC=\"/usr/local/apache/logs/suexec_log\" \
                -DDOC_ROOT=\"/usr/local/apache/htdocs\" \
                -DSAFE_PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin\" \ suexec.c
gcc:  suexec.c: No such file or directory
gcc: No input files
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `suexec.o'
Current working directory /tmp/apache_1.3.4/src/support
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `build-support'
Current working directory /tmp/apache_1.3.4
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `build'

--------------------- screen output END --------------------------

The problem is the line
                -DSAFE_PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin\" \ suexec.c
                                                       ^^^
>How-To-Repeat:
I think, anyone who tries to build apache 1.3.4 with suexec gets this error.
I did exactly what is described in the README.configure example (line 98ff).

>Fix:
I fixed the problem by editing the Makefile manually. Here the patch

-------- patch BEGIN --------------------
181c181,182
<                       -DSAFE_PATH=\"$(suexec_safepath)\"' \
---
>                       -DSAFE_PATH=\"$(suexec_safepath)\" \
>               ' \
-------- patch BEGIN --------------------

A better way would be to correct the mistake in the templates/configure script,
but I lack the knowledge and time to do so.

 Since I'm not running Solaris on any of the systems I have access to, I guess, I'm not the one who'd sent a problem report. This assumption is not proven but at least hardened by the fact, that I can't remember neither the situation prior to the fault no r the fault itself.
 
 In this case, you should try to reach the other guy who'd made this experience in his personal reality.
 
 In any other case, try "42" as the most probable answer to any of your upcoming questions belonging to this concern. This is just a proposal, but better than just hot air, which is the stuff all other answers you could request from me would consist of -  as far as they belong to the category mentioned above.
 
 Ok, guys, it's about 0:45h AM and, re-reading my reply to your mail, it's definitely time to go to bed.
 
 Have a nice day :-)
 
 A bientôt
    Peter

Please re-try your build with Apache 1.3.9 and the
APACI method (apache-1.3/configure, make, make install)
and see if the problem still exists.

 FYI: This bug (suexec/4030) was reintroduced in or before Apache
 1.3.12 due to the addition of the $(suexec_umask) parameter to the
 EXTRA_CFLAGS.  Here is a patch (to the generated Makefile, but looks
 like it would apply fine to Makefile.tmpl) that makes it work on my
 configuration.
