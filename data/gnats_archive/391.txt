Linux 2.0.18, RedHat pre-compiled Apache
>Description:
I have httpd working properly during 3 months. The server doesn't have high
load, it's an Intranet server. The main function of it is 
to process CGI scripts. But last month I get a message:
httpd: caught SIGSEGV, dumping core 
maybe 3-4 times a day,depending on load of server. 
>How-To-Repeat:
It happens 1-10 minutes after http request, but server doesnt stop working.
>Fix:
Reinstall with a new version of Apache%3
