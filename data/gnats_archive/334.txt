>Description:
I'd like to server when asking for example for index.html to send index.shtml 
with SSI. 
Is it like 
Redirect index.html http://www.com/index.shtml

.htaccess file results in an error which states "The server encountered
an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request":

Where is the problem ?

Various problems related to this are cleaned up in 1.2b9.

Another workaround for this is to name your file
"index.html.shtml" and ensure that Options MultiViews is
enabled.  You can also use "DirectoryIndex index.shtml"
to support .shtml indexes (but that doesn't help if people
explicitly type index.html, which the multiviews method does
solve).
