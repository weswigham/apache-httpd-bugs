Compiler: gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I'm not getting a core dump.  I've compiled the source code and built a binary.

When I run the binary either alone or via -apachectl-, the message

semctl(IPC_SET): Bad address

appears in the error log and the server just quits.

I'd be happy to give you whatever information you need to try to track this
problem down.
