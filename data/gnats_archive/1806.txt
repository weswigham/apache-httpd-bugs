>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation with Service Pack 3
Visual C++ 5.0 with Visual Studio Service Pack 3 (note: used precompiled binary)
>Description:
When I start the service, the service setup dialog hangs.  Then it tells me that the service failed to start because it did not reply to the control response in a timely manner.  I setup the service by running "apache -i -d "C:/Program Files/Apache".  The server runs fine if I just run it from command line though.

State-Changed-When: Sun Feb 15 07:54:05 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Yes, at the moment Apache does not run very well as
a service unless it is installed in C:\APACHE. This will
be fixed in a later release (but not 1.3b5).

This bug will be tracked in PR#1489.
