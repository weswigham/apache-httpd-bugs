I work for the biggest Norwegian ISP.
2 of our servers have 150+ virtual hosts on each (and still groving). We have now decided to run the 2 servers with suexec and apply a different User (same 
group) to each  of the virtual hosts (running cgi-scripts would be safer with that). When applying an unknown user or group, the server does  an exit telling
us it was a bad user/group name. 

The database that holds usernames and groups are updated by the Customer Service dep. /etc/password is updated form that database. Imagine what will  happen when we rotate the web-server logs at 11:55 pm and one of the customers 
have terminated it's contract and the username is gone from /etc/password? Yes, 
the server would not start...

An ignore of the virtual host(s) with bad user name/group would be much safer 
than an exit of the whole server...
>How-To-Repeat:
Just specify an unknown user or group in the VirtualHost
>Fix:
How about an ignore of the VirtualHost (printing that to STDERR) instead of an
exit of the whole server...


Best regards

State-Changed-Why:
There are cases where it would be a security problem if
the User directive fails to set properly.  The default user
might have privileges that the server admin does not want 
applied to a certain section.  In that case it is safer to
quit than to continue processing.  Since we aren't set up to have a 
"conditional reload" - i.e. don't load a new configuration
if the new one is broken - the only thing we can do is fail
at this point.
