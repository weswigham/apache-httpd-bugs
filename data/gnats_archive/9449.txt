>Environment:
Linux 2.2.19pre17 Debian i686 
>Description:
I am trying to configure apache for delivery of static html files in case they exist. 
(These files - if they exist - have been exported before.) However, the following lines
in httpd.conf don't work with 1.3.22:

# these two lines work, they are put here just for a better understanding:
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !/html/
RewriteRule (.*/)dyn(/.*) $1html$2 [NS,C,QSA]   # dyn is handled by mod_caucho
# this line fails:
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s

Please note, that I thoroughly checked the logs and all permissions. There
are no typos whatsoever. 
Example: There is an existing file named 
'/home/application/html/portal_jsp/50765.html', all permissions are ok. 
However, the rewrite_log reports:  => not matched
I think this is a bug.

>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
should be quite simple ;)
