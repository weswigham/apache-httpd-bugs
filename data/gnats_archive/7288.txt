>Organization:
>Environment:
SuSe Linux 7.1, (Suse-)Kernel 2.4(.0), Raiser-FS, mod_php 4.0.1pl1 (currently all original SuSE rpm's)
Note: running in a VMware (v2.0.3) Virtual Machine @ Win2k (I never had any problems with VMware, and I'm using it since v1.x)
>Description:
I've added 3 virtual servers to the httpd.conf of SuSe Linux 7.1. I'm quite sure everythng is ok with the config ("httpd -S" shows no problems). But every 2nd or 3rd click (or better GET-request) Apache shows a path/file error because it searches the file in the (main-)server-Root and not the virtual-server-root (as the error-log tells me).
After trying/clicking 2-3 times, Apache finds the right file, reload page doesn't help.
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry. internal network/VMware
>Fix:
Well, perhaps it's not an Apache-only issue, but a "Apache on Kernel 2.4 and Raiser-FS"-issue?

State-Changed-Why:

Sorry, but you don't provide nearly enough information
here (excerpts of your configuration, the exact URLs
that cause problems, error and access log entries, etc).  
In all likelihood, this is a configuration issue
which you should probably address in a user support
forum like news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix

Thanks for using Apache!
