>Environment:
Windows 98 with MSI 2.0 installed
>Description:
While trying to install the latest version im getting:

Error 1316.A network error occured while attempting to read from the file C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\_is1083\apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.msi

It seems like you have forgotten to change a value before you compiled the installationsoftware (MSI) for this distribution. That way it tries to access a file that does not exist. Which will end up in this failure.

Please correct your win32 binary distribution so that I can update my Apache installation.

Best regards
Apachez
>How-To-Repeat:
Update the configuration file for your MSI installer before compile the new .msi object.
>Fix:
Yes, please check the configuration file for MSI and change all references from .22 to .23 and the installer should work.

State-Changed-Why:

User reports uninstalling and reinstalling Apache [as well
as cleaning out some registry cruft] solved the problem
nicely.
