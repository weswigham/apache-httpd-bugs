>Description:
With following configuration in apache's httpd.conf

ProxyPass /mirror       http://remote.server.com
ProxyPassReverse /mirror http://remote.server.com

Works fine as long no html pages contains 
URL links (http://remote.server.com/page.html) to it self on the remote server.

Then the web browser try to get http://remote.server.com/page.html instead of 
http://local.site.com/mirror/page.html

State-Changed-Why:
That is correct.  That is the way it is supposed to function.
Apache does not try to parse the body of documents to rewrite
references in it.  This feature is only designed for use under
controlled situations where you can ensure pages contain no such references.
