 You may want to check your hpux compile flags that you used for the OCI
 build and make sure you built a shared library properly.
 
 CFLAGS needs to be +z if you're compiling with HPUX compilers, and -fPIC
 if you're using gcc. The HPUX linker ld also needs LDFLAGS="-b" when
 linking to create shared libraries. The resulting .so's also need r/x
 permissions, so they should have 755 perms.
 
 good luck,

 hi Cody,
 
 Cflags_shlib = + z and ldflags_shlib= -b given and 755
 permission also exists. after that only I am facing
 this problem
 
 Please give me some other suggestions on this
 
 Thanks & Regards

This really seems like a PHP problem which should
go to the PHP bug database (or, more properly,
a PHP mailing list).

Thanks for using Apache!
