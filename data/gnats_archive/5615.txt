>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 6.1 kernel 2.2.12-20 - GCC w/distro. Apache is NOT from the distro. (Sorry, no uname on this machine).
>Description:
The PATH environment variable is getting corrupted with non ASCII bytes. Using configuration directives to set and export PATH solves the problem, but there may be a buffer overrun somewhere.

No other software on my system demonstrates this behaivor. 1.3.6 doesn't do it either so I suspect only 1.3.9 is affected.

I've rebuilt Apache with and without mod_perl. I'm not using suexec. I can't think of any other modules that would affect PATH in this way so I suspect it to be in the core. 

>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure you can.

This is a bit of an odd one and not a priority. I'm posting it to see if anyone else might have seen it or if it is unique (maybe I need to update some libs).
>Fix:
I'm not familiar with the source tree of Apache (yet). Perhaps you can give me a starting point and when I have time, I can hunt it down (would love to contribute).
