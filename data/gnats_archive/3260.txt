SunOS moses 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2      
>Description:
I encountered the following problems with Apache 1.3.3 during
a mass test (about 250 mostly parallel wgets on the same URL):

- in one case Apache stop serving any request with the following message:
[Wed Oct 21 11:42:10 1998] [error] server reached MaxClients setting, consider raising the MaxClients setting
  I had to restart Apache after this message

- after increasing the number of maxclients I got lots of messages:
  Wed Oct 21 11:42:33 1998] [crit] [client 10.2.0.42] (13)Permission denied: /home/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable
  Why will Apache look in /home/.htaccess ? Serverroot und DOcumentroot are somewhere deep under /home !

- if Apache is started with -X I see MORE than one httpd processes although
  the documentation says it is running in single-process mode

   moses@/home/ajung/testbed(54)% ps -ef | grep httpd
   ajung    55 16424  1 12:35:29 pts/21   0:00 ./httpd -X -f /home/ajung/testbed/SZ.conf
   ajung    57    56  0 12:35:30 pts/21   0:00 ./httpd -X -f /home/ajung/testbed/SZ.conf
   ajung    60  7669  0 12:35:31 pts/31   0:00 grep httpd
   ajung    56    55  0 12:35:30 pts/21   0:00 ./httpd -X -f /home/ajung/testbed/SZ.conf                   

Any comments ? Best regards,
Andreas

 Are you sure your client didn't just have all the connections open and was
 keeping them open?  It sounds to me like it just kept opening connections
 until it reached the configured maximum, then couldn't open any more.  I
 don't see any reason to think anything is wrong with Apache in that case.

 Yes, there is supposed to be more than one process.  There is supposed to
 be a parent and a child.  Do you have any extra modules (eg. jserv)
 compiled in?  Certain modules will start an extra child.
