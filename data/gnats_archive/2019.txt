>Description:
in the file http_protocol.c (both for versions 1.2.5 and 1.2.6),
in the function "parse_uri()", the stop condition of a loop parsing
a URI is incorrect.

This may not cause a problem in actual use sinc the loop while "break"
upon easily met conditions.

What would actually happen is the loop break at an incorrect point.
>How-To-Repeat:
By submitting a very weird URL that would fail the checks inside the loop.
>Fix:
at line 515 (in version 1.2.6) replace
    for (s=uri; s != '\0'; s++)
with
    for (s=uri; *s != '\0'; s++)
which should be more reliable since uri is a null terminated string.
