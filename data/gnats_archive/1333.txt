State-Changed-Why:
This looks like you're using a precompiled binary which was
build with mod_auth_db, and you haven't installed the db
library on your system.

You want to install the redhat packages db-1.85 and db-1.85-devel.
If you're not sure how to do that, ask in a redhat support
group.  Thanks.
