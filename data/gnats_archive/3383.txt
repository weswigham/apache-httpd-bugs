State-Changed-Why:
Closing misfiled PR.  Please be sure NOT to change the subject
line when replying; without the "os-windows/3293" at the
start, the bug tracking system can't file it with the old
PR so creates a new one.  Plus, we have no idea what PR you
are talking about without trying to search to guess what it could be.

Thanks.

>Unformatted:
This problem has been solved. As predicted, it was either going to be something really trivial, or something really obscure. It was trivial:

Despite many hours careful checking of everything, the shebang line to the Perl executable, which should have read

#!C:\PERL\5.00502\bin\MSWin32-x86-object\perl.exe

in fact read

#!C:\PERL\5.005002\bin\MSWin32-x86-object\perl.exe

That's all.  Everything now appears to run OK, and I look forwards to happy programming on a great, free, system.
