>Description:
If you send enough connections at Jserv in the sessionTimeout period that
continuously create new sessions (ie, they do not accept/use cookies), 
it's possible to kill JServ with an EOutofMemory exception. Obviously there's
no way to completely prevent this, but it could be made substantially more 
difficult by adding a second much shorter session.timeout value for isNew 
sessions.
>How-To-Repeat:
load jserv with a smaller heap size, set up a bunch of JMeters slamming it
in such a way that sessions are created, you will crash. :)
>Fix:
alter JServServletManager to handle a secondary newsession.timeout (perhaps
a 5 minute default?) and alter run() to:

if((sysMillis - sess.lastAccessTime > sessionTimeout) ||
  ((sess.isNew()) && (sysMillis - sess.lastAccessTime > newSessionTimeout))) {
