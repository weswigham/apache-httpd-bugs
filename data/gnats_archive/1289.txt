When someone, using windows, tries to access my homepage they only see the
title. but take a look at http://hem1.passagen.se/skuribk/jd . 
It's exactly the same htdocs on that shell as in my /var/lib/httpd/htdocs
directory. And it works there. But not on my server.
Kinda hard to explain .. but please help me!

 Please read some documents or books on HTML structure. Try
 http://www.w3.org/. You are failing to notice that you used
 <FRAME>/<FRAMESET> tags within a <BODY>.  It has nothing to do with the
 <BODY> attributes. This bug report is closed and I do not expect to have
 to answer this question again. Thank you.
