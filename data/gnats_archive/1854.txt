 Can you try setting EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT in your
 src/Configuration file and rebuilding?
 
 Thanks

 Done.   The server is running at http://merlin.albany.net:80/  Give it a
 try at whatever time interval you'd like.

 I was under the impression this server was under load.  If it's not under
 load and you're using NFS then it's more likely the problem has to do with
 your LockFile setting.

 The server is not under load.  All main directories are mounted locally.
 (user ~ pages are mounted via. NFS)
 
 The server would stop serving requests after a number of minutes.  This
 timeframe has not been calculated.
 
 It is also not known if the server will hang if placed under a consistent
 load.  I did not set up a load generation process to constantly stress the
 server.
 
 All I do know if that the symptoms are the same as PR#1425.  After an
 unspecified period of time the server will hang.  A kill -USR1 will
 revive the server.
 
 Solaris 2.5.1 ultraSPARC, gcc 2.7.2.2 -O3, standard modules plus status.

 If you want to try this, the program src/test/zb.c is useful for stressing
 the server.

 I'm pretty certain 1425 is on a server that was under a consistent load,
 it may not have been heavy.  But the url you gave me looks like a testing
 server that nobody but you or me would be accessing... at any rate the
 problem doesn't appear to be happening with USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
 
 Would you be able to switch back to the defaults (minus the
 -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT) and then run zb against the server?  Or
 otherwise stress it? 
 
 Thanks
 Dean

 Done.  I'm stressing it now:
 
 [draco]:10:55am:~/apache_1.3b3/src/test% while (1)
 while? ./zb merlin / -n 1000
 while? end
 
 Tell me when I can ^C the while or if you'd like higher concurrency...
 
 Thanks

 Er, if it's still going then you can hit ^C.
 
 I think I'm confused what problem you're having... if this test is running
 fine on the plain apache 1.3b5 then what is it that you're seeing?

 Done.

 What I am seeing is this:
 
 Apache 1.3b5 Solaris 2.5.1 gcc 2.7.2.2 -O3 sun4u
 
   When a server is under *no* load for a period of time the server seizes.
 
 - From the above tests we ran, I can say that the server will perform well
 for quite some time as long as it's serving requests.  If it goes idle for
 more than (x) minutes, something happens and the server hangs.
 
 Right this minute I killed and restarted the server.  If I let it sit
 and check back in an hour, I'll find it hung.  I will have to kill -USR1
 the server to get it to come back to life.
 
 I'll write you when it's hung.

State-Changed-When: Mon Mar  2 17:12:44 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
We'll be removing USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT from the defaults
for Solaris starting with 1.3b6.  In the meanwhile if you want to
try it, you can add -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to EXTRA_CFLAGS
and edit Configure to remove -lpthread from the libs.
