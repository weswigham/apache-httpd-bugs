Good grief.  Apache is a web server, not a ftp server.
So of course you can't ftp to it!

 Hello Marc,
 
 YES, it must be possible to FTP to the Apache server,
 I work for winegroups and they run Apache 1.2 on a
 sun machine, I can FTP to that machine with WS-FTP
 but Euronet the provider will not tell me how they did
 it.
 
 The only thing I want is put my own server in the
 network of a provider and then change or update
 my website remote with a FTP program.
 THIS MUST BE POSSIBLE.
 
 Your Sincerely, Jos Moonen...

Good grief is right.  They're obviously running an FTP
server on that system *in addition to* Apache, which is
a Web server, not an FTP server.

 Let me refrain my question,
 if you do an update on your homepage,
 how do you do it :
 
 1) walk to the Server and copy your files there
 
 2) start a FTP program and do it remote.
 
 Option 2 is what I want, because my server will be
 miles away.
 
 Your Sincerely, Jos Moonen...

 Get a ftp server and install it.
 
 As I said, Apache is a web server.  It is not a ftp server.  If you want a
 ftp server, get a ftp server.
