>Description:
As noted in bug PR number 5633, mod_rewrite escapes QUERY_STRINGS on redirects.
The use of ';' as a cgi field separator (as recomanded by w3c) becomes impossible
since after rewrinting it becomes '%3b'. It should be addressed at least with
explicit options.L
>How-To-Repeat:
RewriteRule   ^/R/([A-Za-z_]+)$   /R.php?A=1  [R,L]
>Fix:
User side: step back to '&' (which is not escaped), but not recomanded.  
Developer side: add an option to control escaping.
