>Description:
I have a pretty normal setup, with the following RewriteRule entries in httpd.conf:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/img/(.*) http://www.sierra.com/img/$1

(Basically, anything in the top level 'img' directory should be pulled from our
live server).

However, when I request <http://eddie.sierra.com//img> I get a directory listing
of the top level img directory on eddie instead of getting forwarded to the top
level img directory on www.sierra.com.

So it seems that the Rewrite stuff is being called before the server cleans up
the URL -- such as replacing // with /.

Not that big of a deal, since people shouldn't put // in their URLs anyway, but
it happened at least once.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://eddie.sierra.com//img is an example how it goes wrong.

http://eddie.sierra.com/img gets redirected to http://www.sierra.com/img
>Fix:
Re-arrange the order of how the modules get called... clean up the URL first
and then pass it on to the modules. 

Honestly I haven't looked at the src much so I'm not sure if this is possible...

Let me know if I can help out in any way

State-Changed-Why:
mod_rewrite is doing what you're asking it to.  The
url "http://eddie.sierra.com//img" doesn't have a trailing
/, so it can't match "^/img/(.*)".  Try this:

RewriteRule ^/*img(.*) http://www.sierra.com/img$1

 Dean - 
 
 I made a typo in my url...  even when I try http://stage.sierra.com//img/
 it still doesn't get remapped.  (eddie has been replaced by stage).
 
 Sorry my example was off....

State-Changed-Why:
The user really has to problems. First as Dean said /img
cannot match ^/img/(.*) and second //img also cannot
match ^/img/(.*). So 

1. mod_rewrite is correct because it does what the
   has configured. There is no way and no need to
   any automatic "slash-cleanups". mod_rewrite matches
   against the given URL as is (as long it still is not 
   rewritten by a another rewrite rule) 
2. When double slashed can occur the user had to
   change its rewrite rule to ^/+img... as Dean said.
3. When he wants cleanup any double slashes he has
   to do so explicitly, for instance via 
   RewriteRule (.*)//+(.*)  $1/$2  [next]

So, this is not a problem of mod_rewrite. 
Its a matter of correct configuration of the 
rewrite rules. The URL Rewriting Engine can only do
what it is configured to do. And it does not more
and not less...
