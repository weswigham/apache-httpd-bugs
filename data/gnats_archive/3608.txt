WinNT4.0 workstation/Service pack 3
>Description:
I installed apache1.3.3 for WinNT from the folling file:
apache_1_3_3.exe        09-Oct-1998 02:14   2.7M  1.3.3 Win32 binary

After all the basic configuration, I do some modification in srm.conf 
as follows because a file name start with a '.' is not allowed in WinNT. 

#########################################################
AccessFileName _htaccess

<Files _htaccess>
order allow,deny
deny from all
</Files>
#########################################################

But I can still access the file '_htaccess' through a client.
