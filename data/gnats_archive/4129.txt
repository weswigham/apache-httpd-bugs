>Description:
<http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html> says:

	" Beginning with Apache 1.3.5, the mod_log_config module has also
	subsumed the RefererIgnore functionality from _mod_log_referer_. The
	effect of RefererIgnore can be achieved by combinations of _SetEnvIf_ 
	directives and conditional CustomLog definitions.

and <http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_setenvif.html> gives the example

		SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.(gif)|(jpg)|(xbm)$" object_is_image
		SetEnvIf Referer www\.mydomain\.com intra_site_referral
  

	The first will set the envariable object_is_image if the request was
	for an image file, and the second sets intra_site_referral if the 
	referring page was somewhere on the www.mydomain.com Web site.

This does NOT, however, simulate the behaviour of the RefererIgnore directive in
mod_log_referer.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The "correct" construction, which reproduces the behaviour of

	RefererIgnore www.mydomain.com

is

	SetEnvIf Referer "^http://www\.mydomain\.com|www\.mydomain\.com" intra_site_referral

 Whoops!
 
 To *really* simulate the RefererIgnore directive, you also need to drop  
 blank http_referer fields. So make that:
 
 	SetEnvIf Referer "^http://www\.mydomain\.com|www\.mydomain\.com|^$"  
 intra_site_referral

State-Changed-Why:

I'll grant your point about the null Referer value, but why
do you think the full URI needs to be specified?  The
mod_log_referer module just checks to see if the RefereIgnore
string appears anywhere in the Referer field value.  It
doesn't check only the host portion of the Referer URI.

Comment-Added:

Sorry, you're not saying the full URI is required, just
that the test text be anchored at the beginning of the
string.  Which is still not a requirement of mod_log_referer.

 I'm not sure what we are quibbling about.
 
 The NCSA http-referer log, with the RefererIgnore directive, ignored blank  
 HTTP_REFERER fields and HTTP_REFERER fields which are URIs from the named web  
 site.
 
 I expect that there are various different regular expressions one could  
 write down which would accomplish this in mod_log_referer. However, if the  
 documentation states that
 
 	mod_log_referer and
 
 		SetEnvIf Referer REGEXP
 
 	simulate the NCSA behaviour
 
 then they ought to do that. The fact that mod_log_referer logs null  
 HTTP_REFERER fields is a departure from the behaviour of NCSA http-referer  
 log. That should be noted in the docs.
 
 Perhaps my modification of your sample REGEXP only muddies the issue.
