>Description:
The same error i report in your database (#2494 and #2707), still present in release 
1.3.6: reloading a 16 bit CGI (mine are Clipper EXE), report this error:

[Fri Apr 16 09:30:48 1999] [error] [client 192.168.0.12] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: c:/internet/apache/cgi-bin/test2.exe

The file TEST2.EXE is present in /cgi-bin/ directory, and with 32 bit CGI the server works fine...
>How-To-Repeat:
I can send a 16 bit CGI to replicate the problem.
>Fix:
Yes: look at...
