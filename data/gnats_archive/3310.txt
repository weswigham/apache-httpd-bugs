Linux pen.pen.nl 2.0.18 #1 Tue Sep 10 10:15:48 EDT 1996 i586
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
Apache 1.3.3 caused a load of 14 on our Linux system. There were according to the logfiles no unusual hits to our server that would suggest an attempt to hack the system.

There seemed to be about 5 http daemons which took up all the CPU. 

After restarting the webserver the load decreased to normal level again.

State-Changed-Why:

Sorry, but there isn't enough information in this report for
us to know what might be happening.  If this is still a
problem with a more recent version of Apache, then please
attempt to attach a debugger to the busy child process, or
identify some means of repeating the problem.

Notes on how to do this are provided at

   http://dev.apache.org/debugging.html
