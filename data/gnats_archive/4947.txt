>Environment:
I'm running NT 4.0 SR 4 and your WIN32 1.3.9 binary code (no local compile)
>Description:
I had WIN32 1.3.6 installed OK.  Removed it, and its service.  Installed 1.3.9 
and used start button tab to create NT service under 1.3.9.  No service was 
created.
>How-To-Repeat:
Since I went back and forth from 1.3.6 and 1.3.9 a few times to try to work 
this out and every time 1.3.9 had the same problem I'll assume that you to would
have the issue.
>Fix:
Sorry I don't.
I have gone back to win32 1.3.6.
