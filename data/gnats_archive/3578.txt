>Release:        1.3.3
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 Intel
>Description:
Include does not work as if the text in the included file would be
directly inserted in the current file. For instance it does not seem
to work if called within a Directory section.
>How-To-Repeat:
coelho:cri(022)@palo-alto /tmp: pwd
/tmp
coelho:cri(022)@palo-alto /tmp: cat f1
<Directory /var>
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from 10.0.0.0/8
</Directory>

<Directory /tmp>
Include /tmp/f2
Allow from 10.0.0.0/8
</Directory>
coelho:cri(022)@palo-alto /tmp: cat f2
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
coelho:cri(022)@palo-alto /tmp: httpd -t -f /tmp/f1
Syntax error on line 1 of /tmp/f2:
order not allowed here
>Fix:
I had the same kind of bug when developping mod_macro and I worked around it by
not creating a new cmd_parms and entering a new srm loop but rather by 
modifying gently the configfile_t of the current cmd_parms.
