When trying to run .pl scripts I get an Internal Server Error.  The error log states
access to access to /home/rlowe/public_html/cgi-bin/banner.pl failed for usr2-40.enol.com, reason: couldn't 
spawn child process

The script works ok running it from the command line.  And has worked in the past.  I'm not aware of changing
anything.

 This is not mod_perl related, you're using mod_cgi.

 My best guess is that you're running into some resource limit, most likely
 set by a 'ulimit'.
 
 Does other scripts work under mod_cgi?
