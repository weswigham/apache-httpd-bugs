However, sounds like it might apply to any version of solaris

This is basically more details on bug ids 3189 and 4442. Note that both of
those are also under solaris.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try using DSO on solaris. And see sample source ftp:// in next section.

PS for 4442; for some reason, you sometimes get ap_palloc errors after using 
apxs to copy the .so, but if you try using dlopen on the raw .so file,
it works better.
>Fix:
There seems to be a problem with the way gcc [and possibly other compilers,
given bugID 3189]
handle strings, embedded in structs, in shared libraries.
Basically, they DON'T.

In other words, you apparently CANNOT USE

struct blah {
    int i=1;
    char label="xxx";
}

by itself in a dynamic library, and assume the char string gets set properly.
It just doesn't work.
[possibly a bug in sun 'as' ?]

I've written some sample source, at
ftp://ftp.bolthole.com/pub/apachetest.c

It demonstrates that you cannot use the current DSO methods with solaris.
[without finding some magic compile switch, anyhow]

It also shows that accessing simple 'char string[]="abcde"' DOES work
with solaris shared objects, still.

Basically, I think your whole proceedure of DSO loading/naming is horrible
anyway, and should be changed. I think it would work better if the server<->lib
interface was for the server to call some function   lib::setupstruct()
and pass in a server-allocated structure to setupstruct()
This should fix the issue with solaris shared libs.

Furthermore, under solaris at least, you can always have the init function be
the SAME NAME. So instead of that disgusting double-init stuff in httpd.conf,
you could just have

LoadModule  /path/to/module/here

and everything else would be automatic.

again, I have sample source to prove this works [at least under solaris]
ftp://ftp.bolthole.com/pub/apacheinit.c


Yes, this would mean major changes. But I think it is the Right Thing To Do.
All this just goes to show once again that Globals Are Evil, particularly
for libraries, and if you didn't use them to start with, this problem wouldn't 
be here.

 Hmm. interstingly enough, DSO *DOES* seem to work okay on a solaris 2.6 box I
 have.
 
 
 apache compile flags:
 
 ./configure --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE --enable-module=so
 --prefix=/export/scratch/apache --enable-shared=max
 
 
 (and for the record, jserv compile flags:
  ./configure --with-jsdk=/export/home/JSDK2.0
  --with-apache-install=/export/scratch/apache --prefix=/export/scratch/jserv

 After my clean build+install on the solaris 2.6 box, I went back to the 2.7
 box.
 
 I did a fresh untar of 1.3.6.
 I used the EXACT SAME FLAGS that worked on the s2.6 box:
 
 
 ./configure --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE --enable-module=so
 --prefix=/export/scratch/apache --enable-shared=max
 
 [except I used --prefix=/export/home/apache]
 
 and yes, httpd dumps core when you try to run it.
 
 SO this seems to be an issue specifically with solaris 2.7, aka 7.
 
 
 The only bugid I can find regaurding the linker under solaris 7,
 is sun bugid 106950, but that doesn't seem to be relevant.
 That is reguarding not being able to dlopen() the library.
 But the apache problem gets past dlopen.

 More details: This is looking specifically like a solaris 'as' problem.
 When I copy over a DSO install from a solaris 2.6 box, to the s7 box,
 IT WORKS!
 
 I've filed a bug report with sun.
 
 But I still don't like the way the module interface is structured :-)

 FIXED!!
 
 
 I just installed "Maintaince Update 2" on the solaris 7 box.
 That installed about 80 patches. But I'm betting it was patch
  106950-03
 
 that fixed the problem.
