>Environment:
HP-UX 9.X (Series 700 machine)
using HP's ANSI C compiler
>Description:
It appears that src/Configure *forces* RANLIB to be set to "ranlib" if it
finds it in your PATH, regardless as to whether you've set a RANLIB environmental
variable to override that or not.

With HP-UX, ranlib is redundant for Apache and doesn't need to be run.
>How-To-Repeat:
On an HP-UX 9.X system, running ranlib displays:

ranlib: ar already did it for you, see ar(1).

On an HP-UX 10.X system, you only require ranlib if you've used
"ar z" to create the .a file (which isn't the case with the Apache code).
>Fix:
Change the HP-UX section of src/Configure (about line 1100) thus:

    'HP-UX'|'HP-UX 10'|'HP-UX 11')
        RANLIB="/bin/true"
        case "$CC" in
            */cc|cc )
               ....
