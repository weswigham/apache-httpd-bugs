>Description:
RFC2616, Sec. 2.2 Specifies:

...
HTTP/1.1 header field values can be folded onto multiple lines if the continuation line begins with a space or horizontal tab. 
...

I imagine no common clients currently send a request in this fashion, but they should at least have the option of following the RFC.
>How-To-Repeat:
note <SP> is a single space:

telnet server 80
GET<CRLF>
<SP>/<CRLF>

telent server 80
GET<SP>
>Fix:
At a minimum report it back to the client as an unsupported request format.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Jun 24 20:34:03 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The "GET ..." line is not a header field, it is a "start line".  

It is impossible to be backwards compatible with HTTP/0.9 requests if you allow continuation lines on start lines.
