Standard apache installation that comes with
redhat 7.1: apache-1.3.19-5.i386.rpm

>Description:
When sending a partial-content request (i.e. resumed download), but requesting a
byte-range beyond what exists, Apache returns a 416 (Requested Range Not 
Satisfyable) as of 1.3.15.  However, the Content-Length of the response is
set to the (complete) size of the requested entity body, followed by no
entity body - causing the client to hang waiting for a body that will
never come.

This trace shows the problem (the "/" document on the test server
is 4592 bytes long):

% telnet localhost 80
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: build
Range: bytes=100000-

HTTP/1.1 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable
Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 07:34:21 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.19 (Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.1 OpenSSL/0.9.6 DAV/1.0.2 PHP/4.0.4pl1 mod_perl/1.24_01
Last-Modified: Mon, 15 Oct 2001 21:44:58 GMT
ETag: "259f2b-11f0-3bcb58da"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 4592
Content-Range: bytes */4592
Content-Type: text/html

<no body returned>

Note that the server returns a "Content-Length: 4592" header, followed by
no content.

Section 10.4.17 of RFC2616 says "When [the 416] status code is returned for a
byte-range request, the response SHOULD include a Content-Range entity-header
field specifying the current length of the selected resource."  So, the
Content-Range header generated by apache (which also indicates 4592 bytes
are available) is correct; the Content-Length header, however, causes clients
to hang as they wait for an entity body that never comes.
>How-To-Repeat:
The trace shown above works repeatably for 1.3.19+ servers when
nonexistant byte ranges are requested
>Fix:
This seems to fix it:

 Hi,
 
 4 weeks ago, I submitted this bug, and patch to fix the bug, but
 haven't seen any reply - did it get lost in the cracks? :-)
