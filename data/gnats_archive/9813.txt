>Description:
webdocsroot = /www/horde/htdocs/
under /www/horde/htdocs/nickhome/ I have an .htaccess as follows:
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://0.135.234.10/$1 [P]
(removed first octet of address)
accessing http://server/nickhome/ works as expected. however accessing
http://server/nickhome note no trainling slash, I would expect a redirect back to browser and continue as normal.  However, it errors and on the other server's logs is:
[Wed Feb 13 18:12:18 2002] [error] [client 0.144.72.97] File does not exist:  d:/apache group/apache/htdocs//www/horde/htdocs/nickhome
it has sent me the file path on the other machine as the request!!!
