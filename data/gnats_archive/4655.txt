SunOS 5.6 Ultra-Enterprise-10000
>Description:
We are using Mod_Rewrite to set up proxy connects so that URL's such as www.mysite.com/foo/bar/ proxy a connection to somewhere_behind_the_firewall.mysite.com/foo/bar/
So far so good, we then password protected www.mysite.com/foo/*
The problem was that the www.mysite.com/foo prompted for a password but if someone requested /foo/bar/ directly no password prompt is given.

Okay, we thought; lets put a rewrite rule that redirects users to the top if they havent authenticated, logging showed that %{REMOTE_USER} was always empty.
The bugbase (1687) showed someone else had this problem and that it was because rewrite is dealt with before remote_user.

This leaves the problem that we cannot password protect a system that we want to export through the firewall.

To summarise: Mod Rewrite may bypass any security that has been placed on a per directory basis.
