State-Changed-By: aaron

State-Changed-Why:
--with-module=ALL is an invalid argument.  You should use
--enable-module=ALL.  --with-module is used to add an
external module to the server.  --enable-module is used
to selectively enable or disable standard modules.

Actually, it's --enable-modules=all [plural]
