Doesn't matter, but we're using BSDI BSD/OS 2.1.
>Description:
In apache 1.2.0, code was added to http_main.c:default_server_hostnames()
that dies if it can't resolve ServerName.  It also uses the value of
gethostbyname on that name to initialize the list of virtual addresses
for the main server.  We run around 1000 apache servers for various customers, many of whom have DNS that we don't control.
Some of them change their DNS to point to servers other than ours for awhile, or their name servers become unreachable periodically (like today, when the root name servers became corrupted).
We specify BindAddress to force the IP address; we don't want ServerName used for that, because it's unreliable.  And apache should not die when there's a name server problem!  We don't want to set ServerName to an IP address because that would make redirects and imagemaps ugly for users of all our servers.
>How-To-Repeat:
In httpd.conf, put
ServerName foo.xyz
BindAddress a-valid-ipaddr-on-the-machine
>Fix:
If BindAddress is given, ServerName should be used just textually,
and not resolved

State-Changed-Why:
Please read the htdocs/manual/dns-caveats.html file that comes
with the server.  Apache absolutely requires the name of the
server to issue redirects.  You have many options to workaround
your particular problem.  I suggest that you do something like
this:

ServerName localhost
BindAddress a.b.c.d
<VirtualHost _default_>
ServerName www.foobar.com
...
</VirtualHost>

Comment-Added:
Oh yeah, I should add that the server also needs the ip address
of the "main server" to be able to figure out when to do HTTP/1.1
virtual host (non-ip) support.  The implementation is kind of
lame.  The "ServerName localhost" essentially disables this.
