>Description:
Please don't yell at me, as this isn't relavent to the latest release,
which doesn't exhibit the problem.

I'm implementing HTTP/1.1 persistant connections in Chimera-1.70, and when
hitting on Apache-1.2 [with it], everything goes well. When hitting on sites
using Apache-1.2bNN [with it], things go awry where inline images are
concerned. I can document responses from the betas that have no header.

Even though Apache-1.2bNN responds "HTTP/1.1", is the keep-alive technology
still HTTP/1.0?
>How-To-Repeat:
Get my test code of Chimera-1.70, and hit on your Web site, or www.qnx.com.

Please don't! I'm just being facetious.
A simple reply will be more than sufficient.

 Are you _sure_ you see responses from the betas without headers?  How are
 you determining that?  If you are using debugging output from Chimera,
 don't trust it.  Sniff the network to see the actual packet.  The only
 difference I can think of offhand is that in 1.2b9 there was a hack
 introduced to work around a bug in Navigator when headers are 256 or 257
 bytes long; see the src/CHANGES file for details.  This shouldn't,
 however, impact all images only certain ones where the headers are the
 wrong length.

 Apache supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 persistent connections.

State-Changed-Why:
Followup sent via email.  Since it is not a problem in
1.2.0, PR closed because we can do nothing to fix it
if it is Apache that is at fault.  Discussion of where the
exact problem is can, of course, continue...
