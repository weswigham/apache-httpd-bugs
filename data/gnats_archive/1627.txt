>Description:
If you use ProxyPass to mirror content from server A through server B, and
server A issues a redirect based on something like directory-slash completion,
server B should not pass the redirect through, but instead issue an 
"equivalent" redirect for the mirrored resource on B.

For example, imagine the following in server B's config file:

  ProxyPass /Bpath http://A/Apath

Now imagine a request coming in to server B as follows:

  GET /Bpath HTTP/1.0

B proxies this request over to server A as follows:

  GET /Apath HTTP/1.0

A returns a redirect, since "Apath" is really a directory

  302 Moved Temporarily
  Location: http://A/Apath/

Which server B returns verbatim:

  302 Moved Temporarily
  Location: http://A/Apath/

It would be "ideal" if B returned the location of the mirrored resource on
B rather than on A.  E.g.:

  302 Moved Temporarily
  Location: http://B/Bpath/

Of course if the redirect wasn't under the ProxyPass-mirrored directory, it
should just be relayed verbatim.

State-Changed-Why:
This functionality is now provided by ProxyPassReverse
which was introduced for Apache 1.3b6 by me.
Then you just can use:

   ProxyPass        /Bpath http://A/Apath
   ProxyPassReverse /Bpath http://A/Apath

and the redirects are automatically
rewritten to again flow through the proxy.
This feature was actually introduced because
for a dedicated Reverse Proxy this functionality
is essential.
