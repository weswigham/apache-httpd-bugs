>Description:
I've set two other directory outside the apache tree directory using Alias
eg: Alias test "c:/dev/system"

I did not touch the <Directory> directives yet.
It works fine with html page.
When I tried to execute a page with php3, it give an error like this..
"Cannot locate c:\apache\htdocs\/test/test.php3 input=0, null"

I try to add a directory, no good.

Can somebody help me so that the file in that directory can be use to run php scripting as well as other file under htdocs.
