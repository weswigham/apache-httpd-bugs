>Description:

When running ./buildconf from within the src directory, and libtoolize is not in the current path, error reporting could use some help. Minor issue, but could be confusing for some. 

[jeff@host src]$ ./buildconf
dirname: too few arguments
Try `dirname --help' for more information.
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/../share/aclocal/libtool.m4', needed by `aclocal.m4'.  Stop.
make: *** [all] Error 2
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to run ./buildconf without libtoolize in the current path.
>Fix:
Perhaps add some error checking in src/build/build.mk near:

generated_lists:
        @echo config_m4_files = `find . -name config.m4` > $@
        @n=`helpers/PrintPath libtoolize`; echo libtool_prefix = `dirname $$n`/.. >> $@
