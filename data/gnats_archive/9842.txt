>Description:
In build: httpd-2.0_20020217051215
modules/ssl/ssl_engine_mutex.c:74 has SSL_LOG_CRIT undefined in
function : ssl_log(s, SSL_LOG_CRIT|SSL_ADD_ERRNO, ...)
compiled with SSL_LOG_MASK instead ? Works fine when I do that.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
either define SSL_LOG_CRIT or just use SSL_LOG_MASK or define custom mask
