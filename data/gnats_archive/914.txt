>Description:
When using ProxyBlock:
Sometimes (apparently) FTP proxying is handled with http.
It is possible for the function proxy_http_handler to be called with
a URL that does not start with "http://". However, the code does a
url += 7 to skip the first 7 chars of the url when it is trying to get
the desthost. This doesn't work well when the url starts with "ftp://"

There may be other places as well.
