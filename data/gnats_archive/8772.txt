>Description:
I upgrade from 2.0.16 beta to 2.0.28-dev from CVS about two weeks ago and have update to 2.0.28 beta a few days ago.

Both 2.0.28 versions just ignore the SSI command #exec cmd="/bin/foo" in the way, that it's just absorbed. Neither in the error log nor in the documentation /bug database I found a note on this strange behaviour. Also a fast look over the diff on both mod_include.c versions didn't help (at least to me :-). And the only thing, I found in the CHANGES file I was an entry which states, that SSI command #exec *cgi* has been changed to work also on win32 platforms, but not the #exec cmd command.

The SSI command #exec cgi="/cgi-bin/foo.cgi" still does work.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://cip117.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/ doesn't show the two "uname -foo" commands embedded in the page since I update from 2.0.16 to 2.0.28-dev on that machine. But the fortune-like CGI script (embedded via #exec cgi) issuing another joke or saying on each request still works fine. (This server is just for playing around and not for performance. It will probably disappear at the end of the year. :-)

I have been unable to reproduce this problem on Linux 2.4.  Can you give me a more specific test case?

 Here's where we are going wrong.  #exec cmd="/bin/uname" should work just fine.
 #exec cmd="/bin/uname -foo" is probably what's broken.
 
 That feature was broken forever and a year, if you query for ssi exec and suexec
 you will see this bug repeated over and over.
 
 We probably need to review the syntax overall, since the argv[0]/command are now
 based on a literal interpretation of the cmd or (filesystem mapped) cgi argument.
 
 Good catch, thanks for mentioning that 'argument' in the note.
 
 Bill

 Sorry, but it doesn't. The mentioned page
 
 	http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/
 
 now has the three following commands and none of them works, all are
 absorbed:
 
 <!--#exec cmd="/usr/bin/uname -rs" -->
 <!--#exec cmd="/usr/bin/uname -m" -->
 <!--#exec cmd="/usr/bin/uname" -->
 
 I set up a special page for this PR at
 
 	http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/8772.shtml,
 
 where all the mentioned issues are shown. There you also can get all
 source codes of the used SSI documents and the used CGI script.
 
 There is another problem reagrding SSIs which is mentioned on that
 page and especially on the two pages
 
 	http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/8772-2.shtml and
 	http://xcip3.studcs.uni-sb.de:8042/8772-3.shtml.
 
 The output of the three CGI date variables seems to some format string
 errors and contain binary garbage or values of other variables, and
 that depends somehow on if there are #exec or #printenv in the SSI
 file or not.
 
 HTH.

State-Changed-Why:
I have just fixed this in the CVS tree.  I tried it with
all of the examples in the report as well as some of
my own examples.

Before my patch, we were trying to take the command line
from the r->filename variable, instead of using the program
name from the SSI tag. My patch fixes this problem, and we
now use the correct value for the command line.

This will be available in the next version of Apache 2.0,
thank you for the bug report.
