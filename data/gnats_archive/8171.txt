>Description:
When configuring ErrorDocument directives i found that there was a problem using documents contained in a folder called error, ie.

ErrorDocument /error/404.html

gets ignored, but

ErrorDocument /errordocs/404.html

works

Its not really a bug - but some documentation may help for any other users

State-Changed-Why:

I'm fairly certain that there was something else you
missed here, because Apache has no problem at all
with ErrorDocument's pointing at /error or 
anything else.

Thanks for using Apache!
