SERVER_BUILT is used in mod_example, and within conditional code

grep over the source tree for it.  (I'm using the CVS tarball of 26Sep97, or

State-Changed-Why:
The symbol is defined and initialised by buildmark.c,
which is dynamically created at link time.  If your
make succeeds, you'll find the file in the src directory.

 No, this is Windows.  This currently doesn't work under Windows and needs
 to be fixed before the next release.
 
 In any case, it is not really appropriate to submit PRs about
 unreleased versions without following the mailing list for discussion
 of the issue there.  This has been discussed and is a known issue
 that needs to be resolved.  If you look closely, you would note
 that the Makefile creates it on Unix platforms but NT is too limited
 to be able to do that, so something else is needed.

State-Changed-Why:
In the current development source it is declared as

extern API_VAR_EXPORT time_t restart_time;

and API_VAR_EXPORT is declared:

#ifdef IS_MODULE
# define API_VAR_EXPORT         __declspec(dllimport)
#else
# define API_VAR_EXPORT    SERVER_BUILT is extern, but nothing else
