>Description:
When MSIE 5.0 bookmarks a page, it requests favicon.ico.
Since this file does not exist, it adds a line to error_log.
>How-To-Repeat:
Taint yourself by using MSIE 5.0 to bookmark a page from your server.
Wash your hands.
grep favicon.ico error_log
>Fix:
Yes.  Shrink apache.ico from 32*32 to 16*16 (with 16 colors) and
save it as favicon.ico.  Sorry, I do not know in which
directories MSIE 5.0 searches for favicon.ico .

State-Changed-Why:

We have enough problems with administrators reinstalling,
ticking off users with the default "it worked" page.  The
administrator needs to do this.

And the apache.ico is now both 32x32 and 16x16, so this
works today, if that's the result you want.
