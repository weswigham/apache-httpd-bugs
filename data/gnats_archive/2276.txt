Any. (new feature)	
>Description:
DNS address is interesting but not 'canonical' enough for flow based
charging and reconciliation. 10% + of hosts don't have DNS names, and
of those that do, a significant number can't be reverse-looked up to their
IP address within 1 week of being used (dynamic pools etc)

I have therefore modified mod_log_config.c to include a new  %I directive
to log the IP address, which is held in the r_>connection block anyway.

The code is very simple.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Here is the code:  add to log_item_keys

    { 'I', log_remote_addr, 0 },

and add to the function lists
char *log_remote_addr (request_rec *r, char *a)
{
   char dummy[16];

   return pstrdup(r->pool, inet_ntoa(r->connection->remote_addr.sin_addr));
};

It just works! I'm using this with a modified filter on analog to parse
common logformat files, and sort/grade using IP address while still being
able to count DNS name

A similar patch has already been added to Apache 1.3
(the IP address can be access via "%a").

Thanks for using Apache.
