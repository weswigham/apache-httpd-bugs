Linux RedHat5.0, i586, kernal 2.0.32
gcc version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
I've read all the faqs, searched dejanews, and search apache bug list

this should be staightforward, I have triple checked all the config files but whenever
httpd tries to serve a page . . .
netscape say "Document contain no data"
lynx say "unexpected network read error: connection aborted"
error_log say "httpd: caught SIGSEGV, attempting to dump core in /usr/local/apache"

if I telnet to "locahost 80" and "GET http:/localhost/ HTTP/1.0"
httpd say "403 error, don't have permission"

in httpd.conf
user = nobody
group = users

permissions in /usr/local/apache/htdocs are 666, user=root,group=users

I have installed new versions of linuxthreads, glibc, libc
Apache was compiled with -lcrypt flag set

I don't know for sure if this is a software bug, but I have never had trouble
like this before using apache.  There is no core dump to send.

Please help or tell me what I may have done wrong
>How-To-Repeat:
I've using vanilla RedHat5.0.  There are new glib,libc, and linuxthreads installed
>Fix:
Maybe these libraries are messing something up.  I had trouble running some other applications
until I upgrade libc,glibc.  Now I'm wondering if these are affecting apache.  Could someone
tell me if the newest versions work ok with apache

 I don't have any redhat 5.0 systems to test on because I don't trust them
 to be stable yet.  The latest versions should work with apache, if they
 don't then it's likely a redhat or glibc bug.  You may need to recompile
 apache... have you tried that?
