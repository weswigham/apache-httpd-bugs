>Environment:
AIX 4.2, tried with xlc and egcs-1.1.2
>Description:
If I configure modules like mod_alias, mod_include, mod_rewrite or mod_setenvif
as shared objects, silenty the wrong regexec (that from libc) is used and thus
regular expressions don't work.

I added some debugging outputs to src/regex/regexec.c and they were only printed
when the module was loaded with --disable-shared=mod_alias
>How-To-Repeat:
I configured with
./configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max
and
./configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max \
--disable-shared=alias --disable-shared=include --disable-shared=rewrite --disable-shared=setenvif
