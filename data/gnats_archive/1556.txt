>Description:
Using a vanilla NCSA authorization with a 'deny from all' for the doc
root directory in access.conf, and an .htaccess in the target dirctory
which contains:

AuthName 6FlagsBook
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/users
require valid-user
satisfy any                       

it takes multiple tries to get authenticated on Netscape 3.02 or IE 3.02.
The second or third try gets the pages, or some of them. If the second
gets some the third gets all.

Netscape Communicator seems to be okay in this respect.

I wonder if there's a compatability issue.

I just installed and am trialing Apache, so I have no sense of how prior
releases worked.

State-Changed-Why:
My guess is that you're visiting your server with a name
like "foo" where the server is called "foo.blah.hp.com" and
then later you end up on a page that has the full name.  You
have to authenticate to both of these.  This is a client issue
that Apache has no control over.  Is that the case?
