>Environment:
SunOS 5.6, gcc, mod_jserv.c
>Description:
My configuration is using multiple Listen directives.  After a server restart
(SIGHUP) I've noticed that the JVM started by mod_jserv.c inherits the listening
sockets from the apache process.  This doesn't happen when apache is initially
started, i.e. before the first SIGHUP.

The problem should also be visible with other process forked by apache, for
example cgi programms.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The problem is in http_main.c.  When multiple Listen directives are used, the
listeners pointer is != NULL.  At the top of the do until loop in
standalone_main, copy_listeners() is called which removes the fd cleanup for
each listening socket via a call to kill_cleanup_for_fd().  Later in the do
until loop, find_listener() is called which may return a valid socket >= 0 for
reuse after the server re-start.  Note that these re-used sockets found by
find_listener() do not get an fd_cleanup installed!

The following diffs contain a fix:

                FD_SET (fd, &listenfds);
                if (fd > listenmaxfd) listenmaxfd = fd;
                lr->fd = fd;
