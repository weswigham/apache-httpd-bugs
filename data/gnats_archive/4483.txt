>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 / JDK 1.1.5
>Description:
I would like to be able to debug servlets running within the JServ environment.
Theoretically this should be possible by using the debug java VM with the
-debug argument, since the VM then outputs an agent password that can be used
to attach jdb with. I had hoped that the password would be written to one of
the log files, but this doesn't happen.

I can't easily work around the problem using the HttpServer class, for example,
because I am running a number of specialist servlets such as GNUJSP that
require the full capabilities of Apache. In any case, I would like to be able
to test directly in the environment that I will use in production.
>How-To-Repeat:
In jserv.properties:
wrapper.bin=java_g
wrapper.bin.parameters=-debug

(Note that if you try wrapper.bin=java (ie the non-debugging VM) then you
can see the exception thrown due to the rejection of the -debug option)
>Fix:
1. Be able to direct the output from the debugging java VM, in particular the
agent password, into a file or to the screen at startup.
2. A debug mode in jserv that would do all this automatically?
