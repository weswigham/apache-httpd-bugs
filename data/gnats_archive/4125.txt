Patchlevel & compiler?? As downloaded from here
>Description:
I've started to have a DOS window appear on my desktop when Apache is started up, whether done manually or from Services menu.
This window doesn't want to die, and resists all attempts to kill it. Is there any way of 
stopping this from happening? If so, how? Is this where I should be able to log in to the server?
>How-To-Repeat:
I have no idea - try stopping and starting Apache a few times from the services menu..
>Fix:

State-Changed-Why:
I believe this bug has been addressed.  If you continue
to experience problems using the 1.3.12 product, the
forthcoming 1.3.13 release has some significant overhaul
of running services under Win32.
