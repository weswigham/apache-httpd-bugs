>Description:
Our product uses Apache's proxy module and rewrite module to implement proxy funcationality, when we did load testing with Silk Performer we found this problem. When we made multiple concurrent requests from Silk Performer to Apache's proxy module with rewrite rules, Silk Performer finally gave 
"error HTTP: 1000 - invalid header, RecvHeader second attempt" error. When I took out rewrite rules from proxy module and did the same load testing, it worked fine.

>How-To-Repeat:
Add new proxy module by adding the follwing lines to httpd.conf:

Listen 9000

<VirtualHost our.company.com:9000>
	ProxyRequests On

	ProxyVia On
	CacheRoot "c:/apache/proxy"
	CacheSize 5
	CacheGcInterval 4
	CacheMaxExpire 24
	CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
	CacheDefaultExpire 1

	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteLog c:/apache/logs/rewrite.log
	RewriteLogLevel 9
	RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}   !^our\.company\.com
	# Use [P] to proxy/rewrite, [R] for a URL-decoration type rewrite
	RewriteRule ^proxy:(.+) $1 [P]
</VirtualHost>

In Silk Performer, add script which makes request to http://www.google.com through proxy server - our.company.com:9000

Start the test with multiple concurrent users and each user keeps making requests for 2 mintues, then you will get HTTP error after some sucessful requests.

State-Changed-Why:
Why are you load testing google's servers?  That doesn't seem very polite.

What does the error you are getting actually mean?  We have no idea what your load testing utility means when it gives that error.

What makes you think this is anything more than intermittent connectivity issues reaching google when you are stressing your internet connection while bombarding it with requests?

 Actually I used our local web server for load testing, I just gave 
 www.google.com as the example when I submitted the issue, sorry for the 
 confusion.
 
 I have tried out 2.3.14 for Win32 and 2.3.17 for Solaris, this problem 
 doesn't exist. This is why I thought it is a bug of 2.3.19 for Win32.
 
 Since I also don't know what that info from Silk Performer means, so I 
 reproduced the bug using a simple java application successfully, the 
 following are steps:
 
 1. Add the following lines to httpd.conf to create a new proxy module:
 
   Listen 9000
 
   <VirtualHost zhao.mycompany.com:9000>
 	ProxyRequests On
 
 	ProxyVia On
 	CacheRoot "c:/apache/proxy"
 	CacheSize 5
 	CacheGcInterval 4
 	CacheMaxExpire 24
 	CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
 	CacheDefaultExpire 1
 
 	RewriteEngine On
 	RewriteLog c:/apache/logs/rewrite.log
 	RewriteLogLevel 9
 	RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}   !^zhao\.mycompany\.com
 	# Use [P] to proxy/rewrite, [R] for a URL-decoration type rewrite
 	RewriteRule ^proxy:(.+)    $1 [P]
 </VirtualHost>
 
 
 2. Restart Apache service.
 
 3. Create the following Java application which can make multiple concurrent 
 requests to the proxy, the source code are as follows:
 
 import java.util.*;
 import java.io.*;
 import java.net.*;
 
 public class HTTPPerformer
 {
   private static int numberOfThreads;
 
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     try
     {
       //Use proxy server to get pages
       System.setProperty("http.proxyHost", "zhao.mycompany.com");
       System.setProperty("http.proxyPort", "9000");
 
       numberOfThreads = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
       multiThreadTest();
     }
     catch (Exception e)
     {
       System.out.println("Exception in main: " + e);
       e.printStackTrace();
     }
   }
 
   private static void multiThreadTest()
   {
     for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++)
     {
       MyThread myT = new MyThread(i);
       Thread t = new Thread(myT);
       t.start();
     }
   }
 
   static class MyThread implements Runnable
   {
     int counter;
 
     public MyThread(int i)
     {
       counter = i;
     }
 
     public void run()
     {
       try
       {
 	String uri = "http://zhao.mycompany.com/load_testing.htm";
         URL url = new URL( uri );
         URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
         InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
         int b = is.read();
         while (b!=-1)
         {
           b = is.read();
         }
 	System.out.println("Get the page successfully.");
         is.close();
       }
       catch (Exception e)
       {
         System.out.println(e);
         e.printStackTrace();
       }
     }
   }
 }
 
 4. Compile the Java application and run it, and the following are results 
 from my console:
 
 C:\temp>java HTTPPerformer 1
 Get the page successfully.
 
 C:\temp>java HTTPPerformer 2
 Get the page successfully.
 Get the page successfully.
 
 C:\temp>java HTTPPerformer 3
 Get the page successfully.
 Get the page successfully.
 Get the page successfully.
 
 C:\temp>java HTTPPerformer 4

 5. The above results show that when there are many concurrent requests made 
 to the proxy, the socket connections are suddenly reset by Apache server 
 proxy module.
 
 6. I followed the above steps with Apache Server 2.3.14 for Win32, and it 
 worked fine.
