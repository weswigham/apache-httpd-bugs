>Description:
In managing a number of different web sites, the status module provides
information to spot problems.  However, the different sites run different
versions of the Apache web server which sometimes is confusing to the poor
systems administrator.

With the addition of 2 lines of code, this information is easily provided
in the status display and really does help out.
