>Description:
Possibly related to PR 1644:

Apache adds the following header to an HTTP request:

  Vary: Host, Host

Apache should only output "Vary: Host", and should not duplicate
multiple fields.

This occurs with the mod_rewrite rule of:

RewriteCond   %{ENV:WasFound}  !^yes$
RewriteCond   %{HTTP_HOST}  !^$
RewriteCond   ${lc:%{HTTP_HOST}}  ^www\.(.+)\.(the)([^\.])([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$  [OR,NC]
RewriteCond   ${lc:%{HTTP_HOST}}  ^(.+)\.(the)([^\.])([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$       [OR,NC]
RewriteCond   ${lc:%{HTTP_HOST}}  ^www\.(.+)\.()([^\.])([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$     [OR,NC]
RewriteCond   ${lc:%{HTTP_HOST}}  ^(.+)\.()([^\.])([^\.]+)\.([^\.]+)$
RewriteCond   /home/restrict/vhosts/%3/%2%3%4.%5/%1.%2%3%4.%5%{REQUEST_FILENAME}  -f [OR]
RewriteCond   /home/restrict/vhosts/%3/%2%3%4.%5/%1.%2%3%4.%5%{REQUEST_FILENAME}  -d [OR]
RewriteCond   /home/restrict/vhosts/%3/%2%3%4.%5/%1.%2%3%4.%5/.htaccess -f
RewriteRule   ^/(.*)$   /home/restrict/vhosts/%3/%2%3%4.%5/%1.%2%3%4.%5/$1  [E=VHOST:%1.%2%3%4.%5,L,E=WasFound:yes]

My theory is that, because multiple "HTTP_HOST" fields appear
in the RewriteCond, apache adds one "Host" entry for each "and"ed
RewriteCond (but not for the "or"s).
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a mod_rewrite rule with somthing like the above, that
has multiple HTTP_HOST checks.
>Fix:
Problem Report 1644 is listed as still open, which leads me to
believe that this issue is being worked on.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Tue Apr 20 12:51:58 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Yeah but it's technically correct to send duplicate Host
tokens... to fix it would require a sort or other more complicated
structure... which is in my opinion a total waste of time.
Also I doubt anyone actually uses Vary given that nobody
(not even apache) implements it properly.
