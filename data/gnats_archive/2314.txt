>Description:
I would like to be able to specify wildcards or regexps in ProxyRemote         
directive. Like this:                                                          
                                                                               
ProxyRemote http://*.some.domain http://proxy.for.domain:port                  
ProxyRemote * http://generic.proxy:port                                        
                                                                               
I think making this can be as easy as changing strncasecmp to fnmatch.         
A more generic approach would be using regular expressions.
