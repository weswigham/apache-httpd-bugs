Please Help:

A page that says "It Worked" keeps coming up instead of my index page
and the ISP person (Yuuki Lau 1-612-333-1505) cannot figure out how to
fix it. I am the site owner and I do not understand the issues but Yuuki
does, and he will help if you will please contact him. I will pay you to
help solve this problem just let me know what the charges are. Thank You.

>How-To-Repeat:
At the moment, EVERYONE signed on to America Online is going to the wrong page.
>Fix:
I am sure Yuuki and other tech support staff at Winternet have
tried to fix the problem. At this point the situation has become
an emergency because people who have paid fees are unable to get in.

State-Changed-Why:

The problem is probably that the file you're changing, and
that you think is your main site page, is not the one the
server has been told is the front door.  Check your *.conf
files for the settings of the 'DocumentRoot' and
'AccessFileName' directives.  Those probably point to
the htdocs/index.html file under where the server kit
was unpacked.  Either change *that* index.html, or
(preferably) change the DocumentRoot to point to the
directory where you want your content to be, and restart
the server.

No charge. :-)
