Windows NT 4.0, SP6a,  MS Visual C++ ver 6
>Description:
Recently installed Apache, for the first time, and it appears to work fine.
I need to install SSL (openssl-9.5).  It requires the patch utility to apply the
patch.   I found patch for Unix(GNU) but where can I find patch for NT?
Or is there a better way ,short of installing it on Unix.  That is not an option.
