>Description:
PR#817 and PR#920's solutions, as implemented, mean that it no longer works 
to have DocumentRoot on a partition automounted with the 4.4BSD automounter.

The src/CHANGES file says:

>    *) If a htaccess file can not be read due to bad permissions, deny
>       access to the directory with a HTTP_FORBIDDEN.  The previous
>       behavior was to ignore the htaccess file if it could not
>       be read.  This change may make some setups with unreadable
>       htaccess files stop working.  PR#817  [Marc Slemko]

PR#920 advises searching for .htaccess files all the way down from the
root directory, and it seems to have been implemented.

I am using NetBSD-current, and I find that whereas v1.2b10
worked for me, 1.3b2 doesn't.

My setup has

DocumentRoot /vol/www/
/vol is the mount-point created by AMD, the automounter daemon.

It's interesting that the .htaccess file that gives "Permission
denied" error is /vol/.htaccess.  (One appears not to be able to access
non-existant files directly in /vol/., and the error you get back is not
ENOENT or ENOTDIR, but "Permission denied" (EACCES).)  One is not allowed
to create files in the automount-point directory, so there's no obvious way
round this without changing the code.


>How-To-Repeat:
On a system running the Berkeley automounter, such as NetBSD, create for example:
/etc/amd/vol with the one line:
www	rhost:=somehost;rfs:=/path/to/docroot/www
referring to a host "somehost" that has that /path/to/docroot/www available.

Start amd: "amd /vol /etc/amd/vol"

Check you can see /vol/www by doing "ls /vol/www".
Start Apache-1.3b2 with a file set that specifies DocumentRoot as /vol/www.
Then try to access any file, for instance GET /, and you will see an error
in error_log:
[Mon Oct 20 17:52:21 1997] [crit] (13)Permission denied: /vol/.htaccess \
	pfopen: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable
>Fix:
Not easy, as this is caused by the conflict of two desirable features.
Checking for the error occuring in an automounter mount point would be cludgy.
Checking with stat(2) doesn't help; you still get Permission denied.  This 
could be considered a bug in the automounter, because stat isn't supposed to
require the existance or any permissions on the file, but the path has to be searchable.

State-Changed-Why:
Automounting is annoying; I would probably agree that this
is a bug in the automounter, however there may be other
issues that force this bug or "feature" to be present.

You should, however, be able to work around it by
something like:

<Directory />
AllowOverride none
</Directory>
<Directory /vol/www>
AllowOverride whateveryouwant
</Directory>

If you have AllowOverride None set, then Apache shouldn't
be searching for .htaccess files.  It is a config related performance
improvement that should fix your problem.  If not, let
us know.

 Marc,
 
 You suggested:
 
 >  <Directory />
 >  AllowOverride none
 >  </Directory>
 >  <Directory /vol/www>
 >  AllowOverride whateveryouwant
 >  </Directory>
 
 This works for me, allowing me to have DocumentRoot on the automounted
 partition.  Thanks so much for your quick and helpful response.
