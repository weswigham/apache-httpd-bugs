The same configure option on a Red Hat Linux 6.0 system works fine.
Compiling statically on HPUX works also fine but I don't want to
recompile
the whole stuff (SSL+PHP+FastCGI+JServ+etc.) when I just want to add or
update a new module.

The key is modifying the src/os/unix/os.c file so that HPUX11 is
allowed. If you look at your defines in your Makefile, you see it shows
-DHPUX11. However, the os.c program only allows HPUX and HPUX10. So, I
just added "|| defined(HPUX11)" to each occurrence in the os.c file. The
diff looks like the following:

100c100
< #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10) || defined(HPUX11)
---
> #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10)
123c123
< #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10) || defined(HPUX11)
---
> #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10)
138c138
< #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10) || defined(HPUX11)
---
> #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10)
174c174
< #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10) || defined(HPUX11)
---
> #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10)

Once I did this, things compiled nicely and apache seems to work fine.
