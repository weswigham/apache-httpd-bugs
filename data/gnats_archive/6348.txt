>Description:
Customised errordocuments for 302 errorcode (i.e. documents that should 
redirect the client to a new location) does not include a Location
header and does therefore not work. The new location is not provided in
an environment variable either, making it impossible to write scripts to
handle the redirection message.
>How-To-Repeat:
In httpd.conf:
ErrorDocument 302 /errors/code302.html

/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi:
#!/bin/sh
echo "Location: /index.html
echo
echo

/errors/code302.html:
<html><head><title>redir</title></head>
<body><h1>redir</h1></body></html>

Then try http://server/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi and weep
>Fix:
This patch seems to fix it:
