>Description:
The Polish translation of index.html.po.iso-pl included in 1.3.14 is very bad. 
It is hardly Polish language at all. Looks so funny that was posted on 
a newsgroup pl.rec.humor.najlepsze as a joke: Message-ID: <8pvpl0$5lk$1@news.tpi.pl>
2.0a7 does not contain this Polish file at all, so I understand it is not fixed
yet.

I have written to the author of the previous translation (mihau@mihau.de) - he
agreed with me that it was not good and suggested me to send the fixed file to
Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Get a Polish native speaker (having a grandmother from Poland is not enough),
show the page and wait for effect.
>Fix:
I can send you the re-translated file index.html.po.iso-pl, please give me
address to which I should send.

 I have sent the retranslated file to slive@apache.org.
 I have changed the filename from index.html.po.iso-pl to index.html.pl
 (I have named it in the same convention all other national index.html
 files in the htdocs directory).
 Let me know if you have any problems with the new file.

 Marta Bartnicka.

 This has been committed and will be available in the next release
 of Apache 1.3.  I changed the filename extension back to .po.iso-pl
 because we have an
 AddLanguage pl .po
 AddCharset ISO-8859-2 .iso-pl
 in the default httpd.conf.  I believe this was done to avoid conflicts
 with Perl .pl files.  (In fact, your email to me was marked as
 a Perl script.)
