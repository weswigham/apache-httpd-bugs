>Description:

A certain combination of "Accept: " header line tokens caused an error in
various versions of Apache, ranging from 1.3.20, 1.3.22 till the latest
ones.

If the GET request headers contains the following Accept line:

Accept: text/xml, application/xml, application/xhtml+xml, text/html;q=0.9, image/png

apache will fail to serve the client with the error page saying "Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.
Request header field is missing colon separator."

At the same time, when we issue a request without the first type (text/xml),
the daemon WILL serve the client:

Accept: application/xml, application/xhtml+xml, text/html;q=0.9, image/png

This is certainly a misbihavor of parser code.

P.S. This kind of Accept header line is issued by recent versions of Mozilla.

Fix the header line parser. I have not checked the code yet and have no

State-Changed-Why:
You get a 400 error if you place /png on a line by
itself.  This is valid RFC2616 behavior.  If all of
the Accept tokens are on one line or has a valid
MIME-continuation character (leading space or tab),
it will treat it as one value.

I tested your case on the current Apache 2.0 build on
www.apache.org and it presented the correct behavior.
