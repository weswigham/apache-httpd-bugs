>Release:        1.2.x
>Environment:
Linux 2.0.29, Slackware 96 and RedHat 4.1
>Description:
To my dismay, every version of 1.2 I have compiled and installed turns
out to be 40-50% slower than 1.1.3 - I have been using the Zeusbench
program as a benchmark - whether I use 1 connection or 100 concurrent
connections, small files or large files, 1 request for the file or
several hundred requests, whether I request keep-alive or not, 1.2.x 
clocks in 40-50% slower than 1.1.3.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply download zeusbench from www.zeus.co.uk/products/server
and compare apache 1.1 to 1.2 on any system 
>Fix:
Not yet - I'm amazed that nobody's mentioned this earlie

What modules are you using?  Is this with simple HTML
