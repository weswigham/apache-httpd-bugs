Linux 2.0.33 alpha unknown
gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
>Description:
when I fixed the "make r" (see other problem report (no no. assigned, yet),
in the src/regex dir, it gave me:
./re <tests
314: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
318: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
319: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
320: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
344: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'

419: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
420: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
421: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
468: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
472: ERE exec error REG_NOMATCH, 26/100 `regexec() failed to match'
make: *** [r] Error 1

I found this bug reported on a osf (PR number 3632), but this was for
version 1.3.3 and on osf.
>How-To-Repeat:
tar xzf apache_1.3.6.tgz; cd apache_1.3.6; ./configure; make; cd src/regex; 
mv debug.c debug.c-old; sed -e 's/ap_isprint/ap_snprintf/' debug.c-old > debug.c;
make r
on an axp/alpha running linux, at least.
>Fix:
It may have to do with 64bit-cleanness of hsregex. But I'm not a c-programmer,
so I can only hope, somebody will find this useful...

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rse
State-Changed-When: Tue Jun 29 07:13:22 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
The problem just is that
s/ap_isprint/ap_snprintf/ is incorrect.
It's now fixed and passes the test suite.
