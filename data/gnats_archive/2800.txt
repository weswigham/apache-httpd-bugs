>Environment:
not relevant, it's a java source bug
>Description:
Here is the existing code in org.apache.jserv.JServUtils.encodeCookie:

        ...
        int age = cookie.getMaxAge();
        if ( cookie.getMaxAge() > 0 ) {
            buf.append( "; expires=" );
            buf.append( cookieDate.format(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + age * 1000)));
        } else if ( cookie.getMaxAge() == 0 ) {
        ...

The multiplication of the int by 1000 causes integer overflow.

History: this problem was detected by Sean Hammon (sean-h@mailhost) in a post to   java-apache-users in early June; I added the analysis of the problem and suggested fix.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use a cookie expiration time of about 25 days,

25 days in milliseconds:  25*3600*24*1000 = 2160000000
Integer.MAX_INT: 0x7fffffff = 2^31-1=       2147483647
>Fix:
This should be changed to use long (64-bit) arithmetic, for instance

         ...
       long age = cookie.getMaxAge();
        if ( age > 0 ) {
            buf.append( "; expires=" );
            buf.append( cookieDate.format(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + age * 1000)));
        } else if ( age == 0 ) {
        ...
