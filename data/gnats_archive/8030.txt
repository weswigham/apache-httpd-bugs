>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Prof. with Apache 1.3.20-win32, AMD K6 400 MHZ with 128 Mb
>Description:
I have tested all possibilities to configure a Virtual Host and
these are the outputs from the err.log file:

[Warn] NameVirtualHost server:80 has no VirtualHosts
[Warn] NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts
[error] Cannot resolve host name server --- ignoring!
>How-To-Repeat:
just uncomment the last lines in the file httpd.conf
>Fix:
Yes I have! Because the config-files are not clear and hard to adjust, you get a lot of bug reports which actually could be solved by the means of a small utility to configure the server. This would please many users and from the other hand would reduce the amount of bug reports dramatically which eventually will reduce lots of headaches from you.

State-Changed-Why:
I can assure you that virtualhosts work just fine.  I see no evidence of any bug in Apache here; your configuration problem would best be addressed in a non-bug-reporting forum, such as the appropriate Usenet newsgroup.

It is impossible for me to even give a basic suggestion, since you don't even include the configurations you have tried, but the fact that your webserver claims not to be able to resolve the name "server" may well be the cause of your problem; you can't just make up names, they have to be in DNS.
