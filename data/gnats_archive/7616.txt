>Description:
Running a cluster of 4 Apache servers, all connected via NFS to a file server.
Every once in a while, apache will return a 404, and a

"File does not exist: /usr1/wrouweb/www/psremote.jpg" in the error log

The file does exist, but something cause apache to think it didnt, future requests to this file (and others like it) are successful.
>How-To-Repeat:
unknown
>Fix:
Make sure the file really doesnt exist, or return the errno in the error log so admins can find the actual cause of the file not found.
