>Description:
When I wanted to switch ot mod_vhost_alias instead of using hundreds of
<virtualhost> s ,I run into the following problem - It doesn't process
my RewriteRules ,etc.Here is the config :


UseCanonicalName off
LogFormat "%V %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b" vcommon
CustomLog /var/log/apache/vhost.log vcommon
RewriteEngine ON 
RewriteLogLevel 9
RewriteLog /var/log/apache/rw.log
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^http://%{HTTP_HOST}/ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /*.htm$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /*.html$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /*/$
RewriteRule ^/* - [NS,L]
RewriteRule ^/* http://%{HTTP_HOST}/ [NS,F,L]
VirtualDocumentRoot /www/%0


And there isn't anything in rw.log - It just doesn't do anything...
>How-To-Repeat:
no URL for this at the moment,it's not easy visible through the web.
>Fix:
To process everything about mod_rewrite before mod_vhost_alias probably ?

State-Changed-Why:
I can't duplicate this problem using the configuration
directives that you included. I do get output in my
rewrite log indicating that it is working. Perhaps
your src/Configuration file has mod_vhost_alias and
mod_rewrite in a strange order.
