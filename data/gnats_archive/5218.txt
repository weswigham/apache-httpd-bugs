>Environment:
SunOS sun1 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5,10
>Description:
We have several 1 - 2MB swf files on our website.  Normally these files download fine to end-users.  However, very rarely they download incompletely.  When this happens, the access_log records a status of 200 and the number of bits transfered as the number of bits actually transfered instead of the file size.  It appears that there are two problems here --

1)  Occationally the files do not transfer completely.
2)  I believe when the do not transfer completely, a status of 206 should show up instead of status 200.
>How-To-Repeat:
It is a speratic problem which I cannot reliably reproduce.  So it is hard for me to give you specific information here.  
>Fix:
I do not know.  However, I am willing to help in any way which is useful.  Please let me know what I can do.

State-Changed-Why:
Why do you think a 206 should show up?  A 206 only shows up
if the client only requests part of the file.

There is nothing at all unusual about a client aborting
the download of a several megabyte file in the middle.
Why do you think your log entries indicate a problem
with Apache?
