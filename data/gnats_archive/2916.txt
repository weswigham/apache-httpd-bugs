>Description:
Ok, I am doing a make depend as I need to compile in a mod_auth_mysql module which I obtained from the mysql site (http://www.tcx.se) it failed in make depend so I tried to do it during a base install (no modules that don't come with apache source code) and it still fails:
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/apache_1.3.1/src/ap'
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/apache_1.3.1/src/main'
cp Makefile.tmpl Makefile.tmpl.bak \ && sed -ne '1,/^# DO NOT REMOVE/p' Makefile.tmpl > Makefile.new \
&& gcc -MM  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DLINUX=2 -DSTATUS -DUSE_HSREGEX  *.c >> Makefile.new \_&& sed -e '1,$s: ../include/: $(INCDIR)/:g' \ -e '1,$s: ../os/unix/: $(OSDIR)/:g' Makefile.new \
        > Makefile.tmpl \
    && rm Makefile.new
util.c:85: test_char.h: No such file or directory
>How-To-Repeat:
util_uri.c:409: uri_delims.h: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [depend] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/apache_1.3.1/src/main'

State-Changed-Why:
make depend isn't really something that is designed for
user use.

In this case, it fails because you first have to build the
source tree before running make depend.
