>Environment:
Slackware Linux 2.2.14, compiled Apache with egcs-2.91.66
>Description:
If I put a line like:
	AddHandler cgi-script .foobar

somewhere that applies to the document root, and then put a file called
'dave.foobar' in the document root, then making a request to any of:
	http://my.server/dave/
	http://my.server/dave
	http://my.server/dave/foo/bar
invokes the handler 'cgi-script'. It shouldn't. I know it does because
it comes back with an error:
	Options ExecCGI is off in this directory: /home/jbodman/local/apache/htdocs/dave.foobar

If I create a directory 'dave' in the document root, then I'll get a
directory index of it when trying the same URL above (which is what I'd expect).

It seems like the matching of extensions is being done in a fuzzy way rather
than an exact one.
