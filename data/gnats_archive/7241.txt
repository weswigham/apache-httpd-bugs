>Environment:
I am running AIX version 4.3.2
>Description:
I downloaded the 1.3.17 binary for AIX and it installs fine.  However, when I run 'apachectl start' I get all kinds of errors about symbols not being found in httpd such as dlsym, dlerror, dlope, and dlclose.  I did not have these problems with version 1.3.12.  Is there something wrong with this compile?  Shouldn't it work with just the default install like 1.3.12 did?
>How-To-Repeat:
Load AIX 4.3.2 and install the 1.3.17 binary

State-Changed-Why:
That binary distribution for AIX has been removed (for reasons unknown).
Please try the latest (1.3.22).  If it fails to work properly,
open another problem.
