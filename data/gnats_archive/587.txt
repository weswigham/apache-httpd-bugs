SunOS 4.1.3, built with gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
I have a single server running NCSA HTTPd, and I'm trying to move it
over to Apache.  I've been testing a variety of links, and found behavior
that's incompatible between the two servers.  My apologies if this is a
known problem--I did try to find it in the FAQ and bug database first.

We have a user who has made a symbolic link "foo.cgi" to a real file
named "foo.pl".  We have not done anything special to recognize ".pl" files
as special.  The Perl file is using CGI utilities to generate real CGI.  (I.e.,
it's not a poorly written script that knows nothing of CGI/HTML.)  The .pl
file is executable in the filesystem.

With the NCSA server, going to the "foo.cgi" URL runs the perl script and
brings up the resulting form.  This is the desired behavior.

With the Apache server, it brings up the Perl source code.  This is not
the desired behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
First of all, does the HTTP standard define what's supposed to happen?
Perhaps the Apache behavior is more correct than the NCSA behavior.

If no contradictory standard exists, I prefer the NCSA behavior.

I glanced at the source code, but I couldn't figure out where the
decision is made

State-Changed-Why:
Have you configured Apache to treat files with the .cgi 
extension as CGI programs? If not, instructions on how to 
set this up are in the Apache FAQ at: 
  http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#CGIoutsideScriptAliasYou might also need to setup .pl extension similarly, to 
prevent people requesting the .pl file and seeing the source, 
or move the .pl file out of the document root. 
 
If this is not your problem, can you forward your configuration 
files and more details about the location of the .cgi link?
