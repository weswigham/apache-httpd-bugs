State-Changed-Why:
As very clearly described before you can submit a bug
report, this is for BUG REPORTS, not random questions.
We do not have the resources to support every question that
the 600000 users of Apache have.

You could try asking somewhere like the comp.infosystems.www.unix
newsgroup.  Looking at some of the related projects, such
as mod_php, linked to from http://www.apache.org/ would also
be a start.
