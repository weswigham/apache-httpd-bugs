>Description:
Configure script fails to include -lcrypt in the EXTRA_LIBS section for
RedHat 5.0 systems, producing:

mod_auth.o: In function `authenticate_basic_user':
mod_auth.o(.text+0x2d0): undefined reference to `crypt'
make: *** [httpd] Error 1

This is not hard to add yourself, but a very large number of RedHat
(5.0, not 4.x) users will probably be bitten by this.
>How-To-Repeat:
Stock RedHat 5.0 system, run ./Configure

State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately this will not be fixed in apache 1.2.  -lcrypt is
only needed for folks using glibc, and it will break the folks
still using libc5.  So it can't just be a default.  It is fixed in 1.3.
