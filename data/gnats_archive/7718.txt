State-Changed-Why:

This is not a bug report, but rather a configuration
question which should be asked in a user support
forum(for example 
news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows)

However, the solution is to remove the "Indexes"
keywork from the "Options" line in the appropriate
place in your config file.

Thanks for using Apache!
