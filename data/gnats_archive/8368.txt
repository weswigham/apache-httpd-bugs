>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional Service Pack 2 running Apache from MSI installer.
>Description:
Telling Apache to do a test of the httpd.conf file gave up no error, but Apache told me it could not [re]start.

Here were the lines causing the problem:
Errorlog e:/serve/Apache/DailyLaff/error.txt
CustomLog e:/serve/Apache/DailyLaff/access.txt common

Unfortunately these directories did not exist.  (The correct directory was e:/serve/Apache/logs/DailyLaff/)

These were contained in a virtualhost box.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put a directory that does not exist into a logging command, and try to restart apache.  It will not restart, but will report no error.
>Fix:
Change the -t switch to pick up directories in virtualhost logging commands that do not exist.
