HP-UX sdlhpp41 B.11.00 A 9000/780 
>Description:
I attempted to build on HP and when I ran ./configure it gave up when the 
unix/mm/configure file was checking for valid system include files

The test boiled down to generating this file:-
#line 1144 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <$ac_hdr>

and seeing if $CPP would run on it without generating any errors.

On my machine $CPP turned into gcc -E but the (HP supplied) stdlib.h generated
this warning:-

[69]  gcc -E  conftest.c >/dev/null
In file included from /usr/include/sys/resource.h:26,
                 from /tool_shed/gccnew/lib/gcc-lib/hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20/2.7.2.1/include/sys/wait.h:83,
                 from /tool_shed/gccnew/lib/gcc-lib/hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20/2.7.2.1/include/stdlib.h:231,
                 from configure:1145:
/tool_shed/gccnew/lib/gcc-lib/hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20/2.7.2.1/include/sys/time.h:492: warning: `FD_ISSET' redefined
/usr/include/sys/_fd_macros.h:72: warning: this is the location of the previous definition




>How-To-Repeat:
Try autoconfiguring on HP-UX 11
>Fix:
I cured it by changing the $CPPFLAGS to -E -w  to suppress the warnings

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Thu Aug 30 00:32:05 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
MM has been removed from Apache 2.0.  However this looks
like a system configuration problem.  You have two
different versions of standard header files, and they are
conflicting.

Thank you for using Apache.
