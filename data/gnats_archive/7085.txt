State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Wed Jan 17 17:32:47 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Modules written for Apache 1.3 will not work in
Apache 2.0 without some modification.  You should
probably wait until PHP starts to support Apache
2.0.

In addition, problems with PHP should be submitted
to the PHP bug database.

Thanks for using Apache.
