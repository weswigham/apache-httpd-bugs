>Description:
Given a CGI that performs an action base on the QUERY_STRING environment variable, and an HTML page that contains <!--#exec cgi="THAT_CGI" -->, and we load the HTML page as "test.shtml?a=b", we're finding that QUERY_STRING is undefined in the CGI, but on a 1.3.17 server it's set to "a=b" as we'd expect (and as it's worked for us through every version of Apache over the years until 1.3.20).

The CGI is definitely running, and if we invoke it directly the QUERY_STRING value is correct, but when it's <!--#exec ...>'d from within a parsed file it isn't being set.  This is breaking a lot of CGIs here and preventing us from upgrading several servers.

Any ideas?  I posted this in the newsgroup and tried to find a reference to it in the bug database, but neither turned up anything.

Thanks,

Mark

Comment-Added:

I can see one potential issue - are, or were you attempting
to use suexec for serving your CGIs (or any other fastcgi,
cgid, or other alternate CGI gateway)???
