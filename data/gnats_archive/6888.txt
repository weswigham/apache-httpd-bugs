I needed to be able to 'deny from' unresolved IP address so I quickly added a few 
lines of code in mod_access to support 'deny from unresolved'

I wonder if anyone (a real programmer I mean) would like to review to correctness
of the code and add it to the official apache mod_access.

best regards to the team

State-Changed-Why:

If the patch is small, feel free to append it to
this problem report by emailing it according to
the instructions above. (Please use plain text.)

However, I'm not sure that it will be incorporated
in Apache for two reasons:
1. The same thing can be accomplished with mod_rewrite.
(Although the syntax would obviously be more complicated.)
2. It seems like a relatively obscure requirement.
It obviously provides no real security.  However,
I can see where some people would find it useful.

In any case, thanks for the contribution.

 Please find it below.

 I'd like to explain further why it can be useful. We are working out 
 copyright problems and need to be able to exclude some countries from 
 non-authenticated (understand username + password) access. We have used
 'deny from country' in addition to a list of prefixed that we obtained 
 from a complex analysis of BGP announcements.
 
 We found out that it may be easier and more effective to require all 
 un-identified IP addresses to use a username and password. Therefore we 
 use a 'deny from unresolved' in conjunction with a 'satisfy any' and 
 a mysql password database. Denied users are asked for a password that 
 they should ask for. That comes in addition of prefix list we still 
 obtain from BGP analysis.
 
 The patch only adds 19 lines to the mod_access source. If it is correct 
 (I'm not a programmer) it is worth adding. I guess that with the ruling 
 of Yahoo and Nazi containt, people are going to have increasing problems
 identifying users. This patch might help.

I'll mark this as suspended for consideration in a
