Linux Slackware 7.0/kernel 2.2.17, with egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux
>Description:
mod_rewrite of 1.3.14 doesn't expand %{VARIABLE} variables in a ${MapName:LookupKey} context. 
e.g., the following lines in httpd.conf

RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower
RewriteRule ^(.+) ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}}$1

works well in 1.3.12¡£I got %{HTTP_HOST} expanded first, then ${lowercase:} convert it to lowercase. But 1.3.14 takes %{HTTP_HOST} as normal text, skipping  expanding it and I got a %{http_host} at last.

Here's rewrite.log I got:
>How-To-Repeat:
try to put these lines in httpd.conf:

RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower
RewriteRule ^(.+) ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}}$1

and you can only get 404 error¡£

I'm waiting for good news from ya guys :)
