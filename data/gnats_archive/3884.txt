>Description:
When a servlet are called through POST method it does not
receive parameters passed as a query string.

It works for Java Web Server and JRun.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create html page like this:
<form method=POST action="/servlets/SnoopServlet?var1=val1>
 <input type=hidden name=var2 value=val2>
 <input type=submit>
</form>

The servlet can get only val2 parameter though query string contains
var1=val1
>Fix:
Sorry, i don't know.
