FreeBsd4.3, apache 2.0.18 released version IE5 or Ie4
>Description:
I made a webpage that has one context in Chinese Chracter(GB2312). But the Webpage shows some odds when trying to show Chinese Chracter.
After manually customing language option,Chinese simplification(GB2312),The odds became normal.
I believe some bugs exist in you http or some other application or some models.
Hope u to correct or give me a satifying answer.
Wish A more robust version to come up. I like Apache and your apache workgroup's perfomance.

State-Changed-Why:
You need to configure your webserver to return the proper character set.  Currently, it is claiming the document is ISO-8859-1, which does not allow chinese characters.
