>Description:
Recently upgraded from apache 1.3.9 to 1.3.12 to try to fix this problem; no change.  
The LogFormat configuration is the default from the httpd.conf that comes with the apache 1.3.12 distribution.

The machine has 2 ethernet interfaces and several IPs; the output from ifconfig -a follows:
ef0: flags=415c43<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,FILTMULTI,MULTICAST,CKSUM,DRVRLOCK,LINK0,IPALIAS>
        inet 130.126.225.41 netmask 0xfffff800 broadcast 130.126.231.255
ef1: flags=415c43<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,FILTMULTI,MULTICAST,CKSUM,DRVRLOCK,LINK0,IPALIAS>
        inet 130.126.228.80 netmask 0xfffff800 broadcast 130.126.231.255
        inet 130.126.225.55 netmask 0xfffff800 broadcast 130.126.231.255
lo0: flags=1849<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST,CKSUM>
        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 
>How-To-Repeat:
If you hit http://www.scs.uiuc.edu, I'll get a 255.255.255.255 entry in access_log...
