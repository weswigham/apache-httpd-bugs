OS = BSD/OS 2.1
Compiler = gcc version 2.7.2
running SUExec
>Description:
The following C code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void
main()
{
    dup2(fileno(stdout), fileno(stderr));

    printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n"
           "<html>\n"
           "  <head></head>\n"
           "  <body>\n");

    fflush(stdout);

    printf("    <p>Hello worlk\n"
           "  </body>\n"
           "</html>\n");

    fflush(stdout);

    exit(0);
}

works fine if called from a standard script-aliased cgi-bin dir or from the
command line.  It failes with a "Premature end of script headers" message in
the error log if called from a dir that is not ScriptAliased but does have
ExecCGI turned on.  The suExec log shows

[14:53:00 07-10-97]: uid: (karres/karres) gid: (karres/karres) index.cgi
[14:53:00 07-10-97]: command not in docroot (/u2/karres/.www/trash/index.cgi)

which I suppose is reasonable considering that the script is not in the cgi-bin
and isn't supposed to be -- perhaps this is the problem?

The ScriptLog shows

%% [Tue Oct  7 14:53:00 1997] GET /~karres/trash/index.cgi HTTP/1.0
%% 500 /u2/karres/.www/trash/index.cgi
%request
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/3.0Gold (X11; I; BSD/OS 3.0 i386)
Pragma: no-cache
Host: www2.southwind.net
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*
%response

The Options that *should* be in effect at this point are

	Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI

This is happening with a couple of other scripts as well but this is the
simplest example that demonstrates the prolem.

State-Changed-When: Tue Oct  7 13:55:41 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Please read the suexec docs.  Everything needs to either
be under the docroot defined in suexec.h or in a
~userdir request.  It appears you have some
DocumentRoot pointing to /u2/karres/.www, which is outside
the docroot you set for suexec so it will not work.

suexec does not currently have the functionality to
allow for multiple docroots.
