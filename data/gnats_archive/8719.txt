>Release:        1.3.20
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Should work for all, built and first-run tested on a andrake Linux 8.1 distribution under a Linux 2.4.13 kernel using GCC 2.96
>Description:
I like domain, www.domain, ww.domain, wwww.domain etc to all point to the same files and have collected enough domains on one particular server to render configuring for each individual domain a tedious task. I could use symlinks under mod_vhost_alias but again there would be a lot of them and it's more maintenance. I can't use mod_rewrite (unless I've read the docs wrong) because it takes effect after a virtual server path is chosen.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a dynamic vhost webserver with lots of names pointing to the same pages.
>Fix:
I've added an option to mod_vhost_alias which allows a list of leading text strings to be specified, at most one of which is removed before choosing a virtual server path. Modified source plus a context diff is available at http://www.cyberknights.com.au/apache/ for a limited time only. (-:

I don't know what the performance is like and haven't yet tested it extensively. If it gets used and documented, be sure to mention that the longest match should be specified first, and that while a dot at the end of the match string is optional, it is also safer.
