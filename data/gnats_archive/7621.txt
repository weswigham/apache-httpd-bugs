>Description:
Hi!

I have the following situation: i have created several html-pages, that
have forms included, which will be processed by perl script. The script
takes about 10 sec to finish.

In the case, a user stops the cgi-script, the perl-process on the webserver
is still running and does'nt die. So i have to kill the process manually
by using the task manager.

Is there a solution for the problem?
>How-To-Repeat:
Start a script that will run some seconds and stop it by clicking the
stop-button on the browser before the script has finished.
>Fix:
What about apache directives?
