all
>Description:
There are only a few items in the top part of httpd.h.  I've found it
useful to put my Web related stuff under /WWW/, and the servers themselves
by version under /WWW/Servers/.  (Ie, the top of the docs tree is 
/WWW/htdocs and 1.2b8 lives under /WWW/htdocs/apache_1.2b8 with all the
attendant subdirectories like conf/ and logs/.)  It would be nice to be 
able to configure this in one place (Configuration) rather than have to
edit both Configuration and httpd.h.
