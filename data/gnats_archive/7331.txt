>Description:
I'm not 100% sure if this is a bug, but I can't reproduce it on the same system running 1.3.14. Running under solaris, with use of SSI includes, after about 12-18 hours of serving appx. 100,000 hits an hour, the CPU utilization increases dramatically on the box up around 50-60%. Pages take 20-30 secs to come back. If I manually telnet to port 80, and do a GET / HTTP/1.0, it will retrieve part of the page, hang on an SSI tag, wait 5 secs, and continue on, like there is some kind of extensive processing occurring to generate the SSI tag.  I don't notice anything unusual about the system other than this. If I stop and restart apache, it immediately starts to eat up as much CPU power, my only option is to reboot.
>How-To-Repeat:
not to my knowledge, I can't detect anything specific that seems to set this off

no
