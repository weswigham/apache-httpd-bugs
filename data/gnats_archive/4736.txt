sco 5.04 on a poweredge 4300 /dell
>Description:
already described in #1068, and until now aplying the fixe 
(add a fclose(stdout) at the start of the child.) worked perfectly...

unfortunately, about the time i tried to use mod_so, this problem reappared
even with closing stdout in the child...
>How-To-Repeat:
very easy:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
        {
        int             pid;                    /*child ID*/
        pid=fork();
        if(pid!=0)      /*PARENT*/
                {
                printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");
                printf("<html><head></head><body>\n");
                printf("<h1>PARENTAL ZOMBIES 3</h1>\n");
                printf("</body></html>\n");
                exit(0);
                }
        else
                {               /*CHILD*/
                fclose(stdout);        // worked well until now
                sleep(20);
                exit(0);
                }
        return(0);
        }
>Fix:
i'm definitely not a uniox expert, but, by analogy, apache might be keeping another strem open while in "dynamic" mode... Which one or where... i don't know.
