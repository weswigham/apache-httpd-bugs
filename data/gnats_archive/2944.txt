>Description:
 With MultiViews enabled you can't easily get document name without language
or charset suffix in static documents. It is needed to make alternative
language links in every page.
 Here is the patch, I'm not sure this is the best way, maybe the possibillity
to remove subject from string would be more reliable.

In what way will it "not work" for index.html?  What
would you expect, and what do you get instead?  Please
provide a detailed example..
