win 98 release 2
>Description:
I have a Toshiba Laptop (Satellite 2595XDVD) wiht an Intel Celeron 400 processor, running
Win 98 release 2. My intent was to install Apache as a standalone in order to 
test PHP server-side scripts.

The installation process of Apache Server 1.3.12 went fast, with no errors. Starting
the server from the start menu produced a dos window that flashed for a second and then closed.
http://127.0.0.1 in Netscape 4.07 produced a message "Unable to locate host".

The error log had no documents in it, and the install log showed no problems.

I made no changes to the config files.

State-Changed-Why:

You need to try starting Apache from the command line when
the command window blinks a disappears.

Edit your httpd.conf file and make sure you set up the
ServerRoot entry with your machine's IP name or ID, i.e.
localhost  -or-  127.0.0.1
