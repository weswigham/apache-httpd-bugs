In my configuration, FancyIndexing is globaly activated by adding

	FancyIndexing on

in srm.conf, and works with all directories that need indexing.
For a special directory, I need to hide some crunched file, using 

	IndexIgnore *.Z

Unfortunatly, this directive disable FancyIndexing for this particular directory.
The workaround is to add the well known 

IndexOptions FancyIndexing

in this <directory> section.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add an IndexIgnore in a directory section.

State-Changed-Why:

This is due to a problem with how mod_autoindex merges its
per-directory configuration records.  I'm revamping it
right now, and should have a patch for you to try soon.

using Apache!
