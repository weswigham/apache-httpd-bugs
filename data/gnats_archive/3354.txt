>Description:
I set up a ProxyPass directive, eg:

ProxyPass /foo/  http://www.foo.com/

I then request the URL /foo/some/url/containing/%2F/wont/work.  Apache
gives a 404, saying the URL could not be found on this server instead
of passing the request through to the proxy.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up any ProxyPass, request a URL that should be proxied but contains
an HTTP escape sequence, eg %2F.

 Are you sure it happens with any %-escaped character?
 %2F is special to Apache and it does not deal with requests that have it
 in at all, nothing particular to the proxy.
