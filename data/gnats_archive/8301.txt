>Description:
I downloaded apache 1.3.20 Then did the following -
----------------------------------------------------
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
make
make install
/usrlocal/apache/bin/apachectl start

At this juncture I got the following error -
--------------------------------------------
/usr/local/apache/bin/httpd: lib/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.2' not found ( required by /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd)
/usr/local/apache/bin apachectl start: httpd could not be started.
