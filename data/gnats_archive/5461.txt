Linux 2.3.13 (Apache was pre-compiled, however.)
>Description:
After upgrading apache and making the necessary changes to httpd.conf, 
none of the previously-working CGI's on the system
would work unless they were located in /home/httpd/cgi-bin. I can copy a 
working cgi from /home/httpd/cgi-bin to a user's cgi-bin directory, and it
returns the following error (on the browser):

--------------------------------
(500 Internal Server Error)
Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, www@csisnet5.uvsc.edu and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may
have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.
------------------------------------
In the error log, I see the following line:
[Sat Dec 11 20:49:24 1999] [error] [client xx.xx.xx.xx] Premature end of script headers: /home/user/public_html/cgi-bin/xx.cgi

Here is a copy of the relevant parts of my httpd.conf:
---------------------------
LoadModule cgi_module         modules/mod_cgi.so
AddModule mod_cgi.c

User www
Group www

<Directory /home/httpd/cgi-bin>
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory /home/*/public_html/cgi-bin>
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .sh .pl
--------------------------
>How-To-Repeat:
Every working cgi I copy from /home/httpd/cgi-bin to 
/home/user/public_html/cgi-bin will not work. All permissions are set exactly
as they were with Apache 1.3.6, which worked just fine. I can send you the
URL for an example, but this is the case for every cgi on the system.
>Fix:
Go back to 1.3.6 for now, I guess. :/

State-Changed-Why:
You are probably using Red Hat's precompiled distribution.
Unfortunately, they make the very very foolish move of
enabling suexec by default.  If you look at the error log
from the server starting, it will probably give some message
about suexec being enabled.  You can disasble this by
getting rid of the suexec binary, wherever they hid it.

or you can look at the suexec log, wherever they decided to
put that, and see exactly why it is complaining.  Probably
due to the ownership or permissions.
