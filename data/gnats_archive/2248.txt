>Description:
I noted in the bug database the comment that apache supplies its own strdup, but this is incorrect for logresolve.c.  The context-diff patch supplied below fixes this for NeXT, and I expect for other systems missing strdup as well.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the report. 
But this problem was already fixed for 1.3b7 recently.
The logresolve.c from 1.3b7 should compile fine when its
available.
