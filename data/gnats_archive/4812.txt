State-Changed-Why:

The basic rule is that a module is only a candidate for
inclusion in the base package if someone known and
participating on the Apache developer mailing list
volunteers to maintain it.  There are exceptions to
this, of course, but we don't want to include items
that none of the participants are willing to support.
There's also the issue of ownership and licence.  If
Zeev wants to participate and support it, and the
licence isn't incompatible, there a pretty good chance
this could be done.
