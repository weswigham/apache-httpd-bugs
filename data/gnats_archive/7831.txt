Multiple. Tested on:

MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.2.1.3m
Apache 1.3.6

Linux hostname 2.2.19 #2 Fri Apr 20 00:12:07 EDT 2001 i586 unknown
gcc --version

Apache 1.3.19
>Description:
I almost filed this as a bug report for mod_access. Re-reading the httpd.conf syntax docs showed that comments are not allowed on the same line as a directive. Thus, this is now a reports against the conf file parser. Very basic config:

<VirtualHost 192.168.1.2>
  ServerName www.foo.dom
  DocumentRoot /path/to/root
  <Location />
    <Limit GET HEAD POST OPTIONS>
      order deny,allow
      deny from all
      allow from 192.168.1.0/24  # local net
    </Limit>
  </Location>
</VirtualHost>

The above passes 'httpd -t'. However, it lets any client access http://www.foo.dom/. The fun part about this is that if you change:

      allow from 192.168.1.0/24  # local net

to:

      allow from 192.168.1.0/24  # local new

or even to:

      allow from 192.168.1.0/24  # local network

...the access list behaves like it's supposed to. Not sure why the word 'net' has that effect, but there you are. Verified with two different clients on 3 different hosts against two different servers (the two shown in "environment"). Obviously an syntactically invalid configuration can/will produce unpredictable behavior; nonetheless, the error should be caught by the parser.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure a <Location> block as above.
>Fix:
Assuming that the docs are current and that comments still aren't allowed on the same line as a directive (a tad annoying, but certainly live-withable), the code which parses the config file (obviously) needs to be tighted up to catch such a configuration. Hey, the field was here. There was a moral imperative to enter something here. :)

State-Changed-Why:

Unfortunately, the -t syntax checker is a very simple
creature.  It really can only test for correct directive
names and number of arguments.  In order to actually
know whether each directive was used correctly, it
would need to do much more work.

Thanks for using Apache!
