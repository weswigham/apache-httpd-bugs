>Description:
When I try to install Apache as a service, the "My Computer" dialog box pops up.  Is this trying to tell me something?  I have the service running in the dos mode, but I am not having luck getting it to run in windows.  Is this a bug or can someone help me out here?  I have also rebooted.
>How-To-Repeat:
The only way I can repeat it is to click on install as a service, and then it brings up the "My Computer" dialog box.
