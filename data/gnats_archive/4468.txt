>Originator:     rommel@ars.de
>Release:        1.3.6
>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT, binary distribution from www.apache.org
>Description:
The proxy module does not proxy secure pages. The client waits very long and
finaly shows a "cannot connect to server" message.

The same configuration files used with the OS/2 version of Apache 1.3.4
(the latest I had for testing) work correctly and secure pages are proxied
correctly.

Apache 1.3.4 on Win32 shows the same bug as 1.3.6, so it is not a new bug
introduced with 1.3.6 but a NT platform specific one.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try any secure page such as https://www.ars.de (this server uses a private
CA and not a certificate issued by Verisign etc. but this makes no difference).
>Fix:
Perhaps it is a compiler bug on Win32, because the same code works fine
on OS/2 where a different compiler is used to build the executables.

 I have STILL not heard from anyone working on this bug. Will it
 ever be fixed?
