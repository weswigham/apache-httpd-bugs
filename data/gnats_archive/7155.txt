Apache server, despite the fix that IBM provides at:
ftp://techsupport.services.ibm.com/aix/fixes/v4/other/vac.C.4.4.0.3.bff
ftp://techsupport.services.ibm.com/aix/fixes/v4/other/vac.C.readme.ibm.4.4.0.1.bff

Do you have further informations about this fix ?
Do any people reach to start Apache on AIX with the C for AIX Compiler ?

Thanks a lot for all.
