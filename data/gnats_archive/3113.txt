>Environment:
windows NT, binary release 1.3.2, 
>Description:
In my perl script, I execute commands through "system mycommd", the
command is in the PATH environment, but the script can not find it. I must copy
the command to the current working directory of the script.
>How-To-Repeat:
if you have bash commands available on windows NT, include the bash/bin directory in your
system path, and verify that one of the command (e.g., ls) can be invoked from command line. 
Then create a perl script invoking the command by "system ls".

 I would like to cancel this bug.
 I found that I can use mod_env SetEnv to set the environment.
 
 Thanks,
