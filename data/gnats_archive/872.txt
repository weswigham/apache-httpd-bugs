 Please provide the output of src/helpers/GuessOS.  You can probably
 correct this error by following the instructions in PR#467:
 <http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi/full/467>.  Don't worry that your
 symptoms don't totally match 467, it sounds like your OS has far worse
 problems that need to be worked around and serialization should do it.

 It looks like we need to -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT under hpux.

 Dear Mr. Gaudet,
 
 Thank you for your quick answer to my request. 
 
 Meanwhile I
 compilled Apache with -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
 (-DUSE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT did not work). After two days testing we
 installed  it for our users. It seems to work. However I would still need 
 a few days more to have a definitive adjugement.
 
 The output of src/helpers/GuessOS is:
 9000/735-hp-hpux.
 we know that our system is a little unsual since it is a combination of
 hpux and convex.
 
 Thank you again for your kindness. If the error still appears, I
 will contact you again.
 
 Ge Zhang
