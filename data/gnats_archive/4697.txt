>Description:
The SERVER_PROTOCOL environment variable is supposedly set to
"INCLUDED" if the resource was accessed through a subrequest
or a server-side include.  Unfortunately, this appears to
reliably be the case only if the document is a CGI script;
server-parsed SSI documents still get the value of the parent
request.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a CGI script and an SSI document, each of which simply
displays the value of the SERVER_PROTOCOL environment variable.
Then access them from an SSI document with 'include virtual="file"'.
>Fix:
r->protocol is set to "INCLUDED" in routine ap_set_sub_req_protocol()
in http_protocol.c.  I suspect that this is either not being invoked
in all the correct codepaths, or else that mod_include.c should be
setting the field directly.
