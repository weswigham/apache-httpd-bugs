>Environment:
Solaris 2.5, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
mod_dir does not write anything to the error_log when a
403 response is returned due to the directory not being readable
or the configuration not allowing Indexes.

    if(!(d=opendir(name))) return FORBIDDEN;

and

    if (allow_opts & OPT_INDEXES)
        return index_directory (r, d);
    else
        return FORBIDDEN;

are the culprits.
>How-To-Repeat:
chmod a web directory to non-readable by the web server,
or set Options None in a .htaccess file, make a request
on that directory's URL, and then look in the error_log.
>Fix:
Ummm, call log_reason with an error message before returning
