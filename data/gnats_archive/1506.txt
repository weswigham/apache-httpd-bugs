>Description:
Using the cgi-bin scripts below, the following differences 
appear in the output:

Using /cgi-bin/env.sh/foo/bar/UPPER you get
PATH_INFO=/foo/bar/UPPER
SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/env.sh

Using /cgi-bin/env.bat/foo/bar/UPPER you get
PATH_INFO=/foo/bar/upper
SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/env.bat/foo/bar/UPPER

Problems with 1.3b3 on NT:
1. PATH_INFO is lower-case
2. SCRIPT_NAME is too long (should be /cgi-bin/env.bat)

Is that intentional? It broke my cgi-bin, and I think that's
true for other scripts as well.

Thanks for your efforts.

Make environment as similar to Unix as possible
