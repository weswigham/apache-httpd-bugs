>Description:
When sending data with length over 4830 bytes through HTTP POST method propably serverside loses information. Client sends all data (over 4830) but our cgi-script receives only 4830 bytes.
As far as we know there shouldn't be any length limitations when using POST.

State-Changed-Why:

No, you should not see this behavior.  But is the read mode
currently 'text' as opposed to 'raw' mode?  If your cgi is
translating (via the perl or c libraries) any CR-LF pair
into a LF, it will affect the content length.

Is this your discrepancy?  Otherwise, please include more
details in your reply.
