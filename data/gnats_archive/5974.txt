 See:
 
 	http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#limitrequestline
 
 However, unless you have manually decresed this limit, then your code is
 doing something pretty silly to generate URIs >8000 chars.  Make sure that
 it is not using GET when it should be using POST.  Many clients, proxies,
 and servers don't support insanely long URIs.
