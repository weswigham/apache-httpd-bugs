>Description:
Usually, the error_log file will report when a client requests a non-existant file.  But nothing is appended to the error_log when a .PHP document comes up missing.
The configured ErrorDocument for 404 does show up though.
I'm assuming that this would not be a problem if I had not installed the PHP module.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install PHP precompiler from www.php.net and then look for a non-existant .PHP file on your server.
>Fix:
My hypothesis (undereducated guess) is that the PHP module still attempts to parse and somehow does not pass control back to apache to record the error.

State-Changed-Why:
If, as you suspect, this is a php issue we can't do anything
about it...

You need to raise this with the php people, since it doesn't
work only when using php...
