>Description:
The server gets hung on a CLOSE_WAIT state and the entire server must be rebooted
to correct the problem.  Trying to start Apache gives httpd: could not bind to port 80.

netstat -a shows:

home.lookonline.com.80 ww-tr03.proxy.aol.com.42518 61320      0  8335      0 CLOSE_WAIT

>How-To-Repeat:
problem recurs when a kill -HUP `cat httpd.pid` is issued.
>Fix:
no

 Try recompiling apache with EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DNO_SLACK and tell us if that
 helps any. 
 
 You should also make sure you've got the latest tcp/ip patches on the
 system... solaris 2.x x<6 tcp/ip is uh, lacking something depending on
 what patches you have.
