>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Server SP3 
Installed the precompiled Apache 1.3.2 Win32 binary
>Description:
I am in the process of migrating a running Apache 1.24 Intranetserver on OS/2 to the current 1.3.2 Apache for Win32.
On OS/2 I had the possibility to enter the UserDir in the srm.conf in the form of "UserDir //Servername/*/HTML" thus providing the users to generate a directory named "html" in their homeshare on a different server than the webserver and access it via the webserver width the URL "http://webserver/~username".
When I tried this on the Apache 1.3.2 Win32, Apache generated a "Not found" error (see next field).
>How-To-Repeat:
Entered URL: http://194.37.228.107/~amsmleyr/
--- Server-errormessage start ---
Not Found

File does not exist: //amsbg003/amsmleyr\/html/
--- Server-errormessage end ---
>Fix:
IMHO, there is an error in the code witch adds an extra "\" to the passed username.
The Filename should have been //amsbg003/amsmleyr/html/

State-Changed-By: kparz@raleigh.ibm.com
State-Changed-When: Wed Nov 18 09:54:55 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Yep, this was a problem in the os_canonical_filename
routine in 1.3.2.  The routine would add the incorrect
slash.  This routine has been fixed in CVS, and
should be available in the next release of apache for
Windows.

Thanks for using Apache!
