>Description:
I have repeatedly looked at my "access.conf" file to be sure it is correctly configured as follows:
<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status

order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from .mydomain
</Location>

I get an error when I try to access the URL http://hostname/server-status
Not Found
The requested URL /server-status/ was not found on this server
The requested URL /server-status was not found on this server

The server-status used to work on my previous release before the upgrade to 1.3 but now it doesn't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do and upgrade to 1.3 from 1.2
>Fix:
I have looked through the bug database and found some possible info about it not being implemented into the daemon when it is initailly compiled.  Do I need to recompile (how exactly) or can I add a Loadmodule line to the "httpd.conf"
PR#2424 states that the module should be specified using "configure" but not apaci which is what I used.

 Did you add the proper flags, as per the apaci docs, to enable the status
 module when you compiled?
 
 If you run "httpd -l" is mod_status included there?
