>Description:
When apache is compiled, and installed it generates a file httpd.h, in the include directory.

This file includes a file called os.h, which cannot be found. Thus any use of httpd.h results in a symbol not found message.

I tried copying the file from os/unix/os.h(and os-inline.c) to the include path but was still seeing symbol not found errors while trying to compile the resin modules for apache.
While this symbol problem could be a resin/apache versions issue .. os.h should still be getting installed from someplace.

thanx
>How-To-Repeat:
compile and do a make install and see if you can find a os.h anywhere in the installed header libraries.
