>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 service pack 3
Visual C++ 5.0
>Description:
When Apache is configured as a proxy server on Windows NT it attempts to open
.htaccess files in the directories where the cache is stored.  Unfortunately
it wants to open the .htaccess file in a directory called:
               /apache/proxy:http:
where the colons are actually part of the directory name.  WNT does not like
colons in file names or directory names and an error is logged in the error_log
file.  The browser sees a 403, access forbidden by rule.
