>Environment:
Red Hat Linux Release 6.2 Kernal 2.2.14-5.0 on an i686
>Description:
Using a cgi script(PERL5.005_03 and TCL8.0) within a folder containing .htaccess (tried actual copy, soft link, and hard link) after three consequetive calls within the same directory, the environment variable REMOTE_USER is dropped by the browser and can no longer be accessed.  Tested this problem with I.E 5.0.2290 on a Win2000 and netscape-navigator-4.72-6 on a Linux Redhat6.0 machine.
>How-To-Repeat:
In perl- $thisuser = $ENV{"REMOTE_USER"};print "$thisuser";
In TCL- global env, set user $env(REMOTE_USER), puts "$user"
put these into three scripts in the same folder and on the third call setting the variable will fail.
