Hi,

First, thank you all for all this good job you made since the beginning of the Apache Project.

My little opinion on APACI : The main drawback is that we must work with command line options.
In this case, if i have to come back to this configuration later and compile it again,
i have to remind what this command line exactly was. :(
So it was simpler for me to use the previous configuration style and edit Configuration.tmpl and have all these options already set.

The best solution for this problem, IMHO, is to provide a little user-friendly menu-based configuration program.
It may be text-mode based. No really need for tcl/tk or such.
A good example for that is the linux kernel configuration program that let you select
options and save your configuration file. Even if it looks better under Xwindow because you can see
all the options on one screen instead of seeing only one option at a time.
Thank you for your time.

 That's why we added the `config.status' feature. Look at the top-level where
 `configure' stays. After running it a script named `config.status' is created
 which stores all variables and options and can be re-run later to restore the
 configuration. Alternatively you can at least use it as a container where you
 look manually for the options you used.

 What about creating a user friendly configuration program/script to do all
 this ? Is this something you plan ?
 
 Best regards,

 It's not on my todo list and because for Apache 2.0 the configuration stuff
 has to be rewritten again IMHO it's not worth the effort to now create an even
 more friendly script. So, I'm sure the Apache Group will not provide another
 build-frontend theirself for Apache 1.3.
