>Description:
http status codes are supposed to be three digit, yet i'm getting two digit, code 32. i was getting the same problem in build 2.0.25. 

from my access_log:
adolphus.spriggs.net: 67.218.75.193 [25/Jan/2002:08:36:02 -0800] "GET /~grif/ola-content.pdf HTTP/1.1" 32 1066735
adolphus.spriggs.net: 67.218.75.193 [25/Jan/2002:08:36:03 -0800] "GET /~grif/ola-content.pdf HTTP/1.1" 32 1066735
adolphus.spriggs.net: 67.218.75.193 [25/Jan/2002:08:36:04 -0800] "GET /~grif/ola-content.pdf HTTP/1.1" 32 1066735
adolphus.spriggs.net: 67.218.75.193 [25/Jan/2002:08:36:05 -0800] "GET /~grif/ola-content.pdf HTTP/1.1" 206 1069399

it looks like the user's browser was attempting partial reads. to show the problem isn't just pdf files and isn't any particular client, an earlier example:

State-Changed-Why:

This was fixed this week; filters error result (apr_status_t)
values were directly used as HTTP status codes.  This is now
resolved and you should see a legitimate HTTP error with the
forthcoming release of 2.0.34.
