>Description:
I would like to have two more % escapes added to mod_log_config.c.

%m - request method
%c - request protocol

this way, you can construct a custom "GET /uri HTTP/1.0" type entry.  we use
this extensively in house.

also - i have patched log_request_uri to have the query string in the logfile
if one was specified.  i'm not sure what the best way is to get that in the
program.  perhaps yet another % escape to do it?  let me know what you think.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
here's my patch for the first two escapes, against the 1.3.1 source:

*** mod_log_config.c.orig       Mon Aug  3 10:23:54 1998
--- mod_log_config.c    Mon Aug  3 10:34:39 1998

  {
      return ap_psprintf(r->pool, "%ld", (long) getpid());
  }

+ {

+ }
+ char *log_protocol (request_rec *r, char *a)
+ {
+   return r->protocol;
+ }

      {

 There is no reason this can't go in 1.3.x...
