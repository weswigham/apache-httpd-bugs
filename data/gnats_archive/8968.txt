>Description:
While processing server side includes, the HTML is truncated after the first SSI is brought in.  Error.log only shows "premature EOF in parsed file g:/inetpub/wwwroot/index.shtml".  I am attempting to migrate from IIS 5 to Apache.  I already changed all my 'file="absolute path"' to 'virtual="absolute path"'.  The first SSI was brought in, but the processing seems to stop there.  No text at all appears after the SSI.  I saw on one of the other threads that there might be a buffering problem, but I'm not trying to include anything large.
>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot include a URL because this is behind a company firewall.

State-Changed-Why:

That error most often occurs when you have not properly
closed an SSI tag or something similar.  We can't help in
debugging SSI here, but if you'd like to join
http://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html
and post more details there, somebody may be able
to help.

Thanks for using Apache!
