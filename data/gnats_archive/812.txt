>Description:
In line 172 of proxy_http.c, proxy_http_handler() blindly assumes "http://"
URL which is not always the case if ProxyRemote is defined.
For example, when "ftp://user:passwd@host:port/path" is being forwarded,
desthost, destport and destportstr variables are not properly set.
As a result, wrong hostname is checked against NoCache and
ProxyBlock directives and wrong "Host:" header is sent.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set "ProxyRemote * other.proxy.server", and "ProxyBlock some.domain".
will pass "GET ftp://some.domain".
>Fix:
I temporarily replaced url+=7; with a fragment of code to handle
both http: and ftp: for my purpose, but shoudn't it be done
somewhere outside of proxy_http_handler()%3

State-Changed-Why:

Yes, you are right... this is indeed a bug.
It's some code from the past where mod_proxy was only
able to deal with http:// requests.
