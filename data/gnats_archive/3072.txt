>Description:
This is a piece of my access.conf

	# Acces aux statistiques du on-line
	<Directory /stpdata/online/stat/ticket>
	AuthDBMUserFile conf/usr
	AuthDBMGroupFile conf/usr
	AuthName "Stats de l'activite WEB"
	AuthType Basic
	require group stat_web
	Options +Indexes +Includes
	IndexIgnore *.Z	URLS totaux
	IndexOptions FancyIndexing
	AddDescription	"Coupe du monde 1998"	cdm98
	AddDescription	"Anciennes statistiques"	res
	AddDescription	"Statistiques hebdomadaires"	sem_*
	</Directory>

and in the /stpdata/online/stat/ticket directory, i have 3 sub-directories named sem_3598, sem_3698 and sem_3798.
But no description is added to this directory.

I think this is a bug because using *_*, or *98 works well.

State-Changed-Why:

The reason the filenames with '*' at the front worked is because
it was matching the '*' with the directory path.  The one that
is not working is trying to match the strings 

"/stpdata/online/stat/ticket/sem_whatever"

with

"sem_*"

These obviously do not match.  I am working on a patch, but in
the meantime, either add the full path to the file or add a '*'
to the front of the filename.

This has been fixed and should appear in the next release
after 1.3.6.  Thanks for using Apache!
