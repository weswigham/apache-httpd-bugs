>Description:
I noticed that the magic file fails to recognize some nowadays popular and perfectly legal MIME-types. I have a patch.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try for example have the magic module recognize a video/quicktime file.
>Fix:
Yes, here is a patch for the "magic" file with some new magic (not everyone I could come up with, but some):
