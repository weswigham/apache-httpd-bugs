>Release:        1.3b6
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation SP 3
Binary relase or VC++ 5.0 compiled
>Description:
Apache Win32 release doesn't execute any cgi-sripts which have
.cmd extension. .cmd is a native command line skript file
for WinNT. Win95 and MS-DOS uses .bat extension. WinNT can
handle .bat files ok, so the quick fix is to rename any cmd
to bat.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to execute any cgi-skript with .cmd extension on NT server.
>Fix:
Add line:
!strcasecmp(dot, ".CMD") ||
to main/util_scipt.c (line 731 or something...)
