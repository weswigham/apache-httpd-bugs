 Brooklyn Knights midfielder Hemir Niebles to play in 2002 Umbro Select All-Star Classic
 
  
 
 Met Oval, New York - February 2, 2002 - 
 The Brooklyn Knights of the Premier Development 
 League are proud to announce midfielder Hemir Niebles 
 has been selected to participate in the seventh annual 
 Umbro Select All-Star Classic to be held Feb. 7-10 at 
 Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
 
 The four-day combine features nearly 60 of the top 
 collegiate and PDL prospects in the country who are 
 looking to land spots in Major League Soccer or the A-
 League. Niebles is one of just 16 players to play on an 
 all-PDL team at the 2002 Umbro Select All-Star Classic.
 
 Niebles, who turned 22 on New Year's Day, was one of 
 the top midfielders in the PDL last year and was a major 
 reason the Brooklyn Knights enjoyed its most successful 
 season in club history. The Knights, comprised 
 exclusively of players ages 23-and-under, finished the 
 2001 season with a 13-7-1 mark and advanced to the 
 PDL Eastern Conference semifinals.
 
 "He is one of the best right outside midfieders who has 
 gone undiscovered," said Brooklyn Knights head coach 
 Joe Barone. "He possesses incredible speed with the 
 ball and has an ability to get behind defenders. Hemir 
 has a great cross and an incredible shot, as well as a 
 very quick first step."
 
 
 The 5-foot-9 Niebles, who was born in Columbia but 
 has American citizenship, has a rich soccer background. 
 He trained at the prestigious Tahuichi Aguilera Academy 
 in Bolivia and played with the Destroyers of the Bolivian 
 first division in 1999 and 2000.
 
 In 20 games last season with the Knights, Niebles had 
 10 goals and 12 assists for 32 points. Some highlights 
 include scoring the game-winner in the Brooklyn 
 Knights' 2-0 win over the Vermont Voltage on May 20, 
 2001. He assisted on the game-winning tally in a 4-0 
 victory over the Cape Cod Crusaders on June 3. 
 
 Niebles insured the Knights earned a bonus point in a 4-
 0 win over the Chesapeake Dragons June 10 on a 
 brilliantly struck free kick into the upper right corner of 
 the net from 25-yards out. 
 
 He slotted home the Knights lone goal in a 1-1 draw 
 against the New York Freedoms June 14. Niebles also 
 had an assist in Brooklyn's season-ending 3-2 loss to 
 the host Cocoa Expos in the PDL Eastern Conference 
 semifinals.
 
 
 Niebles is the third player in Brooklyn Knights history to 
 be invited to the Umbro Select All-Star Classic, 
 following in the footsteps of John Wolyniac and Julian 
 Gomez, who were each signed by the NY/NJ 
 Metrostars. 
 
 Barone said Niebles reminds him a bit of U.S. National 
 team defender Carlos Llamosa, who he coached with 
 the Brooklyn Italians. Barone said like Niebles, Llamosa 
 had a lot of talent, but went relatively unnoticed. 
 Llamosa is also from the same area of Columbia as 
 Niebles and also lived in Maspeth, Queens.
 
 "A lot of the MLS and A-League clubs should be looking 
 at the Brooklyn Knights organization for undiscovered 
 talent because we have some of the best city kids that 
 no one gets to see," Barone said. "We're showcasing 
 them in the PDL."
