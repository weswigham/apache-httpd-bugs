Red Hat 5.0 Linux
>Description:
We just noticed that when we try to view our home page using Netscape, all we see is page HTML source.  When we view with Internet Explorer, it displays fine.  The Log file doesn't indicate anything special, so we are at a loss.

Note that when we copy the html pages to our local hard drive and view them with netscape, they appear to be fine.

State-Changed-Why:
This is not an apache bug.  This is a RedHat bug.  Go edit
your /etc/mime.types and add "htm" as a file extension for
html files.  There are only about a dozen other reports of
this in the bugdb already.
