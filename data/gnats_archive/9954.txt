>Description:
Recently installed apache webserver. Followed directions and configured the Vhosts as directed. re-started apache then got the following when trying to access the webpage. "403 Forbidden You don't have permission to access / on this server." the Document roots are "/home/userblah/public_html" Do I need to configure permissions? If so, how? Not sure if it matters but I do have "Options FollowSymLinks Indexes" as I have read in some of the FAQ's. Please forgive me for my ignorance if im missing something. Any answers?
