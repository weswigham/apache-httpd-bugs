>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
AIX 4.3.2 with accompanying IBM java version 1.1.6. gcc 2.95.2

uname -a: AIX aix2dev 3 4 00014030A300
>Description:
When httpd reaches the line in httpd.conf "LoadModule jserv_module /appl/www/libexec/mod_jserv.so", it loads the module into itself. The module initialization routines are called and get to a point where the module wants to call back into httpd. Specifically, right at the beginning of jserv_server_config_create() in mod_jserv.c is a call to ap_pcalloc(). This is where httpd dumps core (SIGSEGV). A stack trace points to strcmp.strcmp in glink.s. This is not a problem when using Apache 1.3.9!
>How-To-Repeat:
Build vanilla Apache 1.3.12 and Apache JServ 1.1 on AIX 4.3.2 using gcc.
>Fix:
Manually re-link libjserv.so.0.0.0 with the additional option of "-Wl,-bI:/appl/www/libexec/httpd.exp".
