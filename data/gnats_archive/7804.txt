>Description:
Hi.
If you try to protect your server by the following directives:

<Directory />
    Options None
    AllowOverride None
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</Directory>

<FilesMatch "*">
    Options None
    AllowOverride None
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

and then only allow access for the document root like

<Directory /var/www/>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  <FilesMatch "\.(html|png|gif|jpeg|jpg|php)$">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </FilesMatch>
</Directory>

where mod_dir is loaded and
DirectoryIndex i index.php

you _should_ be able to see http://server/

instead access is denied. BUT if you change FilesMatch above to:
<FilesMatch "^.{1,3}$|\.(html|png|gif|jpeg|jpg|php)$">

http://server works !

the term '^.{1,3}$' somehow coincides with the length of the file in the DirectoryIndex, e.g. if I replace i with index.html it must be ^.{1,10}$ to get access ! If it was desired to not let anyone in than this is a security flaw. If not then it is just a too secure apache :-) 
However access is allowed for FilesMatch patterns like "*" or when leaving out the Deny at the beginning.
>How-To-Repeat:
to repeat this problem set include the following:

<FilesMatch "*">
Options Indexes
AllowOverride None
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from All
</FilesMatch>

<Directory />
Options Indexes
AllowOverride None
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from All
</Directory>

<Directory /var/www>
        order allow,deny
        allow from all
        <FilesMatch "\.(html|php|gif|jpeg|jpg|png)$">
                order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </FilesMatch>
</Directory>

and include mod_dir and then try to access the serverroot. it won't work.
>Fix:
it looks as if for entries in DirectoryIndex access is denied before checking the whole new uri (for Alias directives such as Alias /bla /index.html there is no problem)

State-Changed-Why:
It looks to me like you have a misunderstanding of how
<Directory> and <Files> sections are merged in Apache.
A discussion of this issue is available at
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/sections.html

In particular, without spending time to replicate
your configuration in detail, it looks like
the two sets of <FilesMatch> sections are being
evaluated together, the "Order deny,allow" is 
overriding the "Order allow,deny", and therefore
the "Deny from all" is being evaluated last and
denying all access.

If what you want is to deny all access to files
other than those in the docroot with specific 
extensions, then I believe you want something
like (untested):

<Directory />
Order deny,allow
deny from all
</Directory>

<Directory /var/www>
<FilesMatch "\.(html|png|gif|jpeg|jpg|php)$">
allow from all
</FilesMatch>
</Directory>

Thanks for using Apache!

OK, I'm opening this again, because my simplified
configuration also fails.  I've looked into
something similar to this before and I couldn't find
the cause.

State-Changed-Why:

This fails for a very specific reason.  The _filename_ / wasn't permitted before mod_dir ever had a chance to
recover from your misconfiguration.

Drop the <Files "*"> (and don't use FilesMatch anyway for
simple wildcards, since regex processing is far more 
expensive, and * isn't a regex, while .* is).

This was nothing more than a misconfiguration.

 I do not think so. Even after dropping the FilesMatch section ending in a
 simple configuration like
 
 <Directory />
 Order deny,allow
 deny from all
 </Directory>
 
 <Directory /var/www>
 <FilesMatch "\.(html|png|gif|jpeg|jpg|php)$">
 Order allow,deny
 allow from all
 </FilesMatch>
 </Directory>
 
 apache _does_ not allow http://server or http://server/.
 
 This should work, but wrongly http://server is not expanded to
 http://server/index.html and therefore denied !
 
 However I can see any file in matching the specific endings below /var/www/
 when explicitely stating them (http://server/index.html)
 
 Moreover I do not see why
 
 <FilesMatch "^...$|\.(html|php|gif|jpeg|jpg|png|js|css|jar)$">
 
 allows http://server and not  ^.$
 
 
 As it is now, I can not protect the web server (denying all directory access
 and selectively allowing files with specific fileendings in certain
 directories and below) and allowing http://server ! If you can please tell
 me how.
 
 
 Thanks for paying attention,
 Soeren.
