  CEO Gary Heesch announced today a marketing campaign directed to physicia=

 eatment therapies by logging on to the <b>&quot;X Acne&quot; link at the P=
 hysician Search website</b>. This physician search Web site typically rece=
 ives over <b>200,000 hits per month</b>. Mr. Heesch reminded, &quot;Our tr=

 t products come in kit form providing a 90-day supply to patients for the =

 eradication in excess of 90% with no side effects of any consequence</b>. =
 Previously, these therapies and associated products were only available th=
 rough the two prototype clinics in Utah. The availability of these product=
 s will open the way for family practitioners, pediatricians, internists an=
 d other primary care physicians to retain their patients under their care =
