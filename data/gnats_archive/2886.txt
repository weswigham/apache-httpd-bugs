HP-UX miro B.10.20 A 9000/715
>Description:
When client of our server downloads file test.gz our 
Web-server sends it as test (extension is missed). 

When client downloads file test.gz1 test.gz1 our 
Web-server sends it as test.gz1 (extension is not changed ). 

When client downloads file test.ps.gz test.ps.gz our Web-server sends it as
test.ps.gz (extension is not changed . 

  I would like to force our server to send files with 
extension .gz as is without change its name but I didn't
find the way to reach it.

Our configuration:

1) Our mime.types file contain line
application/x-gzip

(extension is missed)
2) Our srm.conf file contains lines
# DefaultType is the default MIME type for documents which the server
# cannot find the type of from filename extensions.

#DefaultType text/plain
DefaultType application/octet-stream

# AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers (Mosaic/X 2.1+) uncompress
# information on the fly. Note: Not all browsers support this.

#AddEncoding x-compress Z
#AddEncoding x-gzip gz

# AddLanguage allows you to specify the language of a document. You can
# then use content negotiation to give a browser a file in a language
# it can understand.  Note that the suffix does not have to be the same
# as the language keyword --- those with documents in Polish (whose
# net-standard language code is pl) may wish to use "AddLanguage pl .po" 
# to avoid the ambiguity with the common suffix for perl scripts.

AddLanguage en .en
AddLanguage fr .fr
AddLanguage de .de
AddLanguage da .da
AddLanguage el .el
AddLanguage it .it

# LanguagePriority allows you to give precedence to some languages
# in case of a tie during content negotiation.
# Just list the languages in decreasing order of preference.

State-Changed-Why:
First, 1.2.0 is very obsolete.  It is clearly stated that
we can't support ancient versions.

It would be useful if you included just what "client" you mean;
ie. what browsers show this behaviour.

Change the DefaultType probably isn't what you really
want to do.  You have your server configured to send
.gz files as text/html.  Simply remove the configuration
for sending them as text/html and configure it to send
them as application/x-gzip.  Anything beyond that is
up to the client; the server doesn't tell it what name
to use.
