>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
I only have a Win 95/98/NT download binary. Run it on HP WIN 98 with
ISDN.
>Description:
Communication error manifested on B1,B1 channel using TCP/IP ISDN.
Modem used is 3com LAN modem. After removing product from registry,
(un-install) ISDN was OK.
>How-To-Repeat:
I suppose I could load Apache server and not touch anything else I am
pretty certain the problem would re-occur.
>Fix:
NO, I am unsure of what happened but there is a sure incompatibility
between Apache Server (on HP WIN 98) using ISDN Internet access.
I have not reserched this any further, just wanted to log and report so
it's known. Apache was working fine at work on win nt (no isdn)
