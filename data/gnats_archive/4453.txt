>Description:
Server has relatively big load (evarage rate is about ~20 hits/sec).
Today I've got following in error_log:

-----------
[Fri May 21 15:46:25 1999] [emerg] (14)Bad address: fcntl: F_SETLKW: Error getting accept lock, exiting!  Perhaps you need to use the LockFile directive to place your lock file on a local disk!
[Fri May 21 15:46:26 1999] [alert] Child 21893 returned a Fatal error...
Apache is exiting!
[Fri May 21 15:50:30 1999] [error] (32)Broken pipe: accept: (client socket)
[Fri May 21 15:50:32 1999] [error] (32)Broken pipe: accept: (client socket)
...

-----------
Since that moment server began to slowdown of request processing, but load increased.
This server has MaxClients 200, and I often see that all child are busy, but even in that situation there is no swaping and no big load.

At 16:11 Linux gone down (or may be in swap?).
Uptime was about a month, and I don't see any other reasons for server to go down.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.	
>Fix:
In fact, I think that error message is Linux bug, but all that came after it
is sertanly apache bug. I do think it is nessesary to test and correct Apache 
behavour in case of such error.

 I'm not sure that your classification is correct. I think error is in Apache
 behavour in case of this error (that in brings OS down). This behavour identical
 for all OS, not only Linux. If you what, you can simulate this error in any OS
 and trace how Apache works. Sorry, I don't well understand this part of Apache
 to test it myself.
