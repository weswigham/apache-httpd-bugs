Apache was built with:
% ./configure 
--enable-so \
--prefix=/home/httpd/apache2 \
--with-mpm=perchild

PHP was built with:
% ./configure \
--with-apxs2=/home/httpd/apache2/ \
--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql

/*
   The build fails during make with a warning about the number of arguments
   passed to ap_get_brigade.
   I removed the 4th argument from the call to ap_get_brigade on line
   248 of php-4.0.6RC2/sapi/apache2filter/sapi_apache2.c

   Sascha Schumann says:
   PHP 4.0.5 already reflects API changes in Apache.  Removing
   the argument on line 248 makes it work with older versions.

% make

% make install
>Description:
Apache fails without an error message after serving a few requests for PHP files. I have error logging set to the debug level - no error message appears in error_log that relates to the server failing -- only to it restarting.

I can provide the PHP scripts if desired. They operate well on older versions of Apache, as well as Xitami and IIS.
