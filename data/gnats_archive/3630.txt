>Description:
If you use Apache to automatically generate a fancy index, it will auto-
matically give you icons for various files and types.  If the file ends
with the string "core," apache assumes it is a core file and sends back
the bomb icon be default; in my example, this "file" is actually a unix
directory named "mscore."
>How-To-Repeat:
I have a directory that contains the two directories:

  drwxr-xr-x   2 russell  staff       1024 Oct  7 23:01 mscore/
  drwxr-xr-x   2 russell  staff       1024 Oct  7 23:01 mscores/

Browsing this directory using the Apache web server (ie. fancy indexing),
the first directory has a "bomb" as its icon while the second has a
folder.

In my srm.conf file, the following lines appear:

  Line 56: AddIcon /icons/bomb.gif core
  Line 60: AddIcon /icons/folder.gif ^^DIRECTORY^^


Changing the order in which they appear in the config file does not
fix the problem.
>Fix:
File types or magic numbers should override names in all cases.

file this in the "mod_autoindex" sucks category for future

 The long and short of the answer is that this is a side effect of the code working as designed.
 There is good reason for it to work this way and the "core" file side effect cannot be eliminated
 without putting special purpose "core" code into general purpose indexing code or removing otherwise
 useful function.
 
 The mod_autoindex code is written to allow a user to specify the use of an icon other than the
 default folder icon for directories. If you wanted to create a special "folder" icon that showed a
 folder with a movie frame on it to use for a folder of type *.movies containing all your quicktime
 movies you can do that (AddIcon /icons/moviefolder.gif .movies). The code that causes the "problem"
 that you describe is in the file apache/src/modules/standard/mod_autoindex.c in the function
 make_autoindex_entry around line 940 (the "offending" lines follow):
 
             if (S_ISDIR(rr->finfo.st_mode)) {
                 if (!(p->icon = find_icon(d, rr, 1))) {
                     p->icon = find_default_icon(d, "^^DIRECTORY^^");
                 }
                 if (!(p->alt = find_alt(d, rr, 1))) {
                     p->alt = "DIR";
                 }
                 p->size = -1;
                 p->name = ap_pstrcat(r->pool, name, "/", NULL);
             }
             else {
                 p->icon = find_icon(d, rr, 0);
                 p->alt = find_alt(d, rr, 0);
                 p->size = rr->finfo.st_size;
             }
 
 This code will first check if the entry is a directory. If it is not, it follows the normal
 find_icon lookup (find_icon then find_alt). If it is a directory, it first does a find_icon (where
 it would find the ".movies" match or in this case the "core" match). If it doesn't find a specific
 match then it loads the default directory folder icon. Regardless of the selected icon, the index
 entry will still behave as a directory when clicked on.
 
 You have stumbled on a side effect of the pre-specified "core" entry in the icon list. Since "core"
 is the full file name (no extension to match) it does not contain a ".". This allows it to match any
 text ending in "core" (i.e.. "mscore"). You won't normally run into this problem because all of the
 other default values are specified as ".something" and most people don't specify directories with
 ".XXX" extensions that match normal file types (like ".tar").
 
 So I hope you can see that there really isn't anything that can be done about this.
 
 Perhaps in the future the AddIcon entries can be changed to a regular expression that (in this case)
 would say something like:
 AddIcon /icon/bomb.gif (eq("core") && !(DIRECTORY))
 but that isn't the way it works today.
