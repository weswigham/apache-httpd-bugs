In the "<!--#if expr=" clause, the $ ('end of line') is not matched on Linux.
It is matched, however, on Sun4 machine.

The HTML code is as following:

<!--#if expr="$DOCUMENT_URI = /^\/~[a-z]*$/" -->
<h1>IF</h1>
<!--#else -->
<h1>ELSE</h1>
<!--#endif -->

Here is the URL on Linux machine ($ is not matched):

Here is the same file on Sun4 machine ($ is matched correctly):

State-Changed-Why:
I can't reproduce it on a libc5 machine... which doesn't mean
that it isn't a problem on a glibc box like your redhat box.
Did you build apache on your own?  Or is it the prepackaged
rpm from RedHat?  Did you change the Rule WANTHSREGEX ?

Have you tried rebuilding everything with optimization turned

 The default is yes.
 
 Did you try compiling without optimization?

 That's cool though, you've eliminated the regex library as a source of the
 problem... lemme see if I can find something else for you to try.

 Try this...  I screwed up during the security patches in 1.2.5.  I've
 already committed this fix to 1.2.7-dev and 1.3b8-dev.  Tell me if it does
 the job for you.
