State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly a problem with your Linux 
installation.  It often comes from upgrading part of 
your system without upgrading it all (compiler, libraries,
include files).  Be sure that the versions on all of these
are matched correctly and you followed all the instructions
for installing the compiler/libraries/etc.

If you still can not resolve it, ask on one of the linux
newsgroups.  This is not really an Apache issue.
