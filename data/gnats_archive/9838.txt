>Description:
 I get the same sort of behaviour under FreeBSD 4.3 and MacOSX. If the 
 file  is missing or does not have public permissions, Either the Error 
 or TransferLog. Apache refuses to start up. If there is only one error, 
 it will give me an error message, but if there are more than one it just 
 returns the prompt and never launches. I have to comment out the Log 
 entried for all the virtual host and dump to a central file. That may be 
 the best way to go anyway. The buggy part is that Apache quits with no 
 error. It should handle the files not being there or having wrong 
 permissions more gracefully.
