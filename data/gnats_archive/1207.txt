State-Changed-Why:
1. Why do say that Apache is still running? How many "Apache" processes
   can you see in the taskman view? Is it still listed in
   Services (remember you have to exit and restart the Services window
   to get it to update the display). When you do "telnet localhost X"
   (where X is the port Apache is using) do you get to Apache (not,
   for example, IIS or PWS)? Note that Apache may take a few seconds
   to finish running after you try and kill it.

2. Use Apache -u to uninstall the service.
