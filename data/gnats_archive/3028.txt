State-Changed-When: Fri Sep 18 09:14:33 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
First, as we clearly ask you should be including the
relevant contents of the error log in your bug report.

Second, the problem in this case is that you haven't
written a proper CGI.  The headers are supposed to be
terminated by a blank line, not a line with a space on it.
