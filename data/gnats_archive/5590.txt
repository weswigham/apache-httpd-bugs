I just installed linux and the apache server for the first time...saw that there was an upgrade available so 
I upgraded to the newer version...as soon as I reboot I get scriptalias takes two arguments a fake name and a
real name.  It informs me that this is in line 367  of the httpd.conf file.

I would hate to have to reinstall yet again to resolve this issue cause it is what I did the last time to see
that just maybe it was my lack of inexperience in linux that caused the problem.

For some reason tho I can hit the website from another pc tho it does say it failed
on boot up...you can attempt to check http://24.9.150.5 and/or http://24.9.150.5/index.html to attempt
to see any problems.

 Hi,
 
 ScriptAlias directive takes 2 arguments:
 Syntax: ScriptAlias url-path directory-filename
 
 URLs with a path beginning with url-path will be
 mapped to scripts beginning with
 directory-filename. 
 Example: 
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/
 
 A request for http://myserver/cgi-bin/foo would cause
 the server to run the script
 /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/foo which is the real name
 of the directory where the file exists.
 
 In the httpd.conf file in line 367 where you got the
 error change the ScriptAlias directive
 to take 2 arguments as specified above and start the
 apache server.
 
 regards,
 vsolve_apache
