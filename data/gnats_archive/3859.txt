OS: Solaris 2.5.1
PL: current
COMP: gcc 2.7.2.1
Apache V: 1.3.4 (however, we've had similar problems with previous releases)
>Description:
Problem 1)
  This problem has been reported in PR687 and PR771 (minimally) and has still
not been resolved.  The problem is that tmpXXX files are left in the top level
cache directory.  As these files accumulate, performance starts to suffer.
Errors such as:

httpd: [Mon Feb  8 18:51:18 1999] [error] (16)Device busy: proxy: error deleting
 temp file /cache/tmpa003oa

Are reported in error_log

Problem 2)

  Cache cleanup does not seem to work on "large" drives.  I do not know what
constitutes large but we have one installation of 1G for cache where the 
cleanup works but our 4G cache partition overflows, no matter how small
the CacheSize is set to (this is another previously reported bug, forget the
PR but it is closed and obviously not resolved).  The cache grows without
bound until the volume fills up.

Problem 3)

 This could be related to the two above problems.  Lots of errors of the 
following sort in error_log (IE megabytes worth)

httpd: [Mon Feb  8 18:43:00 1999] [error] (17)File exists: proxy: error linking 
cache file /cache/tmpa003op to /cache/2/J/_/cHayrHDwvm8tcfVg7YA
httpd: [Mon Feb  8 18:43:03 1999] [error] (17)File exists: proxy: error linking 
cache file /cache/tmpa003pl to /cache/Q/V/r/vfeiR710h@UZIzf5BRA
>How-To-Repeat:
Duplicate my config and try.  I'm doing nothing unusual.  Available for
further help if needed.

State-Changed-Why:
It seems that two different errors are mixed in this PR.
a) [error] (17)File exists: proxy: error linking cache file
This error can occur under normal situations when two
requests to the same URL happen in parallel (two proxy
children). A better concept of "shared memory interprocess
request table" between proxy children might resolve
this (not anytime soon...).

b) [error] (16)Device busy:
Hmmm. What can apache do about that? It seems to be an
error in your OS. All the proxy does is call unlink(name).
If Solaris can't handle that, then.... :-(
Also, I don't see how apache can be involved in
the inability to handle large disks, other than the fact
that one GC must have terminated before the next one starts.
Did you observe any core dumps? Beware, there might be no
log message about it (GC is detached!). Try to trigger a 
GC by touching 0101010170 cache/.time and watch the
background process. Recently in 1.3.7-dev, we had a
core dump candidate.
Try to report any findings. Thank you.

Comment-Added:
Oops! I should have read PR#3233 first. Yes, large disks
will make problems when you configure a CacheSize with
more than 2 gig. I'll fix it RSN.
