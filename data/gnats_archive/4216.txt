>Description:
i try to use REXX (OREXX from IBM) as cgi language and got the following errors:

[Fri Apr 09 14:16:55 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] d:/apache/scripts/ww.rex is not executable; ensure interpreted scripts have "#!" first line
[Fri Apr 09 14:16:55 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: d:/apache/scripts/ww.rex

inside a REXX-script there is no need to specify "#!" like in perl - that would cause a syntax error by the interpreter

the association from the script-extension (.rex) to the interpreter (REXX.EXE)
is configured well in WindowsNT!
>How-To-Repeat:
try to use an other cgi-script-language than perl ("#!")
>Fix:
it seems like it is fix coded in (W32-)apache to work only with perl as cgi language?!

Comment-Added:
Have you tried using the new ScriptInterpreterSource directive?

Another option is to encapsulate the rexx script in a .bat file.
