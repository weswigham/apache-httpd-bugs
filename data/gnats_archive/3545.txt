RedHat Linux 5.1:
Linux student.kgv.edu.hk 2.0.36 #1 Tue Nov 17 13:01:19 EST 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
I have private user folders set up across two partitions:
/home1/userid and /home2/userid
This is not readable by anyone else due to security reasons. (as its chmod 711)
To setup user homepages, I need to make a publicly readable folder called 'web', so I need to do:
UserDir ../web/*
in srm.conf. However, when I do http://student.kgv.edu.hk/~jchan, it looks for /home1/jchan/../web/jchan/ = /home1/web/jchan/ which exists (tested with bash), but apache says it doesn't exist.
>How-To-Repeat:
By setting up as above. I cannot do UserDir /home1/web as there are TWO partitions.
>Fix:
Yes. Something wrong with the pathname lookup.
Please reply. This is urgent and I need it working ASAP.
