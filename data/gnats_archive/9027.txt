>Environment:
NetBSD www 1.5.2 NetBSD 1.5.2 (GENERIC) #3: Sat Aug 18 23:37:05 CEST 2001     he@hamster.urc.uninett.no:/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC i386

IPV6 enabled.
apache configured with only --prefix=<install path>

>Description:
The problem appears twofold:

by default apache only listens on IPV6 addresses on netbsd

Setting explicitly in httpd.conf to listen on IPV4 ports produces errors like:

Cannot open "<path to here>/httpd-2_0_28/srclib/apr-util/xml/expat/lib/.libs/libexpat.so"
<path to here>/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

For some reason apache doesn't look for the .so file in the installed hierarchy but (thwartedly) in a  version of the source hierarchy. 

Creating the necessary links in the source hierarchy allows aapche start and function.

I'm unable to safely navigate the sources to correct this.
>How-To-Repeat:
A fresh off-the-net installation of netBSD 1.5.2 for i386 with IPV6 enabled. Apche
>Fix:
Preferably have apache listen for both IPV4 & 6 ports.

Or at least look for dynamically loaded libs the right place :-)

State-Changed-Why:
Allegedly listening sockets and implicit library loads are unrelated :)  We'll have to figure out what leads to this bewildering symptom.  

Is it perhaps that depending on your socket configuration you may or may not hit the same failure path?

Did you run the newly-built, uninstalled version of Apache/apr/apr-util in one trial (i.e., one listen statement) but the installed version in another trial 
(i.e., two listen statements)?

The generic advice for library load problems is to make 
sure you have the latest/greatest libtool.  We've found that on several
platforms libtool 1.4.2 is necessary for Apache/apr/apr-util.  libtool is responsible for the nitty gritty details
of building shared libraries.

As for listening sockets:

It is a known limitation/restriction/problem/whatever that you need two Listen statements on netbsd 

  Listen 0.0.0.0:80
  Listen [::]:80

so that Apache gets both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets, whereas on
most platforms with IPv6 you need only

  Listen 80
or
  Listen *:80

since on those other systems only one socket is necessary.

There is an open PR for this (7492)with no agreed-upon resolution (but with the easy work-around mentioned above).

I think you should stick to the two Listen statements mentioned above while you determine what the load failure
might be.

My apologies (especially to aaron!)...  That was 
trawick@apache.org which just updated the PR.  I neglected
to fix the editor field.  Sorry!
