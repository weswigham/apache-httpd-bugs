>Description:
when apache server's service starts, the vhosts doesn't function well. when I try to log into some vhosts, I get to my main host, and nothing helps (it's a name-based vhost on one IP).
after running 'apache -k restart' , the vhost work great, but after my computer restarts (for example, wheh the computer is stucked, or when the electricity runs off), it doesn't work again, and I have to run 'apache -k restart' again...
>How-To-Repeat:
perry.org.il is the main domain, and superboss.co.il is the vhost.
>Fix:
no

State-Changed-Why:

Do the DocumentRoot or Alias directories in the affected 
vhosts reside on this machine, or on another network drive?
If they are on the network, please read:

http://www.apache.org/websrc/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/apache-1.3/htdocs/manual/win_service.html?rev=1.2

And follow the procedures outlined for service dependencies,
but modify the DependsOnService list to include Netlogon,
which will assure all services required to access remote
services have already started.

Also, I presume it's not a user access issue since upon
restart you -do- get the proper vhosts, but those notes
also include running the service as another user, which
may help you.  But if this were the issue, it shouldn't
restart any more effectively than when it starts in the
first place.

Please respond if this solves your problem.

 the service runs automatically as Administrator, and the restart procedure
 (-k restart) also as Administrator.

 sorry, but it didn't...

 Did you follow the directions I recommended at the link
 to the win_service.html file to fix the service dependencies?
 
 That seems to be the last remaining obvious problem.
 The service dependencies will be configured for you after
 Apache version 1.3.13, but you must do so by editing
 the registry until then.

Comment-Added:

As Saar and I have trying to wring this problem out... with
no success, I'm not bothering to put the long list of 
unsucessfull diagnostics into the list.  Please try the very
soon to come revision 1.3.13, and see if that does not
solve this problem.

State-Changed-Why:

User reports that defining <VirtualHost hostname> without
a connection to any DNS server killed the DNS resolution
of the virtual host.  <VirtualHost ipaddr> resolves the
problem encountered.
