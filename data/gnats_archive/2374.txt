SCO_SV 3.2 2 i386
>Description:
the fn. common_init (ln.3231/file http_main.c) is defined as common_init().
it uses argc,argv.
here's the relevent code snip.
----------              
static void common_init()
{
    INIT_SIGLIST()
#ifdef AUX3
    (void) set42sig();
#endif

#ifdef SecureWare
    if (set_auth_parameters(argc, argv) < 0)
------------
I don't know what the #ifdef SecureWare is for.:(
>How-To-Repeat:
I've got the source on 7jun1998 from http://www.apache.org/dist/apache_1.3.0.tar.Z

the pb. should be there in that.
>Fix:
// The compile went thru when changed to accept argc,argv.
static void common_init(int argc,char *argv[])
{
    INIT_SIGLIST()
#ifdef AUX3
    (void) set42sig();
#endif

#ifdef SecureWare
    if (set_auth_parameters(argc, argv) < 0)

This is already fixed for 1.3.1. The SecureWare
stuff was moved from common_init to REALMAIN.
Thanks for your report.
