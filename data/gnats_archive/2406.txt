>Release:        1.3b7
>Environment:
Installed Apache 1.3b7 on NT workstation 4.0 .  Browsing the web using
Netscape 4.X from  NT.
>Description:
The first HTML page defines a call-back . Click the call-back , a CGI function
is called and the output text file ( non HTML file, it is *.igs ) is publish
using   " Location: URL "  by the cgi function.

On browser side, a DOS window is opened and the every singal line in the text file
is taken as a DOS command ( in other word, the text file is processed as a DOS
script file even the helper is defined to handle this file type ) .

MIME.TYPES file was correctly setup to support this file type ( .igs ) .
>How-To-Repeat:
Define a call-back like

<A HREF=URL/cgi-bin/function ... > ...</A>

In the program "function" , publish a text file "test.igs" like

Location: URL/test.igs

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 10 09:37:53 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
First, CGI scripts to not function properly in 1.3b7 as
listed very clearly on the known bugs page you are told
to read.

Second, HTML pages can not define "call backs" and it makes
no sense to say you "publish" a file from a CGI.

If your client is running the commands as a batch file, then
it is horribly misconfigured and should not be used on any network.

Please try with 1.3.0 when released; if it still doesn't work,
and you are sure it is a bug in Apache (please, read the page
presented before you go to submit a PR) then let us know, if
you can describe what you are doing and what is happening
more clearly.

Does accessing the file work if you access it directly without
the CGI?
