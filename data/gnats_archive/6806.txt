hp vectra XU 6/200 dual ppro 200 64M, debian 2.2 (std install)
Linux oli252 2.2.17-smp #5 SMP Fri Nov 3 08:22:41 CET 2000 i686 unknown
gcc 2.95.2
>Description:
when done with..
root@oli252 apache_1.3.14# SSL_BASE=/usr/bin/openssl ./configure --with-layout=config.mylayout:conf --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a --server-uid=www --server-gid=www --enable-module=ssl
after installing the mod_ssl-2.7.1-1.3.14 patches with 
cd <mod_ssl> ; ./configure --with-apache=../<apache>, and php4.0.3pl1 Stuff
(i had to compile it static, wouldn't build as dso. first apxs.pl wasn't +x, 
then the #! was wrong, then php4 tried to pass it Wrong Arguments, then i gave up),
the Makefile in src/ looks like this:
##
##  Apache Makefile, automatically generated by Configure script.
##  Hand-edited changes will be lost if the Configure script is re-run.
##  Sources: - ./Makefile.config (via Configuration.apaci)
##           - ./Makefile.tmpl
##

(EOF)
>How-To-Repeat:
see above.
oh, config.mylayout is a mix of :Apache and :Redhat, don't think it's relevant
but if you want it.. http://www2.oli.tudelft.nl/jp/config.mylayout.
>Fix:
for me, get some sleep and possibly an other httpd.
for you? you figure it out.
