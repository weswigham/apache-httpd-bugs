>Description:
I can not seem to get Perl (5.003 and/or 5.004_01) script support installed. I tried CPAN install Bundle::Apache and the moduels separate, but it will not work!
Do you have another option for me?

This is a support question, so it's not a repeatable problem...

Incorporate Perl support in het next release ;-%2

State-Changed-When: Sun Jul  6 16:17:57 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, we have nothing to do with external perl modules
and so we can't support it.  You need to ask in an
appropriate newsgroup or contact the authors of the
packages in question.
