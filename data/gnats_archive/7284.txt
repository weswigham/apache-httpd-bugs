I first tried the binary install, but it failed.
Then I tried to compile (configure), but it also failed :
Would it be better if I use gcc ?

Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html. If you don't
wish to do the port yourself, please submit this output rather
than the patches. Thank you.
 
Pressing on with the build process, but all bets are off.
Do not be surprised if it fails. If it works, and even
if it does not, please contact the above address.

** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration

 OK, I've installed the 1.3.17 version, and it installed (just one small
 error, see at the end of this mail)
 
 But when I start it, it does nothing :
 # /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
 /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd
 started                                                                  =
       =
 
 
 If I look for a wwwrun user in /etc/passwd, there is none
 In fact, /etc/passwd has not been modified at all !! Shouldn't it ?
 
 In fact, apache fails to run :

 Here is what I have done :
 1) ./configure --prefix=3D/usr/local/apache
 2) make
 3) make install
 
 The small error I've had is during the "make install" (chown error on
 proxy/ dir)
 Here are the output messages :
