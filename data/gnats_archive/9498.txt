>Release:        1.3.22
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 2000; Cygwin 1.3.6-6; PHP 4.1.1 w/ PostgreSQL support (not by choice! no mySQL port for Cygwin, from what I can find!  Long story of why I have to use Cygwin.)
>Description:
I was trying to install PHP4 w/ PostgreSQL support statically in httpd on Cygwin.  Build would fail on "dllwrap" command because of "undefined reference" errors for "PQ*" in the PHP library.  I was able to work around the problem by adding "-lpq -lpostgres" to EXTRA_LIBS and modifying Makefile LD_SHLIB command to include $EXTRA_LIBS.

Exact command sequence:

<extracted apache and php source files>
cd apache_1.3.22
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=so

cd ../php-4.1.1
./configure --with-pgsql=/usr --with-apache=../apache_1.3.22  --enable-track-vars --disable-xml
make
make install

cd ../apache_1.3.22
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=so  --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a
make

<all would compile>
<dllwrap command would fail>
>How-To-Repeat:
See command list in description.
>Fix:
Add $(EXTRA_LIBS) to the $(LD_SHLIB) command in Makefile.

 this is unnecessary when you are using --with-rule=SHARED_CORE in
 combination with --enable-module=so.
 
 Please close the state.
