>Description:
If a request includes the header:

    If-Match: "abc def"

the code will do completely the wrong thing.  It treats this as two tokens
rather than one.  The bug isn't in find_token(), the bug is in
meets_conditions() which shouldn't be using find_token().  Another function,
maybe called find_quoted_string() should be added and used.

State-Changed-Why:

But, since we generate our own etags and know they do not
contain any whitespace, it doesn't matter. Anything containing
a space would never match one of our etags.

It would be nice to have a find_value function that separated
a field by the comma list items, removed extra whitespace,
and then did a smart comparison.
