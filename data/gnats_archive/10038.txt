Solaris 8 (Sparc)
gcc 2.95.3
>Description:
the configure and compile steps work fine, without any error, but I can't start apache 1.3.23 :

./apachectl start
Syntax error on line 211 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_negotiation.so into server: ld.so.1: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_negotiation.so: symbol __floatdisf: referenced symbol not found
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

I don't see any error syntax error in httpd.conf (generated during the make step).

Here is the configure command :

EAPI_MM="/usr/local/mm" \
SSL_BASE="/usr/local/ssl" \
./configure \
--with-layout=Apache \
--prefix=/usr/local/apache \
--enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max \
--enable-module=ssl \
--enable-shared=ssl \
--activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
--enable-module=perl \
--activate-module=src/modules/auth_mysql/libauth_mysql.a


I saw such problems in the bug reports database (PR 7326, 7590), but I don't know if they got any solution.

State-Changed-By: aaron
State-Changed-When: Tue Mar  5 07:45:31 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
This is a common error caused by the interaction of
an improperly compiled gcc 2.95.x and its implicit use of
the Solaris linker (ld).

There are a few possible solutions to this:
1) Rebuild gcc to use the gnu assembler from the gnu utils package.
2) Rebuild gcc to pass the proper implicit paths to the Solaris linker, specifically the path to libgcc.a
3) (Quick Workaround) Simply add the following output to your LDFLAGS variable before running configure:
`gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

Details:
The gcc compiler is introducing symbols into compiled object files that are only available in libgcc.a, but
does not explicitly identify this library to the underlying linker. Unless gcc was explicitly built with
this implicit pathname, this error will occur.
