>Environment:
Intel Pentium
Linux
Slackware distribution
kernel version 2.0.29
Apache 1.2.0 source
gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
There is a file called /usr/include/i386/jmp_buf.h missing from Slackware Linux
(maybe other dists too?). When make tries to compile alloc.c it complains about
the missing file and quits. Here is the calling relationship:

alloc.c -> conf.h -> /usr/include/setjmp.h -> /usr/include/jmp_buf.h ->
/usr/include/i386/jmp_buf.h

I can't find the last file anywhere on my hard drive. I have the latest
Slackware CD from Walnut Creek, so I searched for the file there also.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to compile 1.2.0 on Linux 2.0.x.
>Fix:
Find that /usr/include/i386/jmp_buf.h file

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a problem with Apache; we can do nothing
about your OS not being installed correctly.  There are
so many different versions of Linux; you really have to ask
your question on a Linux newsgroup.
