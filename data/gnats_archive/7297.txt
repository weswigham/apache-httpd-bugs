FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE, GENERIC kernel.
>Description:
All the files compiled fine with little error. But when they tried to
link, I received this error.

server/mpm/threaded/.lib/libthreaded.a(threaded.o): In function 'child_main':
/usr/glimpse/home/httpd-2.0/server/mpm/threaded/threaded.c(.text+0x9cd): undefin
ed reference to 'apr_setup_signal_thread'
/usr/glimpse/home/httpd-2.0/server/mpm/threaded/threaded.c(.text+0xab3): undefin
ed reference to 'apr_create_signal_thread'
>How-To-Repeat:
Umm, download current CVS from scratch and compile..
>Fix:
Looking through the mailing list, I noticed someone submitted a patch
to make use of the apr_X_signal_thread functions. Maybe at one point the
people using the patch had that function, but its not in the current CVS.

State-Changed-Why:
The problem is that you are trying to compile without thread
support.  We have found that threads and FreeBSD do not
mix well, so we have disabled threads by default on all
FreeBSD platforms.  To have those functions defined, you
will need to add --enable-threads to your configure line.

Thank you for using Apache.
