>Description:
The following (contained within VirtualHost) should deny access to the docroot for everyone except 128.66.12.2:

<Directory />
Options None
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
</Directory>

<Directory "/SomeFilesystem/SomeDocroot">
Options FollowSymLinks IncludesNoExec
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
Allow from 128.66.12.2
</Directory>

Unfortunately, it just denies access to everyone, including 128.66.12.2.

The workaround is to remove the "Deny from all" from the second Directory directive:

<Directory />
Options None
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
</Directory>

<Directory "/SomeFilesystem/SomeDocroot">
Options FollowSymLinks IncludesNoExec
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
#Deny from all
Allow from 128.66.12.2
</Directory>

In which case, the desired behavior is achieved. The end result is the same, but the ambiguity caused me about an hour of frustration. Additionally, the mod_access docs seem to support the idea the the first example above should work.

State-Changed-Why:
Look at the docs for the order directive.  You have
"order allow,deny" which says start out with everything
denied, then allow access from those in the allow list
then deny access from those in the denied list.

This results in the state being denied -> allowed -> denied,
which is a final state of denied.

If you don't want this, you can use "order deny,allow"
