>Description:
When testing with dynamically created html pages, it seems that `ab'
only measures the size of the document after the first time it receives the
page:
if (good == 1) {
   doclen = c->bread;
}

The `Content-length' header seems to be ignored, so that the different
sizes will contribute to the `failed request' statistics; e.g.:

Failed requests:        26
   (Connect: 0, Length: 26, Exceptions: 0)

- even if the server is working perfectly well.
