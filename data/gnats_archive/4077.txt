>Description:

When using an * in the directory directive, as in 
<Directory /*/public_html>  It does not work.
The following works under Solaris: <Directory /home/*/public_html>
and under linux: <Directory ~ /*/public_html>

No error messages are generated, even with the debug loglevel.

State-Changed-Why:
I don't know exactly what you think "doesn't work", but
/*/public_html is only supposed to match all second level
directories named public_html.

It does not match /home/user/public_html.  It would match
/user/public_html.
