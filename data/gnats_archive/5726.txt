>Description:
When I do a GET method request (let's say 
http://mysite.com/servlets/myServlet?param1=test1&param2=test2), the 
request.getParameter("param1") method, getQueryString() method and every methods
that accesses the request parameters always return null. Although, it's working
fine with a POST request. It is not a problem in the code since I tried several
example servlets i got from the net and they all had the same problem.
I'm compiling the servlets using jdk1.2.2 and jsdk2.1. I run several CGIs (c++)
on the same web and they don't have that problem.

Since it is surely a misconfiguration on my side, I can't answer that.

 Here is your problem... JSDK2.1... JServ requires JSDK2.0.

 I just downloaded JSDK2.0, installed it, changed the CLASSPATH, recompiled 
 the servlets and I get the same behavior. (with post, getParameter works 
 fine but on a GET request, always returns null).
 Any ideas?
