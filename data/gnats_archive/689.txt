doc bug	
>Description:
The documentation disagrees with itself as to whether AddType needs a dot on
the extension.  For example, http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html
claims you need ".shtml", but http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/compat_notes.html
claims there should be no dot.  Also, compat_notes claims only one extention
per line, but http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#addtype lists the
syntax as multiple extensions on the line (and shows things with no dot, but
does not explicitly prohibit it).

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: pcs
State-Changed-When: Sat Jun  7 05:18:10 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The dot is optional (both .shtml and shtml are equivalent) 

so the docs show examples both with and without dots. 


The AddType directive (like the other Add* directives) 

allows multiple extensions. The compatibility note refers 

to a (very old) previous verison of Apache. It will be 

updated. 


Thanks for noticing these errors.
