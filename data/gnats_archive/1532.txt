Server   : Solaris 2.4 with all suggested patches
Compiler : gcc 2.7.2.3 using GNU as and GNU ld
>Description:
I would find it useful if a separate set of log file could be defined for
mod_proxy. Would it be an idea to make mod_proxy implement a special type of
virtual host? E.g.:

<VirtualHost _proxy_>
   ErrorLog     ...
   TransferLog  ...
</VirtualHost>
