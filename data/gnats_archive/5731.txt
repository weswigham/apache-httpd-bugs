>Description:
I add a counter with the SSI directive:
<--!#totcnt-->
But with Netscape 4 and IE5 I get the message:An error ocurred while processing 
this directive, and the error log of Apache write: unknown directive "totcnt-->
Other directives that show this problem are:
<--!#daycnt-->  and <--!#lastzero-->.(all related to the count)

However other directives work:
<!--#echo var="SERVER_SOFTWARE"-->
 <!--#echo var="last_modified"-->
I think that the server conf is correct.
There are SSI directives not recognized by Apache?

State-Changed-Why:
The SSI directives which Apache supports are listed
in the mod_include documentation.  The ones you mention are
not among them.
