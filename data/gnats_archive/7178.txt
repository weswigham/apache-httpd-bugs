linux 6.2
>Description:

We are trying to install IBM Websphere advanced edition 

3.0 on Redhat Linux 6.2 version.
We are having oracle8 as database on some other server.
We have loaded jdk118.
We were able to install IBM HTTP server 1.3.6-12.
When we tried to start administrative server we are 

getting the following message in tracefile
"JORB0072 :Port9000 in use.specify different port 

number"
We had stopped samba server which was runing on port 

9000 and again given the comand "startupserver".Even 

then we are getting the same message.
Where to specify different port number for 

administrative server.

How can we overcome this particular problem.
Please give us your valuable sugestion.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, but you will really need to contact IBM with
your problem, since it has nothing to do with
Apache as distributed from our site.

Thanks.
