Microsoft Windows 98 (build 4.10.1998)
Allaire ColdFusion 4.0 Enterprise
>Description:
Apache: could not load module (ColdFusion)

No problems with all the other modules (enclosed with the Apache 1.3.4 package).
>How-To-Repeat:
Just install and try to run Apache 1.3.4 on any Windows system
with ColdFusion 4.0 installed.
>Fix:
Observe the ColdFusion module - it is very big and maybe some additional memory
allocated is needed.

State-Changed-When: Sun Feb 21 14:11:49 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
We can do nothing about this; you have to talk to the people
that make coldfusion.  More likely than not you are trying
to use a module created for a different version of Apache.
