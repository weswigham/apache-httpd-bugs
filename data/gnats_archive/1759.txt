>Environment:
Apache 1.2.5 running on S.U.S.E Linux 2.0.32
>Description:
I tried to process form data with method POST, and used some server parsed
HTML file as ACTION URL within the FORM tag. If the form is submitted, I receive
the error message:

Method Not Allowed

The requested method POST is not allowed for the URL /BGProWeb/BugReports/edit/handle.shtml.

I did not use LIMIT in my access.conf, and anything works fine if I use METHOD GET within
the FORM tag.
Problem: If SSI is used in conjunction with forms and long data (eg Textareas),
POST is required to overcome the 1024 character barrier of method GET.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create some HTML form with METHOD=POST and use some server parsed HTML page
containing exec cgi=xxx.cgi as ACTION URL.
Then submit the form and you will get the error.
>Fix:
Apache should read and store the POST message BODY and replay it to called SSI
programs. Maybe its even possible to store parameters in environment variables
in the same way as for GET on some system

State-Changed-Why:
No, Apache does not and should not allow you to post to
a HTML document.  It really has no meaning.  Just because
there may be a CGI with output included in it does not
mean that the entire thing is a CGI.

There are so many cases where trying to do this simply
doesn't work (eg. multiple CGIs in a include) that I
really don't see it being worthwhile.
