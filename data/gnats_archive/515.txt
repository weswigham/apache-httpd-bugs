I have a simple C program that only prints "yes" but the server just complains
about a malformed header.  Scripts such as the test-cgi that comes with it 
work fine.

State-Changed-Why:
This sounds like an error in your CGI.  Ensure that it prints
the Content-Type header.  Please read the FAQ
(www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html).  The server does not know/care
what your CGI is written in, so there's nothing to enable.

Thanks for using Apache!
