>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Buld 1381, Service Pack 3
>Description:
I downloaded the latest version (1.3.1) of Apache for Win32. When trying
to Install the WebServer, I get an error message "file error: -3" regarding
the file "C:\WINNT\System32\MSVCRT.1" when it is trying to copy the DLL
"MSVCRT.DLL" in that directory. When I click OK, the Install program exits
(I am assuming that the installation is not complete).

The MSVCRT.DLL is in use by Windows and the install program is
unable to overwrite it. I tried to Unload the DLL by using WPS.EXE but
for some reason WPS.EXE does not see this DLL.

There are two earlier bugs in the database regarding this issue. Those bugs
are 1736 and 1676.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The possible fixes are:

Fix 1: Modify the install program so that if the file MSVCRT.DLL exists,
it does not try to overwrite it.

Fix 2: Modify the install program so that if copying of a file fails, it
continues with the rest of the installation. It keeps the files in some temp
area so that they can be copied when the machine is rebooted next time.
Hopefully at that time the DLLs will not be in use.

Personally I like the Fix 1 but Microsoft has known to be very bad in keeping
the DLLs backword compatible so Apache may work only with certain versions of
this DLL.

State-Changed-Why:
I believe most Win32 installs recommend that all
applications be shutdown before proceeding. I am compiling 
a list of Win32 install problems that we've seen in the past.
I hope that folks doing the Win32 Apache builds can
refer to the list and avoid making the same mistakes.
