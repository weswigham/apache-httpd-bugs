This line from util.c

#define TEST_CHAR(c, f) (test_char_table[(unsigned)(c)] & (f))

use wrong cast which make index worse by another way: 8bit chars become too big (consider 0xFFFFFFFF from '\377' char) instead of negative. Proper cast
is (unsigned char) not just (unsigned)! 

Plain (unsigned) cast promote to int first, i.e. makes -1 from '\377' and then convert -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF.

>Fix:
Use (unsigned char) cast instead of just (unsigned)
