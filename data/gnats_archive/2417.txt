>Environment:
NT
>Description:
Files mounted via subst (i.e. "subst P: \\server2\users\me\site")
or files that are mapped to the UNC (Universal naming convention)
of installed device drivers  (i.e. c:\foo\aux.html is mapped to
\\.\aux).   This arises out of the code that attempts to map from
URL thru Unix file names into Window's filenames.  This code get's
confused by these names that have "canonical names" outside the local
machine single letter drive names.
 The failure manifests in various ways, "file not available", or 
"ServerRoot must be a directory", are two examples.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try serving up content from your samba server.
>Fix:
Find sufficently smart and kind person apply until symptoms disappear.
