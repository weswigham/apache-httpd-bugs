>Release:        Apache JServ 1.0b5
>Environment:
Redhat 5.2 & Redhat 6.0
>Description:
I had tried a few examples for creating GIF images, packages from 'http://www.acme.com/resources/classes/Acme.tar.Z'
and code examples from 'http://www.servlets.com/jsp/examples/ch06/HelloWorldGraphics.java'. Lastly, 
I tried it on Linux RedHat 6.0 with jdk1.2v2 from Blackdown.
I can usually create Frame running as application on X Windows. But when used by Servlet as off screen, it requires sun.awt.motif.MToolKit package (logs/error_log and logs/jserv.log)
and returns Internal Error.
>How-To-Repeat:
I try at home and you can at 'http://www.servlets.com/jsp/examples/ch06/HelloWorldGraphics.java'
