Solaris, Linux and probably others
>Description:
The mime.types configuration file should, by default, have the type
  "application/x-javascript .js"
included.  Lack of this type causes problems with included JavaScript files
on Win32 platforms running Netscape Navigator 3.

I ran into the problem after our systems person installed the latest version
of Apache.  After getting reports from Win32/NN3 users of a problem with
a major JavaScript application, we managed to trace the problem to the mime.types
configuration file.

There was another report on comp.lang.javascript recently, so the
problem seems to affect a number of sites.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Simply add the line "application/x-javascript .js" to the distributed
mime.types file.
