>Description:
We have a page here containing many executable server side includes
(representing our graphics) on our site. These server side includes
operate correctly under MSIE v3.02 and Netscape v3/v4.

However, when this website is accessed using Explorer v4 final release,
these server side includes either terminate incorrectly with the text [An error
has occured processing this directive], or the server side includes are
ignored, and are as a result viewable using the browser's "view source" option.

The symptoms manifest themselves in our case by missing graphics on our site, as
these graphic URLs are generated by an SSI program.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a bug in IE 4.0 which Microsoft apparently did not
fix despite being given a very detailed report in the first
week after IE 4.0 PR2 was released.  For workarounds read
the documentation at

 This looks like a problem with your site, not with apache.  When I telnet
 to www.vwv.com port 80 it tells me that my browser doesn't support frames. 
 i.e. you've got a list of what browsers you think support frames and you
 do different things based on that.  So you should be looking at your
 scripts to see that they list MSIE 4 properly.

 What happens when you load the problem frame directly by specifying its
 URL, rather than going to the top page?
