>Description:
On Monday, March 27, I submitted a bug report on `suexec' and the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environmental variables.  I never received an email message
about it, not even an automated reply.  I even referenced another bug number in
this case and now I can't find it any more.  I didn't write down that bug number
for the old case because I figured it would be echoed back in the confirmation
message and I though I could easily find it again.
