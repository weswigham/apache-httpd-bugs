>Description:
This problem has been identified before. I am suggesting a way round it,
until it gets fixed in future versions (see corresponding section).

Although the installation has been completed successfully, the server does not
run. For example, typing "http://localhost/" in the URL bar, does not display
absolutely anything.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Make a shortcut for the restart icon. Right click on this shortcut and select
"Properties". Finally, select "Run in compatibility mode for Win 2000".

On the system I tried it, it worked. The Apache server was then working
properly. I hope I wasn't just the lucky one :-)
