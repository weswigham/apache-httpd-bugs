>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.5, java 1.1.7
>Description:
ApJServSecretKey is evaluated and used by the JVM but not by the apache server.
I startet with the same Secret key for all JVM, defined in the global section
of httpd.conf. This works.
I added the ApJServSecretKey directive (for another file) in a virtual host
section and modified the corresponding property file for the JVM. 
I restartet the JVM. As excpected the further requests failed because of 
authentication failure, because apache was still using the old secret.
Then I restarted apache by with kill -HUP. Now apache should use the new secret
for that virtual host, but it does not.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a virtual host and a JVM for that virtual host. Try using them a 
common secret which is different from the global secret.
>Fix:
Correct the C-Code. For virtual hosts the Secret should be determined from 
the virtual host settings (if available).
