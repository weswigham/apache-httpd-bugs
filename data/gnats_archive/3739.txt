Redhat linux 5.2 linux 2.0 approx
>Description:
After mounting a netware drive, and using the proper login for read only rights, when
apache is configured to use this drive as the home directory it causes the drive
to give an I/O error after httpd is started. 1 solution for this was to use
a symbolic link, and that gets rid of the I/O error but when the web site
is accessed it gives a you do not have rights to / on this server even tho
I have set up rights for the sumbolic link and the directory itself.

State-Changed-Why:
This sounds like a kernel problem, you may get more help
by asking on the appropriate linux mailing list (not sure
which one to ask about the novell stuff).

One thing you might try is to delete the USE_MMAP_FILES
definition from src/include/ap_config.h.

If the problem still occurs, an "strace -f" of apache
showing the problem would be helpful... (but don't mail
it here, stick it at some URL for us to pick up thanks)
