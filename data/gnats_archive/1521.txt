State-Changed-Why:
Please read the FAQ (http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ#fdlim) and
the page on descriptors (http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/descriptors.html).

It is very unlikely that this is a bug in Apache, and this
is asked all the time, zillions of copies in the bugs database
that you should easily be able to find, and is well documented
in the above files.
