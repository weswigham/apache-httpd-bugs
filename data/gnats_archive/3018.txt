State-Changed-Why:

As the documentation states, HEAD is grouped with GET.
Rather than special-casing the currently defined methods,
Apache should be enhanced to allow arbitrary method names
so that extension methods and future HTTP-defined ones
can be handled.  This is on a work-list, but I am
suspending this PR so the issue won't be forgotten.
