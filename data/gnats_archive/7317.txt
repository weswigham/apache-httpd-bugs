>Environment:
Win 2K
>Description:
I am trying to install Apache on a box that runs win 2k.  I go to the Windows page http://httpd.apache.org/docs/windows.html and read this <B> You should download the version of Apache for Windows with the .exe extension. This is a single file containing Apache, ready to install and run. <B/>. So I go to the download page  here http://httpd.apache.org/dist/ -> to look for the .exe file.  It does not exist.  Or I am blind.  Please help with a dog or cane...
