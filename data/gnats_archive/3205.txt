>Description:
This isn't a bug report; it's a feature request. Apologies if this isn't the 
best place to do it.

I've looked through the docs for mod_log_config (as well as the source, briefly)
and I don't see a way to make a log request conditional on anything but the 
status.

What I'm thinking is that it would be nice to either expand the conditions to 
include whether or not another log variable is available (e.g., an environment
variable), and fall back to something else if not.

The reason I ask is that it would be nice to replace the host string when
the environment variable X-FORWARDED-FOR is available, from proxy servers.

That's pretty complex, and probably not too clean to implement. So, perhaps an
extra log field type just for this might be in order to achieve this.

Doing this would have some fairly far-reaching effects for people who used it, 
so I don't know how advisable it is; it just struck me as something that may
be useful for some ppl running non-configurable web logfile analysers, to get
better stats. Just a thought.

Cheers

 I think it would be easier if you just logged to a pipe, then had the
 program you are logging to get a CustomLog with both the X-FORWARDED-FOR
 and the normal client, then use one or the other when it writes logs out
 depending.
 
 Or you could do this in a batch process after the fact.
