>Description:
Hello,
We need to upgrade our solaris version from 2.5.1 to xx. The new version number will depend on all other tools that we use. 

Could you please send me a list of compatibilities between Apache versions and Solaris versions. e.g.:
Solaris 2.5.1    - Apache 1.3.3 to ?
Solaris 2.6      - ??
Solaris 7        - ??
Solaris 8        - ??
Solaris 9 (Beta) - ??

Thanks for your help.
Laurent

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
