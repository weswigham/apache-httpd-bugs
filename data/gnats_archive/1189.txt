>Description:
hi, currently I try to install apache into my Sco Unix Open Server 3.0 but failed. I managed to download apache ver 1.2.0 . These are the steps that I have done.

1. Download apach-SCO3.tar.gz   from www.apache.org/dist/old/binaries/sco/
2. Gunzip it and put in the /apps/apache_1.2.0  directory
3. tar the apach-SCO3.tar
4. Error comes out -- cannot create directory
5. Create the directories manually
6. tar again - success
7. follow the steps recommend in the www.apache.org/dist/old/binaries/sco  
8. when I execute ./httpd  , error No such file or directory.
			     could not open /dev/zero
9. Also do I need to download the httpd-1.2.0-coff-gcc.gz or httpd-1.20-coff-p5.gz? 

Please help.  One more thing , if I get the ver 1.2.4 can I install it in SCO unix Open Server 3.0 ??
Where can I get the gunzip and gcc compiler for Sco unix ??


Please help. I really seek out of resources.

Thanks

Regards

Stephen

State-Changed-Why:
Not having a /dev/zero is somewhat broken, however you are
running an old OS so who knows what it does.

You will need to recompile your own binary from the sources.

You can find gcc binaries in the Skunkware software package
available for ftp from SCO, however you will have to look
to see if you can find any applicable to your version.
