From time to time I'm getting this exception:

org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.getDateHeader(JServConnection.java:1242)

Looking at the code I think I've nailed the problem. Both the
"setDateHeader()" and "getDateHeader()" methods use the default 
SimpleDateFormat constructor which in turn uses the default locale.
This results in ApJServ writing or looking for localized
Day/Month abbreviations (the rest is fine) while the HTTP
Date headers use only English.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The locale used in SimpleDateFormat() should be specified explicitly:

> new SimpleDateFormat(<whatever>, Locale.US)
