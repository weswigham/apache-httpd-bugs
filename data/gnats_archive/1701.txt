>Environment:
This problem was discovered under RedHat 5.0 with linux 2.0.33 and also works
with irix 6.3. In both cases compiled with gcc. 
>Description:
If we set UserDir to an absolute path (UserDir /home/web/ for example) then
apache just adds username to this directory (for ~foo is /home/web/foo). But
it's possible to give . or .. as username. So if you try to access ~. you can 
see the listing of UserDir (in our example /home/web)  if there is no index.html
or equivalent. And if we use .. as username, so we try to access ~.. in server, 
we can see one directory up from UserDir (/home in our example). If we use 
~../.. as username, the handling seems to be correct. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Just set the UserDir to /tmp and watch your /tmp directory and / directory 
from browser. 
>Fix:
Probably check for username if UserDir is given as absolute path and if it is 
. or .. , deny access.

State-Changed-Why:
Grr.  You are correct.  While this problem hopefully doesn't
impact too many people too seriously (since most people don't
use that form of userdir, and even if they do on most systems
it would only let people get a listing of what they can get
anyway.

On some systems, however, it is more serious.

"UserDir DISABLED .." should work around the problem on
1.3 systems.
