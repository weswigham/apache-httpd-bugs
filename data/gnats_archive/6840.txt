>Description:
I discovered that some AVI files could not be sent back to our clients, while
any other type of file were okay.  I narrowed it down to the first 64 bytes,
reduce it by one and the problem goes away.. And by changing some random
characters, sometimes it would fix it, sometimes not.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://people.hbesoftware.com/~gozer/mod_mime_magic_error.avi is the file and a hex dump of it looks like:

$hexdump mod_mime_magic_error.avi
