"/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start
fopen: No such file or directory
httpd: could not open document config file /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started"

There is no conf dir, the conf files are in the etc dir.
When i copy the "etc" dir to "conf" dir i get: 
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd started

But there is no webserver running?

When is start it from Inetd the server seems up, but when i do a telnet 80 (or when i use a browser) i get:

"kill: 4298: no such process usage: /usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl (start|stop|restart|fullstatus|status|graceful|configtest|help) start - start httpd stop - stop httpd restart - restart httpd if running by sending a SIGHUP or start if not running fullstatus - dump a full status screen; requires lynx and mod_status enabled status - dump a short status screen; requires lynx and mod_status enabled graceful - do a graceful restart by sending a SIGUSR1 or start if not running configtest - do a configuration syntax test help - this screen"


help?


grtz,
