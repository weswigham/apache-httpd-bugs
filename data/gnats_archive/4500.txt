>Description:
I think I found something like a bug in 'embedded Perl'
in apache 1.3.4 that came with my suse 6.1 distribution:

When calling /cgi-bin/test.pl from Netscape about 10 times
I get an internal server error in 70% of the calls. The other
30% work fine. Apache or Perl do not find a subroutine.

The httpd.error_log message:

httpd: [Mon May 31 16:17:10 1999] [error] Undefined subroutine
&Apache::ROOT::cgi_2dbin::ihtmlctrl_2epl::OUTFILE called at
/usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/test.pl line 18.


After -disbling- the following lines in httpd.conf

  <Location /cgi-bin>
  AddHandler  perl-script .pl
  PerlHandler Apache::Registry
  PerlSendHeader On
  Options +ExecCGI
  </Location>

everything worked well.




/cgi-bin/test.pl:
-----------------

 #!/usr/bin/perl

 require "httpdio.pl";

 &OUTFILE("test.pl", 0, 0, 0);


httpdio.pl:
-----------

# Syntax: &OUTFILE( $Dateiname, $p1 ,$p2, $zeile)
#         bei $p1 = 0 wird kein "Content-type: text/html\n\n" ausgegeben, 
#         bei $p1 = 1 schon
#
#         bei $p2 = n wird an n ter Zeile $zeile ausgegeben.
#

sub OUTFILE {
my $z = 0;

if ( @_ > 0 ) {
  open( FILE, $_[0] );
    if ( $_[1] == 1 ) {
        print "Content-type: text/html\n\n" }

    if ( $_[2] > 0 ) {
      while(defined($i = <FILE>)) { 
        $z++;
        if ($z == $_[2]) {  
          print $_[3];
          print $i; 
        }
        else {
          print $i 
        }
      }
    }
    else {
      while(defined($i = <FILE>)) { 
        print $i 
      }
    }
  close(FILE);
}
}
