I'm using two servers, one Apache anf one Webstar. Either are capable
off autostarting mid files for bkgsound as in Netscape.
Please give me a hint, what to tell the webmasters. I've tried but only
getting the answer 'they don't dare because they are afraid of distur-
ing the other users. Yours truly

State-Changed-Why:
I don't think I understand your request.  Servers don't
start applications at the client end, the client does.
If a sound file is being played automatically, it's the
browser that's doing it, not the server.  The server is
just sending the file in response to the browser's request
for it.  What it is you're trying to tell the webmasters
(I assume you mean those running the servers)?

State-Changed-Why:
Please, if you are going to submit a report be sure your sentences make
sense.  This is not a channel for general user support; if you don't even
know what version is running, you really have to talk to the person
running the server.
 
I'm not sure what your problem is since you did not state any problem.  If
you are having trouble getting clients to handle MIDI files properly, try
adding:

        AddType audio/midi mid midi
 
to a file called .htaccess in the directory where the file is on the
server.  If that doesn't work, there are two million things that could be
wrong and you really have to talk to the administrator of your server.
