>Description:
Sorry if this is not the correct place to ask this kind of questions but actually I am testing Apache server versus another web servers like Netscape 4.1 and Internet Information Server 5.0. 

The problem I have is I have not found any document which explain the pros and cons of this three web servers. I mean Apache and Netscape on Unix and Apache and Internet Information Server on Windows NT/2000.

Could anybody tell me where could I found information about this questions.

Thanks in advance,

Joaquin Melero
