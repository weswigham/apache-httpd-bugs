State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug, it's a feature. Turning off fancy indexing
saves a stat() for each file in the directory, with the consequence
that directories cannot be distinguished from files. There
are other config directives which give finer control over
the appearance of directory listings so you should use those
rather than the big fancy indexing switch.
