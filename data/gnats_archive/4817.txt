 supporting DSOs is done by including mod_so in your build -- please check
 to see if it's present, with 'httpd -l'.  If not, you need to run
 configure with --enable-module=so before building Apache.
 
 If that's not the problem, please indicate so.  FYI, it is possible to
 build DSOs, at least with some configurations (this is more actively
 maintained than static compilation).

 HI,
 
 mod_so is included in apache, in fact as mentioned below, I did compile it with
 
 --enable-shared=most --enable-module=max that should actually include
 --enable-module=so. If I do a httpd -l only mod_core and mod_so are listed.
 
 so the Problem seems to be somewhere else. FYI this works all fine under 
 debian Linux and Sparc Solaris 2.6. Maybe it is a bug in the Solaris 2.7 
 Environment.
