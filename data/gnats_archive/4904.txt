The header I pass to -H is not found on the server side.

ab -v 2 -H 'MY_HEADER: HELLO_WORLD' http://myserver:myport/index.html

The "-v 2" will show the faulty blank line in the GET request.
>Fix:
file ab.c, line 778, replace
"\r\n" "%s"
by
"%s" "\r\n"

(This only concerns GET requests, POST requests seem to be OK)
