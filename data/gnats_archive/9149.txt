>Description:
I try to use the auto Listing Feature of a directory of 4000+/- files and after a while it just seems to stop trying to access the directory.

Here is my error log entry

[Sun Dec 16 15:17:18 2001] [error] [client 192.168.0.101] Directory index forbidden by rule: G:/music/, referer: http://zeus/side.htm

i tried it by typing it in http://zeus/music and http://zeus/music/

neither way helped.

Thanks

Jim
