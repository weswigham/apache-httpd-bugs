>Environment:
WinNT 4.0, Service Pack 6
>Description:
If I uncomment the following line in httpd.conf

LoadModule rewrite_module modules/ApacheModuleRewrite.dll

I get this error.

Syntax error on line 177 of d:/websites/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load d:/apache group/apache/modules/apachemodulerewrite.dll into server: (127) The specified procedure could not be found:

If I load the same httpd.conf file with Apache 1.3.12, it loads just fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
1/ Install 1.3.20 on Windows
2/ Uncomment the LoadModule rewrite_module line in httpd.conf.
3/ Start Apache.

This should repeat it.

State-Changed-Why:
Please see the htdocs/manual/mods/mod_so.html docs... after
apache 1.3.12 _all_ loadable apache modules for win32 were
changed to .so files, so ApacheModuleRewrite.dll is now
simply mod_rewrite.so - just like on unix.
