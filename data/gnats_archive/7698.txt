>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Solaris 8 (SPARC)- Patche level= 108528-03 - Compiler= gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 On SUN Ultra 1 system
>Description:
The error message which, appeared after I runned the " ./configure prefix=/usr/local/apache" was as follows:

# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bin
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.19
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Solaris 280 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed.  The below error output from the compilation
** test will give you an idea what is failing. Note that
** Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such as gcc. 

cd ..; gcc  -DSOLARIS2=280 -DUSE_EXPAT -I./lib/expat-lite -DNO_DL_NEEDED `./apaci`     -o helpers/dummy helpers/dummy.c   -lsocket -lnsl
gcc: installation problem, cannot exec `as': No such file or directory
make: *** [dummy] Error 1
======== Error Output for sanity check ========
============= End of Error Report =============

 Aborting!



>How-To-Repeat:
IF I try to compile dummy.c file alone: the following error message shows up:
"gcc: installation problem, cannot exec 'as' : No such file or directory
>Fix:
NO.
