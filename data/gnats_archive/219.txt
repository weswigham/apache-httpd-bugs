>Description:
1) The proxy seems to contact all the cached hosts even if these aren't
already expired. Is this a feature or a bug?
2) How can I set up my system to have more than one cache directory?
I tried creating symbolic links with directories (i.e. creating links instead
/usr/local/etc/httpd/proxy/A,B,C,D subdirectories ... pointing
to /proxy2/A,B,C,D real ones) but this doesn't work
3) The proxy seems very slow even on the LAN in which resides if compared with
non proxed connections

State-Changed-Why:
The proxy connects to hosts to see if newer data exists; if
not, it replies from cache. Proxies are slower than direct
connections.
