>Description:
Our Apache believes that there are much more requests are being processed
than there are real - i swear.
And - i believe - if the maximum of requests is reached, the server doesn't
send any documents. Netscape e.g. is waiting a document, but it is never
delivered. But the Apache-Processes are still there (seldom more than 5).
If I give Apache a SIGHUP signal, the server-status shows much less requests
being processed (seldom more than 5).
I've tried Apache 1.2b1, b7, b8 and b10, Kernel 2.0.30, 2.0.29, 2.0.27 and
there was always the same problem.

Here an example of Apache's server-status:

>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.
>Fix:
I made a workaround - a script running on the server checks 6 times a hour,
if apache lives, and, if not, it restarts it (SIGHUP)

State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sun Jun 22 22:11:43 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The main times I see this happen is when the server's internet pipe is
dropping a large number of packets.  The initial handshake finishes
but the server gets bogged responding.

Another possibility is that your system is swapping, i.e. you don't
have enough ram to handle your MaxClients setting.  You could
diagnose this by running "vmstat" while it's in this state.

And another possibility is broken CGIs, or broken 3rd party
modules.  I've seen both of these cause this.

In any event, I watch over several multimillion hit per day
linux boxes (running 2.0.30 + apache 1.2) and don't see this
problem.

Thanks for using Apache!
