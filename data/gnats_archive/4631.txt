>Description:
I run the 'perl Makefile.PL', which goes ok, but when I run 'make' I get fatal
errors that look like this:

===> modules/perl
gcc -I. -I../../include -I../../include/regex -I../../include/.././os/unix -DSOLARIS2=270 -DMOD_PERL   `/opt/depot/perl-5.004/bin/perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ccopts` -DNO_PERL_DISPATCH    -DNO_PERL_POST_READ_REQUEST -DNO_PERL_TRANS -DNO_PERL_HEADER_PARSER  -DNO_PERL_ACCESS -DNO_PERL_AUTHEN -DNO_PERL_AUTHZ  -DNO_PERL_TYPE -DNO_PERL_FIXUP -DNO_PERL_LOG  -DNO_PERL_INIT -DNO_PERL_CLEANUP -DNO_PERL_RESTART  -DNO_PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS -DNO_PERL_SECTIONS -DNO_PERL_METHOD_HANDLERS  -DNO_PERL_SSI -DNO_PERL_DIRECTIVE_HANDLERS   -DMOD_PERL_VERSION=\"1.20\"   -I./os/unix -I../../include    -c  mod_perl_opmask.c
sh: /opt/depot/perl-5.004/bin/perl: not found
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `mod_perl_opmask.o'
Current working directory /mnt/disk1/opt/depot/apache/src/modules/perl
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all'
Current working directory /mnt/disk1/opt/depot/apache/src/modules
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `subdirs'
Current working directory /mnt/disk1/opt/depot/apache/src
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `apache_httpd'

The line, "sh: /opt/depot/perl-5.004/bin/perl: not found" is the bug I believe
Although a copy of perl5004 is in that dir, the binary is called 'perl5'.
'perl' doesn't exist.  I don't have access to this dir, as it's NFS mounted
and I don't have root on the system, and thus I cannot create a symlink.
The weird thing is that I'm executing /opt/bin/perl, which it uses in other
parts of the make just fine.  Why is it switching what binary it wants to use?
Also, I have a complete 'perl Makefile.PL' log and 'make' log.  Email me, and
I will send them.  Thanks a million if you can help with this.
>How-To-Repeat:
i dunno
>Fix:
Make whatever is looking for this incorrect binary point to the binary
that I executed in the initial 'perl Makefile.PL'

State-Changed-Why:
The binary /bin/sh couldn't find, should be the one you ran perl Makefile.PL with.

What does 'grep PERL Makefile | head' give you?
