>Description:
when forking with apache 1.3.6, i experience some harsh problem with http header and content : 

if i write something to standard output before the C fork instruction, and, despite the fact i close stdout in my first child instruction line, i got a duplicate of header and bodies (I.e if i output onhting but the header text/plain, i'll get a plain text file (that's ok) but it will not be void. It will contain "Content-type: text/plain"....

and it is worse when i've done some previous output with an html page.

>How-To-Repeat:
/**************************************************/
this one will do duplicate header and body

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
  printf("Content-type: text/plain\n\n");  
  switch (fork())
    {
    case 0 :
      /* child */
      fclose(stdout);
      sleep(15);
      exit (0);      
      /* Parent : return to caller */
    default :
      break;
    }
  exit (0);
}

/**************************************************/
this one will perfectly work 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
  switch (fork())
    {
    case 0 :
      /* child */
      fclose(stdout);
      sleep(15);
      exit (0);      
      /* Parent : return to caller */
    default :
      break;
    }
  printf("Content-type: text/plain\n\n");  <----- moved after the fork process
  exit (0);
}
>Fix:
hum... don't know, bu i'd greatly appreciate any help (i will be in production status in short term and really don't want to switch to **** webserver)

State-Changed-Why:
Your code is buggy.  As the stdio man page on most platform
says, you need to ensure you flush certain types of buffers
before forking or the results are undefined.  eg. fflush(stdout)
