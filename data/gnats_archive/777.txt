>Description:
I called this `serious' because while it behaves usefully, it's not doing
what the docs say, and its functionality is reduced. (Don't webcrawlers
tend to update records which claim to be permanent deletions?)

In access.conf, for the whole server (not in a virtualhost directive):
RewriteEngine on
RewriteLog logs/rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 9
RewriteRule ^/w/(.*)$ http://www.mmm.co.uk/~warwick/$1 [R=permanent]

# /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd stop; /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start
...
# telnet stoat 80
Trying 194.200.167.3...
Connected to stoat.mmm.co.uk.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /w/ HTTP/1.0

Date: Tue, 24 Jun 1997 10:50:11 GMT
Server: Apache/1.2.0
