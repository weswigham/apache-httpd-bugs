>Description:
First, I do not know whether this is a confg problem or a bug!
I am using an hp system with 
kernel parameters
number of processes allowed 400
number of user process as 25

I am getting an error  
reason: couldn't spawn child process.

I do not have more than 8 users on the system, with 2 connections max. Also
total number of process (I did ps -ef | wc -l) is 146. I am running the apache
as user "nobody". 

Any help in this regard is appreciable.

State-Changed-Why:
First, 1.2b8 is no longer supported; we recommend you upgrade
to 1.2.

This is almost certainly due to a restriction in the number
of processes per user of your OS.  You may be able
to increase it with ulimit or limit, or you may have
to tune your kernel to do so.  Contact your vendor for
information on how this is done.
You could try creating a new user for Apache and having
it run as that user.
