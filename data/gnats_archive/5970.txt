>Description:
Apache 1.3.6 allows setting of UseCanonicalName in .htaccess file.
It is not working in 1.3.9 and 1.3.12.

error_log for >= 1.3.9:
[Sat Apr  8 04:36:39 2000] [alert] [client 10.5.1.7] /home/dodo/httpd/l_vp/.htaccess: UseCanonicalName not allowed here
>How-To-Repeat:
.htaccess with UseCanonicalName off
works with 1.3.6; doesn't work with 1.3.9
>Fix:
Just a question - should it works or not.
My web sites stopped working after an apache upgrade.
If I don't have root access to httpd.conf it
cannot be fixed.
Am I alone? :)

State-Changed-Why:

UseCanonicalName can be used if "AllowOverride Options"
has been set in the server configuration.
Previously it was "AllowOverride AuthConfig".
