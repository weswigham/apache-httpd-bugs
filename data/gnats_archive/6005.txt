httpd -l 
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c

  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_so.c
  mod_setenvif.c
  mod_ssl.c
suexec: enabled; valid wrapper /usr/local/apache/bin/suexec
i did not loaded any module there ist only one output
# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be startedt 
nothing else 
there  is no core dump at all
maybey the complaition of the static mod_ssl is the problem?
./configure \
"--with-layout=Apache" \
"--enable-module=ssl" \
"--enable-module=so" \
"--enable-suexec" \
"--suexec-docroot=/home/httpd" \
"--suexec-logfile=/var/log/httpd/suexec_log" \
"$@"
>How-To-Repeat:

i compiled it without mod_ssl
