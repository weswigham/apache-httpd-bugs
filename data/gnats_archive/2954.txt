In http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html, there's a link

Could you please be more specific?  Do you mean the link
in bullet item number 9?  I haven't been able to reproduce
this.

 Neither have I---today. I meant the link in item 9 and
 the button labelled "Search for/submit a problem report".
 Item 9 now links to http://bugs.apache.org/
 The button links to http://bugs.apache.org/?
 Both of these now give access to the Apache Problem Report Database.
 Maybe there was a temporary problem with the server; I experienced
 very long delays accessing bugs.apache.org and www.apache.org (of 
 course I use the mirrors whenever possible).
 
 Thanks for your attention; I'm sorry for wasting your time.
