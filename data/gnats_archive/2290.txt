Win NT 4.0, Pentium 120 single processor, 64meg memory.
>Description:
I was running 1.3b6;
I verified that everything was working on my website (www.pauahtun.org) and I
also backed up my .conf files.  I.e., I checked that my counters were working
and all my Python cgi scripts were working.  I then stopped the apache service,
installed 1.3b7, saw that my .conf files were not nuked.  I restarted apache
using the control panel.  I changed *nothing* else.  I tested the home page 
(Default.htm) and all four counters I use had the error string "Empty Query 
String" in them.  Then I tested my python scripts, which can be accessed at
www.pauahtun.org/tools.html, and all fail.  They all produce *only* the minimum
boilerplate that's common to all the scripts, and then fail silently.

There is *nothing* in the error log to indicate that anything is at all
wrong.

What's worse is that I then tried to revert to 1.3b6, but had deleted my 
install exe file, so I downloaded 1.3b6.1 from your dist/ directory,
and I still have the problem.  Counters don't work and cgi-scripts don't work.
Therefore, I  believe that something important changed between 1.3b6.0 
and 1.3b6.1.

I am also 100% certain that I changed nothing, installed nothing else, between the
time I stopped apache and installed 1.3b7, and am also 100% certain that
the things that are broken now were working seconds before I stopped apache
to perform the install.

I marked this critical because it's basically denying service to people visiting
my website and trying to use the tools that they've come to rely on.

No, I haven't looked at Apache source code in months!  No clue!  Help!

State-Changed-Why:
Is the "Empty Query String" something that your scripts
emit?  Can you try setting up a ScriptLog to see if there
are any messages recordable that way?  And setting LogLevel
to Debug?

 Empty QUERY_STRING! is inserted into the display area by count.exe; here
 is the href:

 I added ScriptLog logs/script.log to httpd.conf, then touched script.log
 & chmod a+w script.log, followed by a complete reboot.  Nothing is ever
 recorded in script.log.

 I added LogLevel debug to all three .conf files, and stopped/started
 apache.  No change whatsoever to what is logged in the access_log or
 error_log.  (BTW, these are actually listed as logs/tz_access_log and
 logs/tz_error_log in httpd.conf, under a VirtualHost section.)

 Is it possible to obtain a binary installation package for 1.3b6.0? 
 This is the version I was running, flawlessly, until 3pm or so 26 May
 1998, when I installed 1.3b7.
 
 Thanks,
 Ivan

[Note from submitter]
I read the 2294 bug report, and it does sound plausible.  However, it
does _not_ explain why, when I reverted to 1.3b6.1, I still get exactly
the same (non-)behaviour.

[Another comment from the submitter]
I *uninstalled* my existing apache server; this was originally 1.3b3,
then went to 1.3b6, then went to 1.3b7, which is the one that broke. 
All of these installations, except the first, were over existing ones. 
When I attempted to revert to 1.3b6, I just installed it over the 1.3b6,
and I had exactly the same problem.  However, when I *uninstalled*
apache using the add/remove programs wizard, and then removed the
complete /apache directory, and then reinstalled 1.3b6 everything worked
correctly again.  So you might want to include a warning to people to
uninstall any old versions before installing a new one--and I guess with
any MS OS you ought to do that anyway.

Thanks for all the speedy responses!
Ivan
