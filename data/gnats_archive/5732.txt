>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
SunOS hermite 5.6 Generic_105181-17 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5
gcc version 2.7.2.3.f.1
>Description:
After processing a URL containing "/index" as the first component, it is
possible to extend the path in any arbitrary way (i.e. "/index/balabala/yumyum").
Every time the server reports an "OK (200)" (which everytime is the top-level
index-file), which may mislead search-engines
like "htdig" to extend the path until the path gets too long to fit into the
variable-space (which can also cause a crash of the indexing search-engine).
>How-To-Repeat:
Correct URL's:
http://ls7-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/index

Incorrect URL's reported as OK [200]:
http://ls7-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/index/foo/
http://ls7-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/index/start/index/start

Correct URL:
http://www.apache.org/index

Incorrect URL but reported as OK:
http://www.apache.org/index/foo/
>Fix:
I am afraid, no!
