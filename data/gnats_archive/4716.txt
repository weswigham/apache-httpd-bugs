>Environment:
OpenVMS 7.1-1h2, DEC C 6.0 C compiler (ALPACRTL08), TCP/IP serv. for VMS 4.2ECO2
>Description:
In porting Apache to OpenVMS, limitations in the stat() function require
some files to be transferred using chunked transfer encoding rather than
via a content-length header.  When transferring files ap_bwrite gets called
with buffers larger than 4095 (0x0fff), which buff.c tries to convert to
a data chunk.  The bug is that CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE is only 5, for a 4 digit
hex number this causes the chunk header to overflow into data section and
gets the bytes counts out of sync.  The 1.1 client (e.g. IE5) hangs when
it tries to download this file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Remove the set_content_length call from default_handerl() function in 
http_core.c to force it to use chunked transfer mode.
>Fix:
Changing the value of CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE from 5 to 6 apparently fixes the
problem.  The real error may be that ap_bwrite() isn't breaking up the
buffer to write into smaller pieces for the chunk encapsulation - I don't
know enough about how the buffering is implemented.

State-Changed-Why:
hmm, i can't reproduce the problem with the method you gave --
i created a few files, one size 4096, one size 32768, i removed
set_content_length() from default_handler... and the chunked
responses were correct.

i've gone through this code a few times... it's possible there's
still a bug... if you can get me a working test case though
that'd be great.

Comment-Added:
user error.  DEFAULT_BUFSIZE was set to 8192 without changing
the CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE define as documented in buff.c.

yeah maybe there should be an assertion, however people playing
with constants in the code should read the comments...

 Th ap_config.h file I was using (inherited) set DEFAULT_BUFSIZE to 8192, so 
 the end_chunk code was seeing buffers larger than 4096.  Letting 
 DEFAULT_BUFSIZE be 4096 lets all the chunk headers fit in 5 bytes.  There is 
 a nice comment in buff.c explaining CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE's dependance on 
 DEFAULT_BUFSIZE, shouldn't there be an assertion to catch this misconfiguration
 at compile-time?
