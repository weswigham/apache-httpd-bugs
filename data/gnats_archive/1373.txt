>Description:
This problem is also in apache 1.3b2, but in mod_autoindex.

When autoIndexing is turned off and I have the lines:

ReadmeName footer
IndexIgnore footer *~

footer doesn't show up in the index.
>How-To-Repeat:
I can repeate but I don't have a server on the internet to show you,
sorry.
>Fix:
Change the documentation, and say that that ReadmeName only
works in Fancy Indexing.

Ok, i'd like to see it work in boring indexing too, and might hack it in
some time, but the doc change would be a good fix for now

This has been fixed; the ReadmeName file will now always
be displayed (as it should have been).  This change will
appear in the next release after 1.3b2.

Thanks for using Apache!
