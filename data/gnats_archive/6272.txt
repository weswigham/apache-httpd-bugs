Visual C++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
My computer does not have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and so 
I must resort to using the ServerName directive. However, even when I specify
ServerName in httpd.conf, Apache version 2.0a4 still fails on startup with a message: 
  Apache.exe: cannot determine local host name
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Apache on a machine that does not have a FQDN.
>Fix:
The configuration routines seem to expect a servername before they are
done walking the configuration tree, that is, before the server name has
been transfered from the configuration tree to the in-memory structures.
The main config file is loaded from apache_main by calling ap_read_config . 
Here is a traceback at the point where it's complaining about no "ServerName":
  ap_get_local_host(ap_pool_t * 0x00654130) line 1981
  ap_fini_vhost_config(ap_pool_t * 0x00654130, server_rec * 0x00654a38) line 487 + 9 bytes
  ap_read_config(process_rec * 0x0065211c, ap_pool_t * 0x006765b4, char * 0x00650160, ap_directive_t * * 0x0063dd84) line 1594 + 13 bytes
  apache_main(int 5, char * * 0x00650198) line 383 + 22 bytes
  main(int 3, char * * 0x00760bf0) line 468 + 16 bytes
The problem is that it isn't until ap_process_config is called later on that
the ServerName directive is processed. Consequently, the check in ap_fini_vhost_config
will always find that the server name has not been set, and set it to the default
hostname. This works as long as a FQDN is available but causes an unavoidable
start failure otherwise.
It seems that the call to ap_fini_vhost_config has to be deferred, but I don't
know enough about the process to suggest where it should go.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem should have been solved in later versions of
Apache 2.0.  Could you please try the latest alpha, 2.0a6
and let us know if this is still happening.

Thank you for using Apache
