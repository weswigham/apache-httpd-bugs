windows 2000
>Description:
Just sevral days ago, I downloaded the windows version of the apache server. 
But when I tried to install it on windows 2000,I found it did not work! 
In fact,when installing apache as a service on win2000,I got a error message 
saying that the (server) process had stopped exceptionally. 
I wonder if there is a version of the server for windows 2000? Or just for win9x /NT?? 
If there is for win2000,how to explain the accident?? 
Waiting for your answer! 
Thanx!
