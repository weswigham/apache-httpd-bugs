>Description:
When i'm trying to send a Vector containing one String to an applet, using the serialization mechanisme, i get the following error in the jserv log file and the applet cannot build the object.
But when i try to send an empty Vector, it works fine.
Here is a sample from my logfile.
[03/07/2000 18:12:53:438 GMT+02:00] java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.util.Vector: method add(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z not found
