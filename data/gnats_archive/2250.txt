I have no reason to think it will make any difference, but
could you try with the recently released 1.3.0 version?  In
the meantime I'm looking into this.

 I've got 1.3b7
 
 suexec.c asks for 'conf.h' (1.3b6 didn't), and it doesn't seem to be
 around, so I can't compile it
 to do what you ask
 
 Any suggestions?

Comment-Added:
How are you compiling suexec?  You should be doing

  cd src/support
  make suexec

conf.h is in src/include/conf.h.  You should be seeing a
compilation line similar to this:

  cc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include  -O2 suexec.c

with possibly a few other options.  If you're not, then
something's not right.

Are you using the FreeBSD port of Apache, or did you
download the tarball directly from the Apache site?
I recommend strongly that you do the latter and pick
up 1.3.0; there is at least one known problem with the
FreeBSD port..

 Started all over with Apache_1.3.0: suexec problem: 'too few arguments'
 seems to
 have gone away
