>Description:
I am getting the following error upon startup when I try to add
a <Files> directive to my HTTPD.CONF under 1.3.1 Apache for Win32

[Thu Aug 27 10:11:14 1998] file .\os\win32\util_win32.c, line 66, assertion "s >
= szFile && "this is a known bug"" failed
>How-To-Repeat:
Add anything that is a files directive to httpd.conf

eg I first tried this with mod_perl for Win32:

<Files *.perl>
   SetHandler perl-script
   PerlHandler Apache::Registry
   PerlSendHeader On
   Options +ExecCGI
</Files>

This is not just a mod_perl issue though-- it also does not work when 
I disable mod_perl and try other <Files *.perl> directives.

 Correct, as the error says it is a known bug.

 OK, I ended up working around it by using Apache 1.3's new FilesMatch
 directive...
 
 So I did
 
 <FilesMatch "\.pl$">
 
 instead of
 
 <Files *.pl>
 
 And that seems to work great.  
 
 Anyway, thanks a lot for responding so quickly with an answer.
 
 Later,
     Gunther

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: kparz@raleigh.ibm.com
State-Changed-When: Mon Nov  9 05:32:08 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The Files directive was definitely having some problems
because of some problems with the processing in 
os_canonical_filename.  os_canonical_filename has been
rewritten to solve some of this problems, and the
Files directive should be fixed now.  The fix
is in CVS and should be reflected in the next release.

Thanks for using Apache.
