SunOS dor-ent1 5.5.1 Generic_103640-22 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise
>Description:
Assume Apache runs under Solaris on 'mylocalhost' with userid 'webserver' (the
user that invokes Apache server). There is a remote host called 'myremotehost' 
on which there is an account 'myuid', whose password on 'myremotehost' is 
'mypwd'. Then under Solaris, if user 'webserver' has a file called '.netrc' in
its home directory, '/home/webserver', with the following contents:

machine myremotehost login myuid password mypwd

user 'webserver' should be able to run ftp and login NON-INTERACTIVELY to
'myremotehost' as user 'myuid'. If I submit a form using Netscape 4.x that
executes a cgi script (written in Bourne shell script) that contains the ftp 
command, the script executes, but the ftp login fails. Error message from 
'myremotehost' when I stop the submission is:

Name(myremotehost: webserver) password missing from PASS 

"Name" and "PASS" are actually ftp commands and part of the INTERACTIVE ftp 
dialog that 'myremotehost' would generate if there were no '.netrc' file in
'/home/webserver' on 'mylocalhost'. (To test the script, if I run the same cgi 
script by logging into 'mylocalhost' as user 'webserver' and execute the script 
directly, instead of invoking the script from Netscape, I am now able to login 
to 'myremotehost' non-interactively and ftp files between 'mylocalhost' and
'myremotehost'.)
>How-To-Repeat:
You should be able to repeat this problem by running Netscape 4.x on a client
workstation and creating an HTML form that invokes a cgi script that contains
the ftp command, where the home directory of the Apache user 
(e.g., /home/webserver) contains the .netrc file described above.
>Fix:
Have you disabled this capability for security reasons? If so, it should be a
user selectable Apache configuration option.

[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the

Thanks for using Apache!
