>Description:
The bug is fully described in #1978 which was submitted in Feb 1999.  The code
which checks the require lines in mod_auth_dbm.c (dbm_check_auth()) has not
changed in your most recent alpha (httpd-2_0_18-alpha), so the problem still
remains.   The problem is that the requirement checking in mod_auth_dbm.c is
NOT CONSISTENT with the requirement checking in mod_auth.c. In particular,
mod_auth_dbm.c checks only 1 "require group" directive if any "require group"
directive is given in the .htaccess file.  If a "require group" directive exists,
it does not check any "require user" directive.  It returns AUTH_REQUIRED (with
the default value of AuthDBMAuthoritative on) if the user does not happen to
be in a group given on that single directive line without continuing to test
for another require directive.  See the article
http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth
in the section "Using Groups" which explains that multiple require directives
may be used, both directives for user and group with have an "OR"'d effect.
mod_auth_dbm.c does not conform to this method of checking require directives
because it exits from the loop reading the require directives by returning
AUTH_REQUIRED (HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED) or DECLINED when checking a "require group" directive.
>How-To-Repeat:
With a dbm file with both users and groups:
	.	put userx into groupx
	.	leave usery outside any group
	.	put userz into groupz

On a directory with an html page in it, add an .htaccess file referencing the
dbm file for user and groups.  Add the require directives:
	require user usery
	require group groupx
	require group groupz
Neither usery nor userz will be able to access the page.
>Fix:
The loop in the dbm_check_auth() should conform to the coding method used
in mod_auth.c (check_user_access()) where the code returns an OK if the
user is found in a named group or on a require user statement.  The code should
wait until the end of the loop when NO criterion has been satisfied in order
to send AUTH_REQUIRED (HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED in the newer code) or DECLINED 
depending on the setting of AuthDBMAuthoritative directive.
