>Description:
My young son accidentally found an "adult" site on the internet a few days ago.
I was interested in finding a good surfwatch type program for unix that I could
use to block offensive sites.  I couldn't find anything for unix, so I modified
the proxy module to add a new config option "ContentBlock" which, when configured
with a regular expression, will check the content of all text/http buffers
before passing them to the proxy client.  If they match the regexp then the
proxy session halts the transfer.  As most adult sites have a long list of 
"content" on the first page - they want the search engines to index them - 
a relatively trivial regexp seems to stop most of the content that is not
appropriate for children.  The mod was quite simple and I tried to follow
the apache coding style - used pools and the pool-based regexp utils.  I realize
some might be offended that I am filtering content and cry "censorship" but it
is configurable.  If you want the module modifications I can provide them.
It is a total of about 20 lines of code.

State-Changed-Why:
This was forwarded to the developers' list and received
little comment.  If you want to contribute a patch I could
put it in our "contributed patches" directory, which is an
unsupported area.  Or you could register it at modules.apache.org
if you'd rather.
