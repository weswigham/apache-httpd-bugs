When accessing a mod_perl document the child segfaults under Apache/1.3.6+mod_php-3.0.7

backtrace results:

*(gdb) run -X -f /s101/current/config/apache/launch/ben-httpd.conf
Starting program: /a/apache_1.3.6/src/./httpd -X -f /s101/current/config/apache/launch/ben-httpd.conf

>How-To-Repeat:
Problem is only apparent with mod_perl and mod_php, and seems to only occur on
rhlinux 5.1 systems.

State-Changed-Why:
Could you please try this again with the latest mod_perl and mod_php? I vaguely remember having heard about something similar with the version of mod_php you were using.

Please also remember to compile with DEBUG stuff enabled.
