 Hmm, given that this is not seen on identical hardware/OS combinations
 under serious load there migh be more. Just to cut down the playground 
 to a managable size:
 
 0.	Is it a specific page or URL which it always hangs on ?
 1.	What sun patches did you (already) apply
 2.	What mdoules have you compiled in ?
 3.	If you do 'truss -p XXX' or 'gdb -p XXX' on
 	the offending process what is it doing ?
 4.	Are any of your (log) files on NFS ?
 5.	Are you using (nis(+))
 6.	What other services are you running on that
 	machine ? Do they have the same issue.
 
 From your msg it is unclear wether or not you are looking
 for commercial support. The web page will give you a list
 of companies happily doing this.

 I neglected to mention that I'm also using PHP.  After spending some
 serious time looking through their bug database and mailing lists, I am
 beginning to suspect this is the culprit.  There are plenty of reports of
 various memory leaks, etc. in the database.  In the meantime, I have
 installed 1.3.12 w/ a new version of PHP to see what happens.

 Yeah...that's what I was thinking about...I will check out the page.
