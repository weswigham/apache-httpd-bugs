>Environment:
Linux, Caldera or Red Hat recent install .  Don't know if 
this should be  actually in general or mod_proxy . 
>Description:
Error log messages should list host name when no route to host is
found or connection refused.  
Example...
[Thu Apr 10 10:08:00 1997] connect: No route to host
[Thu Apr 10 10:09:31 1997] connect: Connection refused

On first line, instead of "host" should have hostname or IP address.   
on second line, Connection refused should say who refused it.

Thanks,
John
>How-To-Repeat:
Try going to an invalid host name or one that returns a security error
>Fix:
I believe the host name is there, just print it in the error message
