>Release:        1.3b7
>Environment:
Win95
>Description:
The SSI statment EXEC statement will not execute shell commands.  For example "<!--#EXEC CMD="DIR" -->" does not execute the DIR command.
>How-To-Repeat:
Include the SSI EXEC CMD= in any shtml page.
>Fix:
1) In module util_script.c the WIN32 portion of ap_exec_cmd() uses r->file_name to locate the executable file instead of argv0.
2) In module util_script.c the WIN32 code uses the value "CMD.EXE" to specify the command interpreter instead of the constant SHELL_PATH.
3) In header httpd.h the SHELL_PATH constant must be set to "COMMAND.COM" for WIN95.

WinNT.
