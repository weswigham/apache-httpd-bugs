>Environment:
NT 4.0sp4 & Apache 131 (out of the box binary from apache.org)
>Description:
I use Apache together with Coldfusion 4.0 (module) from Allaire as an application server
and get these in the error.log;

[Fri Nov 20 01:55:19 1998] file .\os\win32\util_win32.c, line 81, assertion "ap_isalpha(szCanon[0])" failed

This causes the Apache to freeze with a number of Dialog Boxes 
(Friggin NT that can't just allow processes to die silently)
aprrox. six - ten times a day depending on traffic load.

State-Changed-When: Fri Nov 20 05:06:22 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The routine that you are having the problem with has
been rewritten to solve a handful of different problems.
This problem should also be solved by the rewrite.  The
fix is currently integrated into the CVS code tree, and
should be available in the next release of Apache for
windows.

Thanks for using Apache!!!
