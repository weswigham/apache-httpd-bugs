>Description:
I've setup Apache 1.3.9 to cache and forward all http/ftp requests to my
firewall.  When I download a *.exe file via the apache server the files
fail to execute because there is a CR inserted by the apache server. 
This doesn't happen at all sites but when I use use my firewall directly
as a proxy I don't have this problem.
