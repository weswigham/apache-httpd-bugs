>Organization:
>Environment:
Moving from Windows NT 4 SP3 to Windows NT 4 SP6
>Description:
I am using Apache 1.3.9 on Window NT 4.0.  It worked perfectly while the NT OS was at Service Pack 3.  However, I recently upgraded to Service Pack 6.  Now every connection to the server causes a line in the Apache Error log:
[Sat Nov 06 14:50:33 1999] [warn] setsockopt: (TCP_NODELAY)   This can very quickly lead to a LOT of lines in the error log, with potentials for disk full etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Upgrade a version of NT4 using Service Pack 6
>Fix:
If it is only a warning, remove the warning message?
