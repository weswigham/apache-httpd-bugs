FreeBSD 3.3 With GCC-2.95.1
>Description:
When compiling apache with --prefix=/usr/local/www/server --enable-module=proxy --enable-rule=socks4 --enable-rule=socks5 options I get a compile error

** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 installed latest gcc compiler with same result. I also removed socks support and it worked fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install FreeBsd 3.3-release and instal apache thats all I have on my system
>Fix:
not compiling socks support
