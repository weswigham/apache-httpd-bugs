Windows NT4 Server

>Description:
I have installed Apache as an service.
But when I try to start it with either "NET START APACHE"
or from the service manager it gives the following error,
In consol window
  C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache>net start apache
  System error 193 has occurred.
  *** is not a valid Windows NT application.
  C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache>
Event log(NT)says
The Apache service failed to start due to the following error: 
%1 is not a valid Windows NT application.

I can run and signal it as normal when I run as an application
from a consol window. Like this:
C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache>apache
Apache/1.3.4 (Win32) running...

In the registry I have:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Apache\ImagePath=
"C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\Apache.exe"

If I make a search for the imagepath it finds the Apache.exe

Have tried to install (default location) and uninstall it servral times, no change.

Jakob,

With regards your PR3842 problem.

I had exactly the same probem and was able to fix by changing the Apache
entry in the registry. For some reason the service control manager does not
want to take long file names, and just using the older style DOS 8.3 format
seemed to fix my problems.
