>Description:
When I load the URL (on an Intranet) http://toto/mésange/index.htm

the server answers : "Error 404 : Cannot find the file http://toto/m" !! The file and directory exist but it seems that Apache cut the URL if there is an e accute in it. (This works well using Frontpage personnal server).

This is absolutly non critical as I have renamed my directory.

Regards
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, it is Intranet
>Fix:
Check the URL interpreter.
