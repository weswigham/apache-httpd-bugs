>Environment:
BSDI 3.0 with gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
We had apache 1.1.3 with 371 virtual domains configured.  When we upgraded to
apache 1.2, the server could not deliver WWW pages.  A browser displays
"Document contains no data".  The syslog file contains mentions of SIGSEV but
the core file is for the parent process and contains nothing of interest.  Other interesting behavior:  Here is a typical
definition of a virtual domain:

<VirtualHost www.performanceds.com>
ServerName www.performanceds.com
ServerAdmin webmaster@cruzio.com
DocumentRoot /cruzio/web/pages/cruzio/nopage
TransferLog logs/domains/xfer/www.performanceds.com
ErrorLog logs/domains/error/www.performanceds.com
</VirtualHost>

If I comment out either the TransferLog or the ErrorLog line then the server
works, but if I enable both then the server fails.  I have confirmed that this
is NOT a problem of running out of file descriptors.  Again, we do not have
a problem with the 1.1.3 server, but why?
>How-To-Repeat:
Our httpd.conf has 371 virtual domains.  The virtual host definition that breaks
the server is shown above.

Nope

State-Changed-Why:
Yes it is almost certainly a problem with file descriptors.
1.2 allocates them in a different order than 1.1 due
to some changes.  Assuming you adjusted the number of
file descriptors reported by ulimit, you are probably
running into FD_SETSIZE, (probably in /usr/include/sys/)
which limits the number of file descriptors select() can
use.  I'm not sure how you increase that under BSDI 3.0;
perhaps redefining it to something larger in EXTRA_CFLAGS
in Configuration will work.  If not, you may have to
rebuild your kernel with a different option.  Ask BSDI
or a BSDI newsgroup/list for help.
