>Description:
When you try to bring up the httpd with httpd -f <httpd.conf> file, it complains
that the Syntax at line 33 of access.conf is incorrect.

the line in question is

order deny,allow
allow from all
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I commented it out right now and was able to bring up the server, but server
does not allow for 'GET', thereby denying access to htdocs for anyone
