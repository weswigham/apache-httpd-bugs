>Description:
There is a team on a www-project who are on the same
group (GID). Directory has "Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch" enabled.
The problem arises if there is a symlink to a file and other
person edits the file (to which the symlink points to) than the
owner of the symlink. After this the server refuses to handout
the document because the ownerships has been chnaged and they
do not match anymore.
>How-To-Repeat:
No demo needed, i hope...
>Fix:
Yes, offer a new argument to Options called SymLinksIfGroupMatch
or something like that. With this option enabled the group ownerships
are compared. OF course this doesn't override any file protections,
the team must take care of those 8-%2

State-Changed-Why:
It's too late to get this into 1.2, but I'll see that it
definitely gets considered for a future release.  Thank
you for the idea and for using Apache!

Comment-Added:
I actually implemented this for apache 1.3, you can find a patch
for it at http://www.arctic.org/~dgaudet/patches/apache-1.3-symlinksifgroupmatch.patch
... but there was a general feeling in the group that it wasn't
a feature that folks wanted.

A shame, it's absolutely necessary for working on systems with
group maintained directories.
