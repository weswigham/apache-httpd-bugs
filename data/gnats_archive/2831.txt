Solaris 26
>Description:
When I downloaded the binaries from the Apache site for 1.3.1, it downloaded
onto a WRONG file that ends with _tar.tar, but actually it is supposed to be
.tar.gz.

Thus, when you download this file, you may want to double-check the file name
and see that it ends with gz.

The filename is fine, it is your browser that is broken.
IE and Navigator have various bugs relating to this that
make them needlessly and foolishly mangle filenames.

 Hi Marc,
 
 Thanks for the feedback. I didn't know about this problem with the browsers.
