/usr/src/apache/src/include/ap_config.h:76: ap_config_auto.h: No such file or directory

file says:
#ifndef WIN32
#include "ap_config_auto.h"
#else

change log says:

 *) Global renaming of C header files to both get rid of conflicts with third
     party packages and to again reach consistency:
       1. conf.h      -> ap_config.h
       2. conf_auto.h -> ap_config_auto.h \ these are now merged
       3. ap_config.h -> ap_config_auto.h / in the config process
       4. compat.h    -> ap_compat.h
       5. apctype.h   -> ap_ctype.h
     Backward compatibility files for conf.h and compat.h were created.


ap_config_auto.h is a leftover???

Sorry I'm such a dummy, I don't know which header should go in it's place.

Huh?  Why do you say ap_config_auto.h doesn't belong there?
It most certainly does.  The message you quote from the CHANGES
file says that conf_auto.h was renamed TO ap_config_auto.h.

Please show the exact output from the last dozen lines or so
of a failed compile.  Also please give exact details on
what OS you are using, since this could well be a bug with
your OS.

 The impression I got from the changes directory was that ap_config_auto.h
 was consolidated into other header files. Anyway, there is no such 
 file in my include directory, observe:
 
 eagle:/usr/src/apache/src/include# ls a*
 alloc.h      ap_compat.h  ap_ctype.h   ap_mmn.h
 ap.h         ap_config.h  ap_md5.h

 Don't think it's a bug. Apache compiles fine and works ok on the 
 system. I'm trying to compile mod_javascript which uses these include 
 files.
 
 I just downloaded it from:
 
 http://js.apache.org/archive/
 BTW, the link in the apache modules registry needs to change

 No, it is generated when you configure Apache.  You need to configure
 Apache first, at which piont the ap_config_auto.h file is created.

 Woah!  That is something you should have mentioned from the start.  
 
 Does Apache without mod_javascript compile fine?  That is always the first
 thing to try.

 No, you don't have to compile it just configure it by running Configure or
 configure, depending on which you use.

Try it from a fresh distribution and run configure first.
