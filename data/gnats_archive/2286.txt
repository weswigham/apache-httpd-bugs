>Description:
An oversite in the mime.types file that comes with Apache makes all Macromedia
ShockWave Flash animations (application/x-shockwave-flash) come across as
text/plain (or whatever your default MIME type is).  As a result, most browsers
fail to load the appropriate plug-in to handle it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any default installation will pass swf files as text/plain
>Fix:
Add

application/x-shockwave-flash swf

to the mime.types file in the distribution.

State-Changed-Why:
Note that the IMT is "application/x-shockwave-flash".  The
"x-" prefix indicates that the type isn't registered yet.
We'll consider updating the mime.types file, but in the
meantime the correct workaround is to add a line to your
server config files:

 AddType application/x-shockwave-flash .swf

Thanks for using Apache!  I've marked this report for
future consideration.
