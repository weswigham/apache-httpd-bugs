Hi!

do not get terminated when the httpd is shut down.
>How-To-Repeat:
should show up with any FCGI app

nope, sorr

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 24 16:17:40 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
mod_fcgi is no longer going to be bundled with Apache 
because it is maintained by an outside organization.
