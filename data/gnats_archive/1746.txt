lines like this: 

ServerType standalone           # run as daemon

don't work with apache. IMHO a bug, as this does not permit me to construct
terse and short configfiles.

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 30 11:00:46 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This isn't supported by Apache.  There's another PR in the
database as well on it, and it's mentioned in the NCSA compatibility
page.

It's not supported because there is no method of escaping a #
for use in commands with RAW_ARGS... amongst other things.
Proper support for this would require a lot of surgery on
the parser.
