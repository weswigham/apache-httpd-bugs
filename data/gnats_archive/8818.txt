Shows this in the error_log file:

[Tue Nov 20 15:25:37 2001] [info] created shared memory segment #163841         

Recompiled everything twice and updated everything.

 Update:
 
 I have tried compiling apache with no options (just a base path) and it
 still dies, so it is not a module problem.

 Currently:
 I added tags all over the http_main.c file, here is what I found:
 
 it runs setup_shared_mem(p) fine. but dies somewhere between the end of
 setup_shared_mem and the next line of the calling statement.
 
 
 Read more indepth the Debugging guide and ran a gdb (V4.18) :
 
 Single stepping until exit from function setup_shared_mem,
 which has no line number information.
 Cannot insert breakpoint 0:
 Cannot access memory at address 0x53a9.
 
 if I 'c' (continue):
 
 Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
 0x0 in ?? ()
 
 --------------
 
 
 Added more Log messages showing @ all MMAP calls in setup_shared_mem:
 
 NONE was being called.

 FIX:
 
 Wasn't using MMAP scoreboard but SHMGET. Changed to MMAP. Got error
 referanced by:

 Fixed using recomended method in message.
