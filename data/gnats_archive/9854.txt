I am not exactly sure what caused the problem, but during the 'make install', in the section of code below, both $root and $manualdir became null, so a lot of files were installed to // (i.e., /). Also, the installer began chmod'ing EVERYTHING on the system to 755, which was extremely undesirable.

             echo "Copying tree $(TOP)/htdocs/manual -> $(root)/$(manualdir)/"; \
             (cd $(TOP)/htdocs/manual/ && $(TAR) $(TAROPT) - *) |\
             (cd $(root)$(manualdir)/ && $(TAR) -xf -); \
             find $(root)$(manualdir)/ -type d -exec chmod a+rx {} \; ; \
             find $(root)$(manualdir)/ -type f -print | xargs chmod a+r ; \
     fi
>How-To-Repeat:
I do not know how to repeat the problem, since the second install (performed very cautiously after doing a make -n) went fine.
>Fix:
I would STRONGLY suggest checking for the condition where $root and $manualdir are both "" and aborting the install, since the user is NEVER going to want all their directories and files chmod'ed to 755. I don't know how it even happened, but it did, and the resulting mess was extremely difficult to clean up.
