>Description:
Currently ProxyRemote does not allow wildmatches (or regexpr) to identify
the URL portion to be proxied.

This is very usefull, when having long similar proxy lists like:
    ProxyRemote   http://www.ex1.server.de/     http://xxxxx
    ProxyRemote   http://www.ex2.server.de/     http://xxxxx
    ProxyRemote   http://www.si.server.de/      http://xxxxx
    etc.

Feature request:
    ProxyRemoteMatch    regexpr                 up-proxy

e.g.:
    ProxyRemoteMatch    http://www\..*\.server\.de/   http://xxxxx

similar behavior like  "Redirect" and  "RedirectMatch"

Also IMO usefull:
    NoProxyMatch        regexpr


Tnx for listening - Rainer
