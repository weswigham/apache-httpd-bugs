>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux (RedHat 6.2 workstation install) x86, using Apache 1.3.14 sources from the apache foundation.

uname -a reports: Linux test 2.2.14-5.0 #1 Tue Mar 7 21:07:39 EST 2000 i686 unknown

egcs: egcs-1.1.2-30
>Description:
while installing mod_ssl 2.7.1 to the apache 1.3.14 source tree, i was not getting a comepleted configuration. no src/ Makefiles were built. this was with libsafe-1.3-4 installed (from RPM, obtained from  http://www.bell-labs.com/org/11356/libsafe.html). the problem was i had installed OpenSSL 0.9.6 from RPMs, which places the libraries in /usr/lib, headers in /usr/include and apps in /usr/bin, but the default (and what mod_ssl expects) is in /usr/local/ssl. as such, it could not find my ssl libraries and headers, so it could not comeplete installation.

unsetting the LD_PRELOAD option, which libsafe uses, caused these error messages to be generated, revealing the problem. i am unable to acertain why libsafe supressed the error output. 
>How-To-Repeat:
install libsafe from RPM, set LD_PRELOAD (LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libsafe.so.1; export LD_PRELOAD), and now attempt to apply mod_ssl to the apache sources with the wrong OpenSSL installation location. no errors should be generated, and no Makefiles in src should be generated, as well.
>Fix:
when configuring apache, unset LD_PRELOAD. no permanent workaround has been discovered by me.

State-Changed-Why:

This appears to be a problem with mod_ssl and/or another
library.  Please contact the distributors of those
programs to report your problems.  There is nothing
we can do about code that we do not maintain.
Thanks for using Apache!
