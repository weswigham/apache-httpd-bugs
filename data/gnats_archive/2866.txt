The port to this system is mine. Once finished, it will be the object of a submission.
>Description:
The synopsis tells what the problem is. The config.status script generated by configure passes extra arguments to configure using $*. However, "$@" should be used instead, as in any script wanting to pass its arguments unchanged to another program (see sh(1) for more info if needed).
>How-To-Repeat:
An example would be:

% ./configure --prefix /tmp
% ./config.status proxycachedir="/this --isstupid but shows the problem"

and configure will complain about the --isstupid argument.
>Fix:
The following trivial patch fixes the problem:
