Upgraded from 1.2.4 to 1.3.0 and everythings great but the ssi
functions...I Checked the logs It says warn handler "server-parsed" not found
using default handler instead...
I have the addhandler server-parsed .shtml
and the options to indexes FollowSymlinks +Includes
just the same as my older apache config and it works ...
i recompiled and it did no change..I did check the Configuration 
file.

I went to the specified page and the counter appeared to
be working, so I'm assuming you found and fixed your
problem.  Thanks for using Apache!
