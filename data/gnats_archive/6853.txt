 Dear sir,=20
    I'm trying execute my servlet in Apache webserver 1.3.14 (using =
 Apache JServ 1.2). My servlet accesses Oracle 8i database using Orcale =
 JDBC-ODBC bridge.=20
 When I call my servlet from my browser, it is saying oci.dll missing and =
 hence couldn't make connection to the database.=20
 Actually, a standalone program running under JVM (with the same database =
 access code) is able to make connection. Also that I could execute my =
 servlets using other webservers such as Java webserver and Tomcat =
 webserver without any problem and without modifying any configuration =
 settings. =20
 I feel that the problem is with Apace webserver and JServ combination =
 that is giving trouble because I could run my servlets using other =
 webservers.
 
  I search from the website and find other people have the same problem, =
 but I don't get the answer!
 Please help me.=20
