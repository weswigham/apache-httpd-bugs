>Description:
If these are not set in the config file, the defaults work.  They take on 
bad values if set.

Basically, the serverroot path is prepended to these names.  Since these are
YP map names, and not files, this makes no sense.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install optional module mod_auth_yp.c and attempt to set any of AuthYPDomain, 
AuthYPUserTable, or AuthYPGroupTable in httpd.conf.
>Fix:
In mod_auth_yp.c, in function set_auth_yp_slot, change 

return ap_set_file_slot(cmd, offset, f);

to:

*(char **) ((char *)offset + ((int) (long) cmd->info) ) = f;
return NULL;
