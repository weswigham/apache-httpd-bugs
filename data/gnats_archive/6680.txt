From what I can gather, it may be related to an invalid URI request.

First the logs:
(Note that the images listed (images/bb*.gif) are being called from the root..thus ../ is entirely unneeded since you're not in a subdir..but I am not sure if that is causing the problem as apache should be able to catch that)

Next the core dump:
rw-------   1 apache   system   29564928 Oct 14 01:13 core

And the analysis--notice the last thing out is a customized 400 error, which translates to "bad uri request"

The particular site in question is www.blomand.net. Interestingly enough, if I try to go to one of those URLs I don't get a customized error page..I instead get an IE error telling me it can't find the server.

 Yeah just to let you know I am getting ready to submit a patch with about 
 10 bug fixes/improvements for 1.3.14 dealing with Tru64/OSF but I had this 
 one last 1.3.x bug I couldn't figure out.  I'd like to duplicate those to 
 2.0 as well to make sure Tru64 support is up to speed, but I couldn't get 
 it to compile.  So that's why I am submitting both 1.3.x and 2.0 bugs :)

 Oh one more thing...this came from a Compaq engineer who saw my core dump
 --
 
 From a crude 1st pass through "modules/standard/mod_include.c", I wonder ...
 
 Hmmmmm ... why is get_tag() returning an invalid pointer which causes
 strcmp() to segmentation fault ?
