>Description:
The mod_jserv.so installed by the "make install" is a copy of the libjserv.a file, and won't work.

Here's what it says:

Copying files to Apache Modules Directory...
/usr/bin/cp ./.libs/libjserv.a /opt/apache/libexec/mod_jserv.so


This is what it SHOULD do:
ld -B dynamic -G -z allextract -o /opt/apache/libexec/mod_jserv.so libjserv.a

just try and built the damn thing :-)
>Fix:
This is what it SHOULD do to convert the .a to a .so

ld -B dynamic -G -z allextract -o /opt/apache/libexec/mod_jserv.so libjserv.a
