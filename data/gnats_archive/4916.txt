For exsample:
In config I have:
<DIRECTORY />
DefaultLanguage ru
</DIRECTORY>

I this directory I have files:
a.html
a.html.en

where a.html in Russian and a.html.en in English

Now I have request for document /a.html from web browser who have setted HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE=en
Apache returns /a.html, not /a.html.en
Thats wrong. I think, if I have setted DefaultLanguage for DIRECTORY thats mean a.html == a.html.ru
But if browser asks for /a - Apache returns correct document - /a.html.en

 This is not a big, but a config isse.
 
 What is happening is that the exact match takes precendece. Just configure
 as
 
 	a.html.ru
 	a.html.en
 
 And then either
 	DefaultLanguage 	ru en
 	DefaultLanguage 	en ru
 
 which will rule when a.html is requested with no ACCEPT languyage set.

We don't negotiate on exact matches because to do so would
be a performance nightmare.  The suggested solution is right.

  It is not possible for me. Our web site havee about 300 russian pages 
 and only 20..30 english pages. I can't rename old index.html files.

 I am afraid you will have to either resort to very clever mod_rewrite
 tricks; or do an automatic 'find docroot -name '*.html' -exec mv {} {}.ru
 \;' sort of trick. Or hack mod_negotiation.c. Note that you do not (nor
 should!) change any of the links! Just the name of the files!
 
 But are no longer discussing a bug in apache. So IMHO this bug report is
 to be closed. Ok ?
