Apache 1.3.4 + Frontpage ext.4.0 + Mod_SSL-2.1.8-1.3.4 + php-3.0.12
>Description:
For some reason Iexplorer5.0 wants to open doc files without giving you the option of saving it to disk. It then tells you that the server requires a password and user-name. However when you click on the cancel button it opens the files anyway in an embedded word-window.


My previous Apache server (Apache1.3.0+FP extensions) did not do this and I did try to use the newest version of Apache(1.3.9) but I couldn’t get one or more of  the patches (FP,PHP,Mod_SSL) to work.
The error_log file does not log this action either.
