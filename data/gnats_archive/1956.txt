 That is the way that VC generates them, and unless you have a good reason
 we aren't going to go messing with what it generates.

 (don't have Windows around right now to look)
 
 Does this actually cause you a problem and stop it from compiling?

 That obviously works for us, so you will have to be more explicit about
 exactly what problems it causes you...
 
 Thanks.

 But you are the only one reporting these problems.  It works fine for us,
 we can build with zero problems using VC++ 5.0, and many other people
 have compiled it fine as well.  Right now the makefiles are 
 automatically generated from the VC project files.  We do not
 want to have to change to manually creating them without very good
 reason.
 
 Are you sure you aren't using an old version of nmake?  Please 
 cut and past the exact output you get when you try with an unmodified
 source tree.

From where are you getting the sources to do this?  You say

 Please provide the exact version number of your nmake along with the exact
 output when you try to compile an unmodified source tree.

 If you are going to ignore everything I say, please get lost.  
 
 I am amazed at how you are qualified to talk about "everyone else" yet all
 the people that we have that are having zero problems don't matter somehow
 and I have never heard of any of these "everyone else".  I am trying to
 figure out the cause of this problem and a way to fix it, but if you
 refuse to provide the information I ask for there ism't much I can do. 
 
 I would have to suggest your system is really messed up in some way.  You
 can't run the installer, you can't compile properly, etc.  You don't seem
 to understand that we have had zero reports for anyone else with this sort
 of problem. 
 
 I trust VC to generate makefiles it can deal with more than I trust anyone
 else to tell me what it can deal with.  You have to understand that making
 something work on _your_ system, when your system is the only one that has
 the problems, really isn't the goal here.  
 
 We are perfectly willing and very grateful for bug reports and we do fix
 things which are bugs.
 
 The /FD option is probably left over from something somewhere, so it
 probably will get removed unless we can figure out its purpose.  It does
 not, however, cause any problems for me compiling it.  As I have said
 before, we will not be changing the makefiles unless you can provide
 something further to back up your assertions because they are exactly what
 VC generated.  We do not create them manually and will do everything we
 can to leave them in the form that VC automatically generates them.

 If you are going to ignore everything I say, please get lost.  
 
 If you are going to tell your customers to get lost, it's a wonder you have any customers at all. I will get lost, and I'm going to use Netscape FastTrack. It works alot better than Apache, and I won't have to spend countless hours trying to hack it to w ork.

 Just because no one has complained does not mean "they are having zero problems." They probably realized complaining to people like you is fruitless.

 You are right, there is nothing you can do. You are incompetent. And you don't know how to deal with people.

 I think your head is really messed up.

 decompressed it using a strange shareware program I found on the

 work. I might have to hack the source code somewhat in my free time.
