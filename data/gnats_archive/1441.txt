>Environment:
RS6000 SP2 4-way 604 with AIX 4.2.1 (was fine with 4.2.0)
Apache 1.2.1 and 1.2.4 have same problem.

uname -a 
AIX sp2n13 2 4 00040362A400 
>Description:
AIX 4.2.1 upgraded last Sunday from AIX 4.2.0 with Apache 1.2.1 
running reliably for several months.  We needed 4.2.1 to support 
a processor upgrade from 4-way 604 to 8-way 604e in two weeks.
Since upgrade Apache stops responding to service page requests
but processes look fine from ps.  Attempting to stop and restart 
Apache results in zombie process owned by the account running httpd
holding a lock on port 80 preventing a restart of the httpd daemon.
We switched to Apache 1.2.4 but continue to experience the same 
problem.

>How-To-Repeat:
I can't cause it to happen other than it seems load related because the
outages occur during peak usage times.
>Fix:
Even if the outage can't be addressed is there a way to kill the httpd
daemon that doesn't result in the zombie%3

 This feels like an OS bug ... have you tried any aix specific newsgroups?

 I also believe (know) it to be an OS bug but IBM is slow to act so I am
 pursuing all available options in trying to resolve the problem.  IBM actually
 conducted some tests on my machine today and we are sending them a backup tape
 of the root volume so they can put it in their lab and test it.  At this point
 they believe it is caused by an efix they had us apply.  They claim to be
 running Apache 1.2.0 on AIX 4.2.1 in their lab with no problems.  
 
 We took delivery of this machine in June and have encountered one problem
 after another simply running Oracle and Apache.   Until now Apache has been
 rock solid and even now I don't really believe the fault is in the Apache
 code.  IBM is less certain simply because it is only Apache that seems to be
 dying.

 I have looked deeper into the Apache bug database.  Problem 869 looks to raise
 three separate issues.  I have resolved two of the three but the third problem
 seems to persist and might be my root cause.
 
 Problem 869 includes a make report with 4 items of unsigned long assigned to
 int, one error about an infinite loop program may not terminate and the ERROR:
 Undefined symbol: .__set_errno128
 
 I can fix the unsigned long to int type by retyping the variables.  I can fix
 the ERROR: Undefined symbol: .__set_errno128 by using flags -lm variable.  I
 cannot fix the compiler's warning about the infinite loop.  Might this be my
 zombie process?  Might it also lead to the condition of the server ceasing to
 serve pages?
 
 I am going to find an AIX 4.2.0 machine and do the compile there and see if I
 get any of these errors.

 No.  It is unrelated.

 IBM took my httpd binary put it on one of their 4.2.1 machines and were able
 to kill the process without any problems.  We have fedexed them a tape backup
 of our root that they will install on one of their SMP machines to try to
 uncover the problem.  
 
 I put both 1.2.0 and 1.2.4 on an AIX 4.2.0 RS6000 and got the same results
 during the make.  The infinite loop warning still troubles me.  I am installed
 gcc and will try with it.

 IBM provided us with an EFIX to replace an earlier EFIX that was applied
 because our SP2 node was locking-up running Oracle. The EFIX replaced  two AIX
 4.2.1 files:
 
 -r-xr-xr-x   1 root system   2691098 Nov 16 11:43 /usr/lib/boot/unix_mp
 -r-xr-xr-x   1 root system    152748 Nov 22 15:27 /usr/lib/drivers/netinet
 
 The author of the EFIX theorized that the cause was timing related and that we
 didn't experience the problem on AIX 4.2.0 because it manifested itself only
 when asynchronous events occured within a couple of instruction cycles of
 one-another.  IBM revealed that we were not the only customer experiencing the
 problem.
