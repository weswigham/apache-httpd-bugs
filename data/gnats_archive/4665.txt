State-Changed-Why:

Sorry, but there isn't enough information in this report for
us to know what might be happening.  If this is still a
problem, then please attempt to attach a debugger to the
child process, or identify some means of repeating the
problem.

Notes on how to do this are provided at

 Problem can be closed. Forgot to report it.. Sorry.
 
 Problem was a lost include file, that the compiler was using instead of
 the right one. That caused an out-of bounds access.
 
 Is there by the way a neat way to let Apache dump core ?? This required a
 recompile with the -DBIG_SECURITY_HOLE set. Must be a nice way to do it..
