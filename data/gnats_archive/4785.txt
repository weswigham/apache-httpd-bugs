Solaris 2.6
Sun cc/CC 4.0/4.2/5.0
>Description:
If you write modules in C++, at least on Solaris, it is necessary to use CC (not
cc or ld) to link the executable.

It would be nice if it could be configured if the httpd should be linked with CC
instead of cc. I would even propose to use CC as default (if available), so that
any (later added) loadable C++ modules don't get problems.
>How-To-Repeat:
compile a loadable module with CC instead of cc.
>Fix:
My poormans solution is to set LINKER=CC in my environment after applying 
the following patch:

--- apache_1.3.6-2.3.9/src/Makefile.tmpl	Tue Jul 27 22:38:31 1999
