>Environment:
Windows 98, Apache 1.3.6 C compiler is borland 4.6.0
>Description:
I have developed a unix web based drawing program. When ported to win98 I cannot
send binary files via stdout to the WEB browser.  I am using the following C code to force stdout into binary mode. FILE *Save = fdopen(fileno(stdout),"wb");

This may not be a Apache bug as Microsoft Personal WebServer 2.00 also cooks the
binary output.  Any help would be appreciated.  I am also trying the Borland site about compiler probs with binary stdout.

>How-To-Repeat:
I can send the program and code to you provided that the code is destroyed after
you have used it for testing as my employer owns it.
>Fix:
Not as yet but still trying.

State-Changed-Why:

were you writing the output to your Save stream?  If you
opened Save, but still wrote to stdout, this behavior is
expected.
