 Greetings,
 
 I'd like to recap the information I gave you about Excel, explain what you =
 would do if you decided to get involved, go over how the money works and re=
 maind you to visit www.theanswerto.com/timefreedom. Of course, I'll be able=
  to answer your questions by e-mail, or you can call me anytime.
 
 Excel is the number 1 direct seller of telecommunication services in the wo=
 rld! And, since our merger with Teleglobe, now Bell Canada Enterprise in 19=
 98, we are the fourth largest long distance carrier in North America, right=
  behind AT&T, MCI, and Sprint. We own and operate the largest Internet back=
 bone on earth. We're licensed as a public utility in all 50 states, and Can=
 ada...and as of November 2000, we've expanded into the United Kingdom! We'r=
 e listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Montreal and Toronto Stock=
  Exchanges (Symbol: BCE).
 
 Most people haven't heard of us because we don't advertise.... except throu=
 gh "word of mouth." In other words, we don't hire movie stars or sports her=
 oes to talk about us on TV. We don't pay telemarketers to call people durin=
 g dinnertime, and we don't mail checks to people in an attempt to buy custo=
 mers away from the competition.
 
 Instead, Excel pays people like you and me to do two things:
 
 1. Ask a few people we know to try our great services.
 
 2. Find others who would like to make money by doing the same thing.
 
 Over the past 24 months, Excel has paid in excess of $500,000,000.00 (half =
 a billion dollars) in commissions to non-profit organizations and to people=
  like you and me, with not a single penny paid for traditional advertising.=
 
 
 There has never been a better time to start your own business. With Excel, =
 you can partner with the fastest growing public utility in America as we pr=
 epare for global expansion and even more product diversification. You can o=
 wn a portal to a huge Internet mall with an enormous profit potential. You =
 can have all the tax advantages of business ownership with none of the risk=
 s.  You can also establish charitable trusts, which will channel dollars to=
  your organization as unreserved, tax-free donations.  The organizations su=
 pporters make a donation without having to dig deeper into their own pocket=
 s.
 
 I'm sure you'll have questions, so contact me with your phone number and a =
 good time to call. I look forward to speaking with you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Runee Harris
