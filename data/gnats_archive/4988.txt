Linux 2.2.12 i386
>Description:
The contents of the files named HEADER and README used to be pre/appended to
the dirlistings generated by mod_autoindex. In evrsion 1.3.9, this suddenly
stopped working. I've seen this bug reported twice in the database but it
was to my perception misinterpreted by the handling "official".
>How-To-Repeat:
http://beta.jaze.net/bug-demo/
http://beta.jaze.net/bug-demo/HEADER
http://beta.jaze.net/bug-demo/README

The contents of the HEADER and README files should display in the dirlisting
of the first url, but they don't.
>Fix:
Negative.
