State-Changed-When: Thu Oct 18 06:26:15 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Please see http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/
instead... I strongly suspect you found a misplaced, test
distribution (that was purged) in /dist/httpd/ where it
never belonged.

The correct file is apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.msi, it does
_NOT_ end in *src.msi.  Please download the correct file
and try again, see TROUBLESHOOTING first in binaries/win32/
if you have problems before opening a new report with any
further troubles you might encounter.
