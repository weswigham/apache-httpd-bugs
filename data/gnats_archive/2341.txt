>Environment:
Linux 2.0.32, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
The file specified as the RewriteLock file for the RewriteMap I am using is
being created with root as the owner, and -rw--r--r-- as the permissions when
I start apache up (presumably by the parent httpd process). The children
are then unable to access this, presumably as they have given up root privs.

The error message I get is:
"mod_rewrite: Child could not open RewriteLock file /foo/file.lck"

If - after the file has been created, and while the errors are being generated -
I chmod a+w the file, the children stop complaining and everything works.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use a rewritelock for a rewrite map program, and have the user the children
run as be anything other than the user apache started up as.
>Fix:
I guess setting the permissions so that anyone can write to the file is not
secure. Maybe pass an open file handle to the children? I haven't looked through
the code, so I'm only guessing :).

State-Changed-Why:
This is now fixed for Apache 1.3.1 by performing a
chown() to the UID of the childs for the RewriteLock file.
Thanks for your report.
