Windows ME - up to date with any Microsoft Updates as at 11 May 2001
ActiveState Perl 5.6.1.626
>Description:
If a perl CGI contains a system call, the cgi script executes to the system call then stops.  The browser just keeps waiting for the page....

eg.
@args = ("dir");
$temp = system(@args);

The same problem occurs using open().

eg.
open(INPUT,"dir |");
while (<INPUT>) { print $_; }
close(INPUT);

If the above perl script is executed at the dos prompt, everything works ok.
All my cgi scripts, containing the above lines, do work on Windows NT4 with the same version of Perl and Apache installed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a perl cgi with the examples in the description above.
>Fix:
None.

State-Changed-Why:

This sounds like a specific interaction between perl 5.6.1
and WinME, not with Apache.  You may use the printenv.pl
to determine if there is anything missing/incorrect about
the environment variables passed to WinME.  Since Apache
correctly invokes perl.exe itself, I'm closing this bug.

Please refer your question to the appropriate perl lists,
and you might also try upgrading to Apache 1.3.20.

Note, finally, that the console that Apache runs cgi within
is hidden, and that's entirely possibly the reason that
system calls fail on ME.
