>Description:
DefaultType and AddType appear to accept handlers, not just media types.  For
example, the following work:

DefaultType type-map
AddType type-map glorp

Then the files "foo" and "foo.glorp" will be interpreted as type maps.

Is this a feature or a bug?  It seems like a nice feature, but
I don't know whether I can expect it to be supported in future
releases of Apache, because the documentation does not say that DefaultType
and AddType accept handlers--it mentions only media types.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Unless you forsee problems with supporting the feature in the future, I would
suggest documenting it.

State-Changed-Why:
It isn't really a feature or a bug, just a side effect of
how things are implemented.  The behaviour can sometimes be
different than if it were a MIME type because both a type
and a handler can sortof apply in some cases.

There is no reason to use AddType this way, since there is an
AddHandler.

There isn't anything entirely equivilent to DefaultType
(SetHandler is except that it forces all files to be set
that way; if you use it in a Files section you can get specific
cases, eg. files without an extension)

There are a fair number of configurations that do rely on
this relationship between them, but it isn't something we
really want to encourage so it isn't and shouldn't be documented.

Use at your own risk, bearing in mind that we normally want to
avoid breaking things that a large number of people use even if they
aren't documented.
