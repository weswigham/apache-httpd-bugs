Win NT 4.0 Service pack 4. Running binary that I downloaded.
>Description:
After I start Apache, I then enter my local machine, name. I expect to see the "It is Working page". But I don't, instead I am asked to logon thtough my ISP to the Web. my ServerName in httpd.conf refers to my machine name.

There may be an easy solution to this, but believe me, I have spent days trying to resolve this.

Please help.
