State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 30 04:21:10 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:

Yes, I'm afraid that plaintext passwords were inadvertently
broken with 1.3.6.  This is described in last week's
ApacheWeek issue (<http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/99-03-26>).
If you encrypt your passwords with the support/htpasswd.exe
application, they should work again.
