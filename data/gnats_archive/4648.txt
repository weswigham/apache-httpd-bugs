solaris 7, native java
>Description:
After spending many, many hours trying to get DSO to work,
[only to find out DSO is completely broken under solaris and apache 1.3.x]
I finally wiped all my source trees, and started fresh.
I think I followed the directions, and did

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
in the apache dir

then I did

./configure --apache-src=/pathtosource --with-jsdk=/path/here
   --prefix=/usr/local/jserv

it seemed to be happy.

I then built and installed apache.
Then did a make install in the jserv dir (which seemed to not too too much,
 apart from copying one .jar file, and html docs)

On startup, apache  first complained about the ApJServSecretKey,
so I disabled it.

But NOW the main error_log file says
[Thu Jun 24 14:37:37 1999] [crit] (2)No such file or directory: Apache JServ
encountered a fatal error; check your ApJServLogFile for details if none are
present in this file.  Exiting.

and the mod_jserv.log file says

[24/06/1999 14:37:05:195] (ERROR) an error returned initializing protocol
"wrapper"
[24/06/1999 14:37:05:201] (ERROR) in init all protocols "wrapper" returned an
error
[24/06/1999 14:37:05:204] (EMERGENCY) Error initializing protocols


Id like to point out the the mod_jserv message is particularly UNhelpful.
ANd the main logfile error isn't too useful without saying WHAT file it cannot
find!

Upon using the "truss" command with solaris, it appears that there are TWO
problems:


1. it was trying to access "./conf/jserv.properties", and the
jserv install script did not copy that to the apache conf directory

2. it was using a RELATIVE PATHNAME!!
  (relative to the apache server root)

Please fix thse two problems in ApacheJServ-1.0



Oh. and one more problem. I got the message:
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd started


But the httpd still isn't running. It seems to have quit, with NO REASON
GIVEN!!!

This seems to have been fixed when I HAND-copied examples/jserv.conf, to
the apache conf dir, and HAND-EDITED the paths appropriately.
This stuff really should be automated, given that I specified a prefix
in the jserv configure script.
 

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think some of th problems are made more confusing by the "shared" nature
of the INSTALL file.

It would probably help if you had two completely separate files, 
"INSTALL", and "INSTALL.DSO".

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: jon@clearink.com
State-Changed-When: Thu Jun 24 16:19:22 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
DSO installation procedures work just fine on Solaris. The trick is that you need to follow them more closely.

For instance, in your email, you stated that you used the following line for configure:

./configure --apache-src=/pathtosource --with-jsdk=/path/here
   --prefix=/usr/local/jserv

Well, there is nowhere in the INSTALL document that states to 
use --apache-src. On top of it, it states the following:

     For DSO use:
       --with-apache-install=/path/to/apache/installation

I'm not quite sure how that is not clear in the documentation.

There are also many many references to other peoples installation experiences in the FAQ...

<http://java.apache.org/faq/>

We can only do so much with the documentation. Having you just complain and not give us any useful feedback on how to 
actually change the documentation to make it better for you 
really does not accomplish anything. Please be part of the solution, not the problem.

This bug report has been closed.

thanks,

 sigh.  I filed a SEPARATE bug about the DSO problems. Please don't reply to
 my DSO issues under the jserv ticket.

 okay, i typoed that by hand.
 The point being, after GIVING UP ON DSO AND DOING A FRESH INSTALL
 (like I said in my bug report) things didn't work too well.
 
 But for the record, in that situation, the jserv INSTALL file mentions:
 
   "   For a static compile use:
 
        --with-apache-src=/path/to/apache/source
   "
 
 could you not see a fairly close relation to "--apache-src" there?
 
 
 
  On top of it, it states the following:
 > 
 >      For DSO use:
 >        --with-apache-install=/path/to/apache/installation
 
 again, you're not addressing my bug

 Yes, I looked at that. a bunch of different stuff, and I tried the stuff that
 seemed now.

 heLLO, I suggested a SPECIFIC CHANGE. Splitting the INSTALL doc completely
 into DSO, and non-DSO information, instead of having one intermingled file.

 Schmuck. You barely even read my bug report, as is obvious by my above
 counterpoints.

 Of course I could see the relation. The point is that you typed it wrong and
 that would of course cause the installation to fail and would of course
 cause the server to not startup, etc.
 
 >  again, you're not addressing my bug
 
 Your "bug" is that you did not read the INSTALL document properly. I think I
 addressed that perfectly.

 I cannot understand what you are trying to say here.

 The Java Apache project is a 100% volunteer project. If you have issues with
 the INSTALL document, then contribute back to the project by actually
 helping out with the work. Telling someone else to do the work is only
 adding to the problem. Add to the solution.

 Calling me names is childish and is not going to solve your problems.

 I totally read your bug report. I read all of the bug reports that come
 through. The entire contents of your bug report were related to you not
 following directions properly. If you would like to send me a /complete/
 report of your installation (copy/paste your telnet sessions if you have
 to), I would be more than happy to point out all the areas where you messed
 it up.
 
 cya,

 I'm sorry, I thought this was a bug-reporting interface, not a
 volunteer-coordination interface.
 
 Saying you don't want to do the work is one thing. Closing out the bug ID
 is another.

 yeah, that's the right attitude for someone work on bug reports.
