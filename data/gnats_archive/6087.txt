>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
ApacheJServ 1.1.1-b2dev1
>Description:
In src/java/org/apache/jserv/{Ajpv12InputStream,JServConnection}.java, the encoding "ISO8859_1" is used which was not recognized by kaffe by default.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
While kaffe will have an appropriate alias in the next release, it might be a good idea to change Apache JServ itself according to <URI:http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html#charenc>: Use "ISO-8859-1" which is required to be supported by every Java platform.
