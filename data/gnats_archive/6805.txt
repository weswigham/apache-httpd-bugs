>Description:
The following used to work in Apache 1.3.12:
...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/([a-zA-Z\-]+)(/.*)?$
RewriteCond ${langtoext:%1} !=""
...

Similarly:
...
RewriteRule ^/([a-zA-Z\-]+)(/.*)?$ $2 [E=LANG_NAM:$1,E=LANG_EXT:${langtoext:$1}]
...

In either case, ${langtoext:XX} returns nothing in Apache 1.3.14
