(The problem is NOT OS dependant)
>Description:
Tracing mod_proxy's operations using the Explain()
facility is harder then necessary, because all logged
messages seem to come from one source file: mod_proxy.h.

Cause: DEF_Explain is 'called' in mod_proxy.h. This
Macro finally expands __FILE__ as the source file spec
for the messages, and this is always the header, not
the .c file.

(The line numbers are correct, of cause.)
>How-To-Repeat:
run apache with EXPLAIN #define'd in mod_proxy.h
>Fix:
move the 'calls' of DEF_Explain to the .c file
