State-Changed-Why:
There is no 1.3.5.  What version are you running?  It
matters, you can't just make up versions.

Where are your config files?  Do you have
a httpd.conf file in that location?  Well, in c:\apache\conf
it would be.  if not, you need to put one there.

 Marc,
 
 Thank you for your help.  Yes, I do have the config files in 
 c:\apache\conf\, but httpd doesn't seem to be able to find the files.  
 Also, 1.3b5 was posted last week at ftp.apache.org/dist/ last week.
 
 Any help that you can offer would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Martin
