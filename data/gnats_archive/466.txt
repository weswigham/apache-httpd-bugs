Unixware 1.1
>Description:
This has happened quite often:

The server quits responding to a browser and floods the error log with
entries.  While I haven't been able to reproduce this at will, it seems
to happen when I am on a "frames" browser page and attempt to link somewhere
else. Anyway, attached is a copy of the error_log and access_log at a time
when things get goofy:

ERROR_LOG:

[Mon Apr 21 16:03:34 1997] Server configured -- resuming normal operations

	(normal stuff here)

	Now the following happens until I SIGHUP server
	or error log fills....

Thank you for this report.  We are looking into methods
of addressing this.

State-Changed-Why:
User reports that the unixware docs didn't help, and
neither does 1.2b10.  I'm not a unixware user, so I'll just
reopen this one.

State-Changed-Why:
I believe this has been fixed out-of-band by defining
USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZE_ACCEPT and disabling UW's cc 
optimisation in in the server build.  Can you please
confirm that this problem is closed?
