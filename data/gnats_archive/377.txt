>Description:
  When Apache is confronted with a request like "TRACE" or
  "TRACE foobar" (followed by carriage returns) he outputs
  that request in the next line _wihtout_ any headers (eg. no
  'Content-Type: message/http').
  Although the two mentioned requests are a little bogus the
  Apache should output a correct header in response to the
  TRACE request or at least a 'Bad Request' response should
  be returned to the client.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Two possible solutions (as already mentioned above):
- reply with a correct header including ('Content-Type: message/http')
- reply with a 'Bad Request' messag

State-Changed-Why:
Try "TRACE foobar HTTP/1.1" and "Host: whatever".  Your request
is interpreted using HTTP/0.9 unless you supply a protocol
revision.
