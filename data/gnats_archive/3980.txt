>Environment:
I am using Windows 98, JSDK2.0, Java interpreter from Visual Cafe 3.0, and the
latest Apache server (1.3.4) and JServ (1.0b3).
>Description:
I downloaded and installed JServ, and as recommended, also downloaded the Unix
version to grab ApacheJServ.jar and replace the 0 byte file that comes with
the win32 version.  I am getting the same exact error - the JVM is crashing
5 times in a row.  I have no idea how to fix this and the error reporting
is very poor so I don't really know what's going on; given that I have replaced
the empty ApacheJServ.jar file with a good one, I am now at a complete loss
as to how to proceed.

 Perhaps something is wrong with your configuration?

 This fix did not work, and some other people are having the same
 problem.  I have both ApacheJServ.jar and Apache-JServ.jar in my
 directory, but the JVM still crashes.
 
 Thanks,

 Thanks to Raul for sending me the fix to this problem; turns out we
 were still pointing to the Visual Cafe bin directory instead of the
 jdk1.1 bin directory.  Edit your jserv.properties file and make sure
 wrapper.bin is pointing to the JDK bin directory.
