>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
win2k service pack 2
>Description:
installer fails immediately after clicking the "install" button on the dialog (i.e. after all options have been selected etc.). The following error message is displayed:
"Internal Error 2755, 1632, D: path\to\msi\file\. The installer then goes directly to an "interrupted" msg with a "finish" button.

>How-To-Repeat:
exec the installer
accept license terms
network domain: (I have no registered domain name so left it at default)
Server name: (left at default)
[X] Run as a service for all users
[X] Complete - All program features will be installed.
Accept default install dir
click on "install" -->> GET ERROR
>Fix:
tried installing from c: drive = no luck
tried installing microsoft loopback adapter = no luck
tried installing same file onto a win2k server opsys = runs like a dream
loads of hard disk space free
is it something to do with my win2k pro computer not being set up as part of a domain? - it is a standalone as i was going to use apache for testing purposes
