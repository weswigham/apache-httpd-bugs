>Description:
I recently wrote an apache module for my company using the C++ languege. It also uses some self-written Libraries that use exceptions for error reporting.

Now, may problem is that when an exception is thrown, the code inside of a catch-block is not executed. Instead, the whole request is cancled and a "No Object Data" error is sent back to the client.

To get around this problem, I tried to put the whole c++ stuff into its own shared library, which I then dynamically load in my modul's initialisation phase, but this results in the same error.

Is there any solution to this problem?
Thanks in advance for your help!

Regards, Marc
>How-To-Repeat:
Just write a simple module with the following content-handler:

int modcwh_handler(request_rec *r) {
   r->content_type = "text/plain";
   ap_send_http_header(r);
   ap_rputs("before exception!\n",r);
   try{
      throw "exception";
   }catch(...){
      ap_rputs("exception caught!\n",r);
   }
   ap_rputs("after exception!\n",r);
   return OK;
}

No

State-Changed-Why:
Apache does nothing in particular to stop this from working; we have no idea why your system behaves this way nor what your particular compiler/libraries/etc. require to avoid this problem.  The people that write your compiler are the ones who could tell you why this is happening, it isn't an issue with Apache per say.

 I still believe, that this could be a problem with apache.
 
 I wrote a simple C main program (copiled with gcc, not g++)
 that loads a C++ shared library. This library contains just a single
 function that trows an exception an than catches it. 
 (source code available, if needed)
 
 I can run this program and it works fine!
