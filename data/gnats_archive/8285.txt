MS Windows NT 4.0 Server (Build 1381) - SP6a - Spanish language
>Description:
Apache crashes with exception 0xC0000005 when a client double-clicks a link to a PHP4 script that takes some seconds to complete. Single-clicking works OK. After clicking on the accept button on the popup window, Apache reinits child and continues normal operation. PHP is working fine with the same script on IIS 4.

NT popup:
Aplication Error
Apache.exe
Exception: access violation (0xC0000005), Address: 0x11f83b3d1

I've tried some adjustments both in Apache and PHP and gave no result.
Thanks i.a.
>How-To-Repeat:
At a client, double-click, or click repeatedly, on a link to a heavy PHP script.
>Fix:
No.

State-Changed-Why:

This is quite possibly a threading bug in PHP, or simply
an error in your script.  0x11f83b3d1 appears to be in
the PHP engine itself.  Please report your error to that
forum for additional help.
