Windows NT 4.0 SP3, Apache 1.3.1 binary release.
>Description:
I removed 1.3b7.1 and installed 1.3.1, when I run apache I get the following error:

C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache>apache -s
[Wed Aug 05 14:43:05 1998] file .\os\win32\util_win32.c, line 24, assertion "n"
failed

I removed 1.3.1 and re-installed 1.3b7.1 and it works.
>How-To-Repeat:
My access.conf has the following:

<Directory />
Options -Indexes
</Directory>

If I comment this out, it works with 1.3.1.
>Fix:
No.

State-Changed-Why:
Correct, if you check the distributed conf file you
will find out that the Directory / section is commented out
with a remark that it doesn't work and is a known problem.
