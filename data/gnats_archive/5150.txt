>Organization:
apache
>Release:        1.34+
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0, binary install of JServ, binary install of Apache 1.3.9
>Description:
JServ reports problems creating sockets, upon initialization, and dies.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well documented in PR 3642.
>Fix:
The problem is in configuration.  The windows installer does not automagically
set the following parameters in jserv.properties.  The doc in jserv.properties
suggests that JServ can figure these out for itself.  However, I was stuck hard
on this problem, and the following lines made the problem go away.

wrapper.path=c:\winnt
wrapper.path=c:\winnt\system32
wrapper.path=c:\winnt\system
wrapper.env=SystemDrive=c:
wrapper.env=SystemRoot=c:\winnt
