>Description:
httpd doesnt run properly if a directory specified for a CustomLog doesnt exist 

- and apachectl doesnt complain about it in configtest or graceful
>How-To-Repeat:
add to your httpd.conf

<VirtualHost a.b.c.d>
ServerName foo.mydomain.com
CustomLog logs/a_directory_that_doesnt_exist/foo.mydomain.com.log
DocumentRoot /whatever/
</VirtualHost>
>Fix:
change apachectl:
#!/usr/local/bin/bash instead of /bin/sh\

    configtest)
        if $HTTPD -t; then
               suberror=0
                for dir in `grep ^CustomLog /your_apache/conf/httpd.conf | grep virtual | awk '{ print $2 }' | sed 's#/[A-Za-z0-9\.-][A-Za-z0-9\.-]*$##'`; do
                        if [ ! -d /your_apache/$dir ] ; then     
                                echo "$dir does not exist"
                                suberror=$(($suberror+1))
                        fi
                done
                if [ $suberror -gt 0 ] ; then
                        echo "these directories must be created."
                        ERROR=9
                fi
        else
            ERROR=8
        fi
        ;;
    *)


#--------------

BUT - that would ONLY cure a very few instances - a better way would be for httpd itself to actually test to see if it can write a file to that location -
