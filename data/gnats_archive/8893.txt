>Description:
It may be wise to date your HTTPD announcements. Many people do not have the time to keep up-to-date on the Apache web site, and it is often difficult to remember what release we are running. By stating that Apache 1.3.22, released MM/DD/YYYY, it may help jar our horrible memory into recalling that we are down-level.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to the Apache HTTPD Server announcement page.
>Fix:
See Full Description.
