>Description:
I have a host running several personal pages, made by people who aren't too bright wrt HTML.  They find their problems in their HTML and fix them over time--typically, forgotten or misspelled inline images--but I get floods of "File does not exist" errors in the server error_log.
>How-To-Repeat:
Load up a file that doesn't exist; witness 404 error _and_ entry in error_log.
>Fix:
A missing file is a relatively common occurrence and very easy to spot.  Logging it at APLOG_ERR (http_core.c:3094) is a very high severity, and has prompted me to set my LogLevel to "crit" to avoid these messages--something that seems rather blinding for a common message.

I'd like to suggest that this error be demoted to the "info" level, as the obviousness of a missing file is likely far less important than the example for "notice", one level higher, given in the documentation for LogLevel:
        "httpd: caught SIGBUS, attempting to dump core in ..."
