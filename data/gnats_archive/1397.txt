>Description:
The docs for the CookieExpire state that you can use something like:

CookieExpire 3 days 2 weeks 3 years

But apache does not like this. It requires the time in seconds.
The code for mod_usertrack reference mod_expires. I suspect that the 
mod_usertrack docs referenced features not yet implemented :)

State-Changed-Why:
Works fine for me; you need to enclose the expiry
period in double quotes though.  I will see about updating
the docs to make that more clear.

 Thanks for the note. I am glad it is not actually broken :)
