(But that doesn't matter)
>Description:
When defining --sbindir=/usr/local/apache/irix-6.5/sbin
suexec still should be placed in /usr/local/apache/sbin because it uses HTTPD_ROOT "/sbin/suexec" in the src/include/httpd.h file.

I really wish this could be changed to SBINDIR "/suexec" (or something similar).

./configure --sbindir=/usr/local/apache/mysbin

Not realy :-(

 Hmm, I seemed a bit to soon.
 te src/apaci says:
 
 #!/bin/sh
 ## USED AS A COMMAND LINE EXPANDER TO OVERRIDE PATHS
 ## WITHOUT DISTURBING THE KNOWN MAKE BUILD PROCESS DISPLAY
 echo '-DHTTPD_ROOT="/usr/local/apache"'
 echo '-DSUEXEC_BIN="/usr/local/apache/irix-6.5/sbin/suexec"'
 ...
 
 I seem ta have another problem.
 Sorry for the inconvinience.
