>Description:
When an empty style sheet (0 octets file) is loaded, it takes
(on a K6-2 350 Mhz) 17 seconds to load this file.

Here is the trace :

127.0.0.1 - - [05/Feb/2001:23:19:56 +0100] "GET /scheme/guide/html/ HTTP/1.0" 200 12957

After filling the file with <STYLE type"text.css"></STYLE>
the problem is corrected.

127.0.0.1 - - [09/Feb/2001:22:39:31 +0100] "GET /scheme/guide/html/ HTTP/1.0" 200 12957

State-Changed-Why:

Do you have any reason to believe this is a server problem
as opposed to a browser problem?  I have found that 
Netscape often has a very hard time dealing with zero-
length files, and Netscape is also horrible at dealing
with errors in included style sheets.

I tried to test the site you suggested, but it does not 
resolve in DNS.

Please let us know if you can confirm that this is a 
server problem.

Thanks for using Apache!

 First of all, I'm sorry for this very late answer.
 I'm amazed to see I haven't started my personal machine for
 more than twelve days !!

 Two reasons :
 - The same problem appears when using Mozilla M18.
 - The problem doesn't appear when the files are loaded directly
 from the disk, e.g. : loading
 
 "file:///home/httpd/documents/scheme/tutorial/html/index.htm"

 Sorry the right URL is :
 
 http://www.erian-concept.com 
 or
 http://www.open-scheme.com
 
 You don't have direct access to the documentation, you need to download
 the tarballs.
 
 As I'm very sorry to answer so late, I made a special effort to help you
 :
 I have extracted two files (index.htm and tutorial.css from their 
 documentation) and removed a large amount of unuseful lines.
 Extract the full directory with "tar zxvf css.tgz".

 Thanks for providing such a powerful server.
 
 
 Best regards.

 Sorry, but the included file is attached as "text/plain" and cannot be
 easily recovered to anything approaching a gzipped tar file.
 
 If you want to demonstrate a test case, please put it on your website.

 I made other tests this evening :
 - With Lynx : no problem, but it doesn't query for the CSS file
 - With Emacs/W3 : no problem, and this time, the trace of the GET
 		appears in access.log
 - With Opera : no problem, the trace of GET appears also in the
 access.log
 
 In fact, it's clear that the problem comes from Mozilla and Netscape,
 but only via HTTP.
 
 
 Best regards.

Further testing reveals that this is almost certainly
a browser issue.

Thanks for following up.
