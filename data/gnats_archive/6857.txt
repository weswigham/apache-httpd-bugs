Solaris 2.8
Apache/1.3.14(Unix)
ApacheJServ 1.1.2
java1.3
JSDK2.0
>Description:
I use the source code of Apache and ApacheJServ, to compile and install onto my Linux machine. Everything is fine. When I compile and install onto my Solaris machine, I can start Apache and run any html files. But if I run servlets, such as, http://localhost/servlets/Hello, I got an error message (Internal Server Error). I read the FAQ and use its suggested way, but the problem still there.

The log files look like below:

on error_log fiel:

[Thu Nov 16 12:04:35 2000] [notice] Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) ApacheJServ/1.1.2 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Thu Nov 16 12:04:54 2000] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down


on mod_jserv.log file:

[16/11/2000 12:04:47:030] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007
[16/11/2000 12:04:47:030] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: connection fail
