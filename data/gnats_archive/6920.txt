HP-UX B.10.20 A 9000/871
>Description:
In <apache>/src/lib/apr/network_io/sockopt.c references h_errno. 
On my system that variable is defined in /usr/include/netdb.h, but only if 
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is also defined. So when I execute the default configure
and Makefiles I get a compile error.

(Note, I do not believe this is a problem on HP_UX V11; looking over that
version of netdb.h it looks like h_errno is defined)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to compile on HPUX V10.2 (?) I haven't been able to find a patch that would
have affected netdb.h and h_errno.
>Fix:
I don't have enough experience with cross_platform development or what it really
means to HP_UX to define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED to know. The easiest would be:
in sockopt.c
#ifdef HPUX10
extern int h_errno
#endif
