>Description:

Line 2757 of http_core.c:

ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR|APLOG_NOERRNO, r, emsg);

Needs to be:

ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR|APLOG_NOERRNO, r, "%s", emsg);

In case emsg contains a "%" sign.  In our case, emsg was
"File does not exist: molecule%7.gif" and the httpd process went into an
infinite loop in ap_snprintf() while trying to resolve %7.g as a float.
