here is the out from uname:
when I launch configure, after having uncompressed apache_1.3.9-hp9000_715-hpux10.20.tar.gz, this is the output:
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.9
 + Warning: Configuring Apache with default settings.
 + This is probably not what you really want.
 + Please read the README.configure and INSTALL files
 + first or at least run 'configure --help' for
 + a compact summary of available options.
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)

Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html. If you don't
wish to do the port yourself, please submit this output rather
than the patches. Thank you.

Pressing on with the build process, but all bets are off.
Do not be surprised if it fails. If it works, and even
if it does not, please contact the above address.

** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration

 Aborting!
