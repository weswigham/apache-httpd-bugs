>Description:
when i try to start apache, is won't start, and the error_log reads: [alert] gethostname: mod_unique_id requires the hostname of the server.
I guess i have to "tell" apache what my hostname is, but i couldn't figure out how. I have set the hostname in BeOS's network properties.

State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Fri May 18 07:21:25 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
I would guess that the problem is that BEOS logic is needed
in mod_unique_id.c to handle the return code from 
gethostname().  Unfortunately, certain (all?) levels of 
BeOS trigger a gethostname() failure differently than 
all other platforms on which Apache is supported.

Please try this patch to mod_unique_id:

Maybe I can find somebody to do that.

 Hi
 
 I haven't got the /src/ directory (i dont have the source i guess). 
 And frankly i dont know how to apply this patch.
 I'm sure i can do this if i get further directions and/or files.
