I am trying to recompile Apache 1.3.2 using moth_Auth_dbm and mod_auth_db

both times I get 

diasbling DBM support for mod_rewrite (perhaps you need to add -ldbm, -lndbm or -lgdbm to EXTRA_LIBS)

db_Auth_module

Error:  Neither Nerkeley-DB/1.x nor Berkeley-DB/2.x library found.  Either 
disable mod_auth_db or provide us with the paths to the Berkeley-Db include and library
files. (Hint: INCLUDES, LDFLAGS, LIBS)

 Well, do you have -ldb installed anywhere that it can be found?
 
 Did you try following the directions you are given?

 I'm sorry, while you may have said that to an imaginary friend, you
 certainly didn't say that in your bug report.
 
 First, mod_rewrite needs dbm support, not dbm support.
 
 Second, where did /usr/lib/libdb.a come from?  Did you attempt to install
 it yourself, or did it come with the system?  Did you do any messing with
 it after it was installed?  I remember other supposed "bug reports" that
 were due to you messing with criticial components of your system and
 screwing up.
 
 Is there a /usr/include/db.h?
