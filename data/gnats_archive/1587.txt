>Environment:
Linux 2.0.32, i586, Apache 1.3b3.
>Description:
I just finished designing a web page, that when loaded using MSIE 4.0.x caused a client side error of "800c0008". I got in contact with MS, and after reinstalling MSIE the error continued. This error does not occur in MSIE 3.0.x or any version of NetScape for Win95. I had thought the problem to be a HTTP/1.1 error, but after disabling 1.1, the error continued.

However this error does not occur when using Apache 1.2.4.
>How-To-Repeat:
Visit www.completehost.com/copyright.phtml, I will leave 1.3b3 running for the weekend, after that if I have not corrected the problem, I will revert to 1.2.4.
>Fix:
MS Tech said that the error was common to ASP pages, although I use PHP, it is just to include other document components, no special scripting, they said the error could be corrected by editing registry entries in NT for IIS servers, but MS would not release the full tech details on the problem

 Right, it's our bug.  In fact there's two buglets happening.  The first is
 that bputc() does not understand chunking... it's a macro defined in
 buff.h and I guess I missed it.  When it fills the buffer it calls
 bflsbuf() to flush and buffer a single character, but it doesn't call
 start_chunk() before starting the new buffer. Rather than slow down/expand
 the macro any I chose to fix this problem by doing a start_chunk() in the
 bflsbuf() routine.  This bug exists in 1.2. 
 
 The second buglet is that when using bputc(), it is way easy to trigger
 the large_write() code.  What was happening above was that it would
 trigger large_write(), do a 4 element writev() (the buffer, chunked, plus
 a chunk header, the 1 byte to write, and a chunk footer).  A workaround is
 to not consider 1 byte writes for large_write().  large_write isn't in 1.2
 so this bug isn't either.
