>Description:
I can't get access to the web server. I'm using Linuxconf as configuration tool and
am on a network (with access to internet etc).

It's very odd because when I do *not* configure the network I can access the start page (i.e. "It worked--") but
after configuring the network i get the 403 error. :-/

Thank's in advance for configuration help.

Btw. the network is based on Windows computers, and I am using a linux computer to set
up a personal server for php/etc. programming.

Comment-Added:
You're on Windows, so you should specify the drive
letter.  You should also use "include virtual" whenever
possible instead of "include file" and "exec".

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost surely due to a problem with linuxconf.
