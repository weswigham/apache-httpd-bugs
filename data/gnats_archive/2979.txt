>Description:
I'd like to have a way to undo an AddHandler that a previously-parsed
configuration file may have added.  I understand that I can just do another
AddHandler and it would override the previous AddHandler... but, as far as
I can tell, there is no way to revert to the default handler that would be used
if no prior AddHandler had been seen.  

Here's our story:

Our main tree has an "AddHandler server-parsed .html", to treat _all_ .html
files as SSI's.  However, in a subtree, I don't want this behaviour.  I want
the .html files to be handled the way they would have been w/o the AddHandler.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I'd like something like:

DelHandler .html

or

AddHandler none .html

This was made possible by the RemoveHandler directive
add with Apache 1.3.4.  Thanks for using Apache!
