Subject: RewriteRule generates redirect (code 301) but code 200 is logged

>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 4.0 + updates, Linux kernel 2.0.34
>Description:
I have the following 3 rewrites:

RewriteRule ^/~cadams/(.*) /bleh/$1 [R=301,L]
RewriteRule ^/bleh$ /bleh/ [R=301,L]
RewriteRule ^/bleh/(.*) /~cadams/$1 [PT]

This makes http://ro.com/bleh go to the page for user cadams and run everything
as that user (through suexec), and attempts to go to http://ro.com/~cadams are
redirected to http://ro.com/bleh for log purposes (so there is only one way to
get to the page).

Everything works okay except for one thing: when I go to http://ro.com/bleh/,
I get a redirect to http://ro.com/bleh/index.html.  This is okay, except that
it is not logged as a redirect:

205.216.92.19 ro.com - [06/Jul/1998:11:54:16 -0500] "GET /bleh/ HTTP/1.0" 200 233 "-" "-"

This makes log analysis programs think that this is a normal hit, when it is not.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can go to the above URLs to see the results.
>Fix:
Is there a better way to make http://ro.com/bleh map to http://ro.com/~cadams
but still get everything run through suexec?

State-Changed-Why:

Are you using a LogFormat/CustomLog directive?
If yes you are probably using "%s" to reference the
status code, but this means that always the status of
the initial request (e.g. 200) is logged and not the
redirect status. To get the 'latest' status you have to
use "%>s" instead.

See http://docs.apache.org/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats
for details.

 Okay, you hit the nail on the head.  I read (several times even!) the
 docs for mod_rewrite and couldn't find any clues.  Maybe a comment in
 mod_rewrite about this would be good?
 
 Thanks!
