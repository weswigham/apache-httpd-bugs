Linux 2.0.34 (should occur on any OS though)
>Description:
In the ./configure script:
When building the conf_serveradmin and conf_servername the script tries to fill
in the domainname variable. If no 'domain' is found in /etc/resolv.conf it goes
on to look for 'search' in /etc/resolv.conf. However, if multiple search lines
are given in /etc/resolv.conf the domains from those lines are concatted
/with/ spaces). This results in an error when trying to substitute the serveradmin
and servername values from the Makefile.tmpl
>How-To-Repeat:
Comment out (insert #) the 'domain' entries in your /etc/resolv.conf and then
make sure there are at least two 'search' entries. Then just go into the apache
directory and type ./configure
>Fix:
Get the patch from:

 Cheers and good luck!

State-Changed-Why:
This is already fixed for Apache 1.3.2 where we now
use a more robust src/helpers/buildinfo.sh script.
It currently contains :

        if [ ".$domainname" = . ]; then
            domainname="`egrep '^[  ]*search' /etc/resolv.conf | head -1 |\
                         sed -e 's/.*search//' \
                             -e 's/^[   ]*//' -e 's/^ *//' -e 's/^  *//' \
                             -e 's/ .*//' -e 's/    .*//' \
                             -e 's/^\.//' -e 's/^/./' |\
                         awk '{ printf("%s", $1); }'`"
        fi

And the "head -1" above has the same effect than your sed "1q"
command. But nevertheless thanks for your feedback.
