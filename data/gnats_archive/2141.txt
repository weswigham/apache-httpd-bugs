I used the precompiled distribution from the ftp-site.

>How-To-Repeat:
I use a Dell Latitude CP Notebook with the pre-installed Windows95 and nothing special.
I hope you can have the same problem :) Unfortunatelly I could not test with
other notebooks.
>Fix:
Adding some intelligence to the error handler, for example not repeating so
much errors and using a phrase like: "Last message repeated 400.000 times: bla bla bla"

Comment-Added:
The latest CVS is now a bit more intelligent about handling
fatal errors, especially when child processes are concerned.
1.3b7 should be out soon.
