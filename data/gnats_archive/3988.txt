>Environment:
Win95 4.00.950 B
>Description:
I have installed Apache 1.3.4 three times in Win95. Each time, when I click "Apache Server" on the Start menu, a DOS window opens, about one sentence is printed on the screen, and the DOS window closes well before I can read even the first word. I've tried running Apache several times after each install. Always the same result.


Before my last install, I searched the bug database and found reference from an earlier to the need to rename the extension of .conf files. So, I installed and checked all the .conf files. Only highperformance.conf appeared to need a change. I made the change and started Apache. Same result as above.


Another thing I noticed. I did the first install to Program Files/Apache. When the installation was complete, I got a message saying the computer needed to be restarted. I restarted it. Apache didn't work. I uninstalled and was pleasantly surprised to find that the entire Apache directory had been removed. I made the second installation to Apache's default (Program Files/Apache Group/Apache). This time, at the end of the installation process, I got a screen asking me whether I want to view the readme file and a "Finish" button. This screen did not appear after the first install. There was no indication of a need to restart the computer. When I uninstalled the second installation, the directory was not deleted. I did the third installation to Program Files/Apache and this time got the readme file/finish screen as in the second installation. I've not yet uninstalled this set up.

State-Changed-Why:
A change has been made in 1.3.6 which should fix this
problem. Please try it and let us know if there is
still a problem. 

This problem affected people who had an older version of
system MSVCRT.DLL file on their system. The windows 
installer (created by InstallShield) would prompt for a
reboot, and would *not* run the final part of the 
installation (which created the conf files).

In 1.3.6 we have changed creation of the conf files
to happen before InstallShield prompts for a reboot.

Thank you for your detailed explaination of the problem.
While other people had reported this error, there was not
enough detail to find the cause. Your report, by including
a very detailed description of the steps you took at each
stage enabled us to finally find and (hopefully) fix it.
Thank you.
