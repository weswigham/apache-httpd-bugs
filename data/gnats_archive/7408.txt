>Description:
Default httpd.conf lacks "Scriptsock logs/cgisock" description
which is used with CGId configuration.

Without this setting httpd will leave "cgisock" socket file lying around
if ServerRoot and other /var-related setups (like LockFile, PidFile...)
are configured by the admin into different directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
* Configure with --enable-cgid, then
* Set /var-related setup in httpd.conf to somewhere else, like
	LockFile	/var/apache/logs/accept.lock
	PidFile		/var/apache/logs/httpd.pid
	ScoreBoardFile	/var/apache/logs/apache_runtime_status
	ErrorLog	/var/apache/logs/error_log
	CustomLog	/var/apache/logs/access_log combined
* Start httpd.

@@ServerRoot@@/cgisock is left in @@ServerRoot@@ although you thought
all /var-thingies are moved out.
>Fix:
This patch also include ScriptLog doc, which IS described in the manual.
TODO:
	Windows' httpd-win.conf
	Provide manual for cgid, not just in httpd.conf

In long terms we may should not rely on @@ServerRoot@@ for /var things
(like MachineRoot /var/apache ?)

State-Changed-When: Sun Mar 25 08:56:21 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This has been added to the default config file and should be available in 2.0.16.  I did not add the ScriptLog directives, because they are not meant for a production server, and the default config file is very large already.
