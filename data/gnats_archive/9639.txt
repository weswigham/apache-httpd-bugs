>Description:
I have many files with datestamps from before Jan 1, 1970.  Apache
will not serve them with their true datestamps in the "Last-modified:"
header.

Same is true for CGI scripts which return "Last-modified:" dates from
before Jan 1, 1970; the header gets converted to Jan 1, 1970.

I know that internally Apache certainly carries around dates as seconds
since Jan 1, 1970, but many (most?) OS's are quite happy with datestamps
in the range 1903-2038 (i.e. 32-bit signed integer for # seconds offset
from the epoch.)
