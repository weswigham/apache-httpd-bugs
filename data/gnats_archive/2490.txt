I am running Apache 1.2.5, but this is not related to version...

I have a few bash scripts in my cgi-bin directory.  These output a

Content:  text/html

line and then real HTML.  It all worked up until today.  Now, one one server
it only displays the stuff inside <PRE></PRE> loops as non-formatted text!!!

On another server, and until today on this server, the HTML was displayed and
executed properly!!!


If you look at a 'page source' as seen by the browser, the HTML stuff is NOT getting
to the browser from the server.

I have rebooted the servers incolved.

Take a look:

The broken one is: http://www.isone.com/cgi-bin/systat
A working on is:   http://news.isone.com/cgi-bin/systat

These are IDENTICAL SERVERS and IDENTIAL BASH FIles and it does it for ANY CGI
I run!!
