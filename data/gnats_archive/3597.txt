>Description:
I wrote a simple DLL in order to test Isapi Extensions on Apache (mod_isapi) 
-  The DLL is in the /cgi-bin/ directory
-  "AddHandler isapi-isa dll" is in the configuration file
-  "ExecCgi" is set for /cgi-bin/ directory
When I try to open "http://mycomputer/cgi-bin/test.dll" I get
an error : "ISAPI GetExtensionVersion failed: C:/mydir/cgi-bin/TEST.DLL"
In order to test the DLL by itself I also wrote a simple program that loads the DLL , looks for the GetExtensionVersion function,
call the GetExtensionVersion function and everything works fine.
It seems that Apache loads the Dll (LoadLibrary), find the function(GetProcAddress) , but fails when it has to call the function.
What's wrong ????

Thanks
(sorry for my english)

Additional information from user from misfiled PR3781:

PR os-windows/3597

I have tested my ISAPI Dll with a Borland C++ program and I figured out
that the problem should be in the boolean value returned by the
GetExtensionVersion function called from the Dll .
Borland C++ (I think MS C does the same) expects 1 for TRUE
and 0 for FALSE.
ISAPI DLL written in Delphi 3 and 4 (what I used) return 
0 for FALSE and -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) for TRUE.
An expression of the type 

    if ((*isapi_version)(pVer) != TRUE) { return ERROR ....
  
will always return an error because -1 is never equal to 1 (TRUE)
so GetExtensionVersion will always fails when it returns non-zero
for TRUE.	

I tried with the code that follows :

   if ((*isapi_version(pVer)))
	printf("success !\n")
   else 
	printf("failed!\n")

or :

   if (!(*isapi_version(pVer)))
	printf("failed!\n")
   else 
	printf("success !\n")

and everything works fine.		      
 
The code in mod_isapi.c should be changed from :   
   
      /* Run GetExtensionVersion() */
    if ((*isapi_version)(pVer) !=
TRUE) {
	ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ALERT, r,
		    "ISAPI
GetExtensionVersion() failed: %s", r->filename);

FreeLibrary(isapi_handle);
	return SERVER_ERROR;
    }

to :

      /* Run GetExtensionVersion() */
    if (!((*isapi_version)(pVer))) {

ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ALERT, r,
		    "ISAPI
GetExtensionVersion() failed: %s", r->filename);

FreeLibrary(isapi_handle);
	return SERVER_ERROR;
    }

In this way the program will return an error when the GetExtensionVersion
function returns FALSE (0) and
succeed when the GetExtensioVersion function
returns TRUE (1 or -1 or non-zero)

I hope that this is a good way to solve the matter, but
please tell me if not so.
Thanks & Bye
Corrado
