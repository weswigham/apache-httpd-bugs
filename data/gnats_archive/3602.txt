>Environment:
Solaris 5.6 Generic_105181-11 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5
gcc version 2.8.1

>Description:
From time to time, server refuses to execute CGI-scripts
(e.g. counters, mailforms etc..) and reports in the error-log:
(12)Not enough space: couldn't spawn child process: .../blabla.cgi
The server DEFINITELY has no lack of memory or disk space.
The client gets an 'Internal Server Error'.
The times this problem occurs are completely random, there's no pattern.
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem is intermittent, so..
The counter on http://www.soirillustre.be fails from time to time
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
Does it have enough swap space? How about the process table
(or other OS table) sizes? Are they big enough? Sounds like
one of the two is the problem.

 OK, found the problem. Apache reserves a lot of memory
 without using is. This reserved memory is never shown
 unless you type 'swap -s'. This shows apache allocated all
 physical RAM and swap space (+300MB). Stopping Apache frees the
 memory and when Apache starts again, it begins eating
 memory. Why?

State-Changed-Why:
That is your OS reserving memory.  Apache has no choice.
On Solaris, for every copy on write page (which is how a lot
of the httpd processes share memory because of how the parent
forks them) it insists on reserving memory.  Your only options
are to switch to an OS that doesn't do that or just add more
swap.  It never used, but Solaris insists on reserving it.
