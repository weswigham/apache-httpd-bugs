>Description:
We have a set of cgi routines that customers dialing in through our modem pool
*should* be able to access but no one else should.  The following in our
access.conf file has worked in previous versions of Apache:

<Directory /u/info/www/southwind>
    <Limit POST GET>  
        order deny,allow  
        deny from all
        allow from .southwind.net
    </Limit>
    ErrorDocument 403 /non-southwind-customer.html
</Directory>

Now, some browsers get the message:

    The requested method POST is not allowed for the URL /southwind/cgi-bin/checkusage.

Ok, I looked through the bug-report database and saw something similar in
PR#145, and I probably managed to confuse issues initially by posting some
jibberish in comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix a few days ago.  From all outside
appearances it seems that some older browsers are having the trouble, however,
based on the suggestion of telnet-ing to the server port and issuing the request
I get the following from three seperate machines inside our network -- including
the server machine:

$ telnet 206.53.102.28 80  
Trying 206.53.102.28...
Connected to 206.53.102.28.
Escape character is '^]'.

Therefore this does not necessarily appear to be a browser specific problem.  I
have removed the <Limit> block from the aflicted directory as well as making
sure that POST was in, and out, of the Limit block with no observable
difference.

No "errors" are reported in the error log.

Am I mis-configuring the directory?

Please note that this is NOT failing for all or even most customers.

State-Changed-Why:
Can you narrow down the exact names and versions
of browsers that are having trouble?

What does your log show for the requests that are
denied?

What happens if you try telnetting to port 80 and
doing a:

    POST /southwind/cgi-bin/checkusage HTTP/1.0
    Host: www.southwind.net

(ie. add a Host: header to the request you tried before)

If you can't figure anything out, if you can add an
allow for alive.worldgate.com I can try it myself.

 Here is a recent succes and failure from the access-log.  Nothing shows
 in the error-log:
 
 ict1.southwind.net - - [19/Aug/1997:17:17:56 -0500] "POST /southwind/cgi-bin/checkusage HTTP/1.0" 200 524

 Yea!!!  This works is every case that failed before.
 
 Is "Host:" the id of the machine I am trying to reach or the id of the
 machine I am coming from? if I change the value of "Host:" to be that of
 the machine that I am coming from then it fails as before, ex: (from the
 machine topaz):
 
     $ telnet 206.53.102.28 80
     Trying 206.53.102.28...
     Connected to 206.53.102.28.
     Escape character is '^]'.
     POST /southwind/cgi-bin/checkusage HTTP/1.0

 Assuming that the "Host:" pragma is necessary, how can I force it?

 Some of the erm... "features" of the current virtual host code can do

 No, not generally.  You could give it a try though.  What you may want to
 do is setup a test server on a different port and start with a base
 config with no virtualhosts, which may work, then start adding things
 until it breaks.

 My best guess would be that you think it is a part of the main server, but
 Apache thinks something different.   Go through each virtual host, and
 verify that it has a unique IP address that is different from the main
 server.  It may be easiest for you to send the appropriate (ie.
 virtualhost, a bit of the main stuff) parts of your config files for us to
 look at.
 
 This is just a quick comment so that you can see if you can figure it out
 before I get time to go into more depth.

 You could also try against 1.3a2-dev (go to
 ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/from-cvs/ and snarf a snapshot).  The vhost
 code has been partially overhauled again ... at any rate it dumps a little
 message to error_log at the beginning which tells you about the hash table
 breakdown for the ip vhosts.  If you've got less than 256 and they're all
 on the same class C then that'll tell you if you've got any overlaps. 
 Crude, yes (it's not what I intended that message for). 
 
 One argument for "localising" as many of your <Dir and <Loc directives
 into only the vhosts they are valid for is that it saves CPU time. 
 Especially in pre-1.3a2 where you pay O(N*M) time each hit where N is the
 number of <Dir sections and M is the number of components of the filename
 being served.

 Good afternoon Marc,
 
 Ok, latest news.  I have checked all virtual hosts.  All are IP based
 and all are unique.  I will send you all 3 config files if you want but
 first...
 
 We have various bits of config info spread between the standard three
 config files (we have already discssed this).  I am starting to pull per
 virt-host info into the virt-host deffinition but that leaves a bit of
 unassociated stuff sitting around.  Should I assume that once I have
 pulled the per virt stuff within their deffs that everything left over
 is specific to the "default" host?
 
 I have seen reference to the "_default_" virt host.  Should I define one
 of these?
 
 Am I moving too far afield in search for a simple solution to my initial
 problem?
 
 I may pull down the 1.2.4 server today for the heck of it.  One of your
 collegues suggested that I may want to try the 1.3.a1 release since that
 ahs some new virtual host code in it -- should I assume that this code
 is in the 1.2.4 release?
 
 Enquiring (if throbbing) minds want to know.
 Dean...K...

 Yea!! Dean is great!  - actually Marc ain't too shabby either.
 
 This looks like it does the trick.  All of the cases where it was
 failing now work (well, I have not checked with our customers yet but
 confidence level is high).
 
 Thanks guys,
