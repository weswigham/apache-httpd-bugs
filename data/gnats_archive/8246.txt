Windows 2000- Professional, Service Pack 1
PHP Version 4.0.4
Interbase 6
>Description:
I am using Apache Version 1.3.20 with the PHP 4.0.4 extension and Interbase support. I am running Windows 2000 Professional with Service Pack 1.
Apache is installed as a service. 
The value of KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\ControlWaitToKillServiceTimeout is set to 80000.

During the Windows shutdown apache sometimes crashes with the following error message: "The instruction at 0x77a52607 referenced at 0x00000004. The memory could not be written".

I read in previous bug reports that this behaviour was already reported in previous versions. According to the release notes of Version 1.3.20 this bug should be fixed already:

"Fixed system shutdown on Windows 2000 to assure that the modules have
an opportunity to clean up.  Note there is a _very_ limited amount of
time in which to execute all cleanups [see MSKB Q146092] so all of
the modules may still not be given an opportunity to complete their
cleanups if they require more than 20 seconds total."

However the problem still appears in some cases. Unfortunately I can't reproduce this behaviour exactly.

Here are the cases when the error appears / not appears:

When I start up Windows 2000 and immediately shutdown the system the error does not occur.

When I start up Windows 2000 and do my usual work (using Visual Studio, Word, Internet Explorer) for a couple of time (3-8h) Apache will crash when I shutdown the system.

When I start up Windows 2000 and start Visual Studio, Word, etc and shut down the system  immediately the error does not occur.

When I start up Windows 2000 and do not start any application the error does not occur even if the system was up more than 8 hours.

I would be pleased if somebody could help me to solve this annoying problem.

Best Regards
Rainer Falle

State-Changed-Why:
Since this is strongly tied to your interbase/PHP config,
I'm afraid we can't be of too much help.  If the timeout
occurred, your results would be more specific.

The GP fault is very similar to some I've observed mixing
debug-mode and release msvcrt libraries.  If you are a
builder yourself, check that you haven't mixed them (it's
trivial, simply bring up apache in the devstudio and check
out what libraries are loaded.)
