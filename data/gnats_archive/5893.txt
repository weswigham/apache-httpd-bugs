Linux 2.2.13 (SuSE 6.3) (don't think this is needed for this problem)
>Description:
I am running mod_vhost_alias like the following:
<VirtualHost ...>
        VirtualDocumentRoot /local/www/vhostlinks/%0
        VirtualScriptAlias /local/www/vhostlinks/%0-cgi
</VirtualHost>

The /local/www/vhostlinks is a directory where symbolic links point to the directorys where the real webpages live.
Work's fine so far. But the include directives don't work for this.
The files seem to be not parsed but DirectoryIndex .shtml is set and 
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
is set, too.
It work's when i use name-based or ip-based virtual hosting, but not with
"Dynamically configured mass virtual hosting".

I read the thing about "changing DOCUMENT_ROOT dynamically" and that it is not possible. But why don't work things that don't need DOCUMENT_ROOT to be set properly. (like <!--#printenv -->)?

Options +Includes is set global.

If this is my fault 'caus i missed to read the "INCLUDES DOES NOT WORK with mod_vhost_alias" i am sorry.

not working SSI: http://wwwserv2.wor.net/123.shtml  (mod_vhost_alias)

I can't duplicate this problem. Are you sure you have
Options Includes turned on in the appropriate directory?
