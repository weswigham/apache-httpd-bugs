>Description:
The virtual host field in the status results shows just the hostname.
For those of us who run multiple servers with the same hostname but
different ports, it would be useful to be able to distinguish by both
host and port; i.e. "www.umn.edu:80" instead of just "www.umn.edu:443".
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A
>Fix:
The fix is trivial.  I have a patch, but it's for a mod_ssl-patched
distribution.  If the developers think this would be a worthwhile
modification, I'd be happy to compose a patch for the straight up 1.3.9
distribution version of mod_status.c.  Also, should it be protected by
#ifdef's to allow users to include or not include the ports as they see fit?
I have not looked closely at the configuration process from a developer's
point of view, so I don't know how easy it is to add that sort of thing.

 Attached (textually) is a simple patch to add ports to vhosts in
 mod_status for Apache 1.3.9.
