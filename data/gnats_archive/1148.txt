>Environment:
NT
>Description:
mod/mod_dll.html reads: "mod_dll.c file and is not compile in by
default for Windows."  In 1.3a1 it is part of the core project.  
I suspect the doc is wrong and the code is right since this
is a most useful (if not necessary) module in this environment.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_dll.html
>Fix:
The rewrite might replace the first sentence of the first paragraph with:
This module is contained in the mod_dll.c file.  It is only used only windows,
where it is compiled in by default
