>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional, Build 2915, running the Apache 1.3.20 msi package from httpd.apache.org with php 4.0.6 and mod_gzip 1.3.19a
>Description:
I renamed a .pl file to .pl.txt in the hope that people could download it as text without it being run through perl first, however it still gets run through perl. I havent tried it with other file types, but it happens with any .pl.txt file. my httpd.conf is at http://chaz.ro0t.com/test/httpd.conf.php
>How-To-Repeat:
http://chaz.ro0t.com/test/asdf.pl.txt

Contains the following:
#!c:\perl\bin\perl.exe
print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello World";

State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 22 08:48:39 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

In Apache, an "extension" does not need to be
the last part of a filename to have an effect
on processing.  See
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#multipleext
and
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/directive-dict.html#Syntax

This means that a file which windows considers text
(because windows only looks at the last extension)
may be considered differently by Apache.

Thanks for using Apache!
