I changed the httpd.conf file to place the pid file in /var/run/httpd.pid when apachectl start is executed the PID in the file is one lower than the actual PID seen by running ps ax.  apachectl stop (or restart) fail because the PID being used is not correct.

PidFile /var/run/httpd.pid
apachectl start
ps ax | grep httpd

State-Changed-Why:
I have been unable to duplicate this with the prefork MPM.
Are you still seeing this behavior with any of the later
versions of 2.0.16?  Which MPM are you using?

 I originally compiled it with the threaded MPM.  I tried compiling 2.0.18
 with the same result.  I've re-compiled 2.0.16 numerous times with the same
 results.  I tried configuring 2.0.16 using --with-mpm=prefork and everything
 seems fine.
 
 I think I seriously narrowed down the problem.  I was using the default
 values for User and Group (User nobody, Group #-1).  With the prefork mpm
 the server refuses to start and dumps an error about not being able to set
 the group id.  With the threaded mpm it goes ahead and starts one process
 which I can see with ps ax, but the process id doesn't match the one in the
 .pid file.  After setting the group and user to apache (and creating the
 user and group) it starts up correctly and creates several processes (82 to
 be exact).  The httpd.pid file now seems to contain a correct PID (that of
 the first process) and apachectl stop correctly stops the server.
 
 Normally I would run Apache as some particular user, but I don't remember
 (in the past) absolutely needing to change these parameters to run the
 server.  Aparently Linux 2.4.5 is one of those kernels that you can't use a
 Group #-1 setting on?

State-Changed-Why:
A lot of time has passed and I can't tell whether or not 
you got it working.

Note that on Linux, all the many threads from a threaded
MPM (for Unix it is now called worker) will show up as
if they are separate processes.  Make sure you look
at the ps output carefully when deciding whether or not
httpd.pid has the right value.

If you have this problem on current code (>= 2.0.32), please
open another PR.

Thanks for using Apache 2.0!
