>Description:
I noticed that environment variables that do not correspond to the request
are passed to cgi programs. esp. HTTP_REFERER and HTTP_FROM.

My interpretation is the following: HTTP fields that are not set in the request
do not override previous settings in the environment (HTTP_* variables).
Hence the CGI get wrong values that correspond to previous requests 
to the server. 

I noticed this problem with mod_perl, so maybe the problem only appears because
of mod_perl.
>How-To-Repeat:
Invoque a printenv cgi program and look at its output.
>Fix:
Don't forget to reset environment variables.

State-Changed-Why:
I can not reproduce your problem.  As is asked before you
submit your bug report, please try this with Apache without
any extra modules.

Are you _sure_ that you aren't missing something?  Please
look more closely and try making the requsts yourself with
telnet.  I really really doubt that what you say is happening
is happening.

State-Changed-Why:
Closing PR because submitter can't reproduce with Apache
without any extra modules.  Tryy removing modules until you
find out exactly where the problem is, then use the appropriate
support channels for that module.

Thanks.

 That is great, but as we clearly state before you submit a PR, you have to
 find out if this shows up in Apache by itself or not.  We can't support
 every third party module in the world.

 Yes, it does appear like there may be a bug somewhere.

 As the menu to submit a bug report to the apache group includes references
 to both mod_perl and mod_ssl, it did not seem inapropriate to submit the
 bug report here. Another issue is that at least one of the maintainer of
 these third party modules belong to the group of apache core developpers. 
 
 Sorry for your time, have a nice day,
 
 Fabien.

 There's a reason we ask you to try again without those.  See below.

 Yes, and mod_cntr?  The mod_php, mod_perl, and mod_ssl modules all
 have their own development teams and, in at least two cases, their
 own bug reporting mechanisms.  None of those modules are part of the
 base Apache distribution, so it is reasonable for us to ask you to
 try to reproduce the problem using only those base modules.  If you
 can't, then the issue is in one of those modules and your report should
 be redirected to the appropriate team(s).  If you can reproduce it
 with the base distribution, then it's a bug that's appropriate for the
 base Apache bug db.
 
 There are reasons why we ask you to do things.  Right there on the
 bug submission page, it says: 
 
   Before you [submit a bug report], though, make sure you have done
   *all* of the following:
   #6: Tried compiling with only the distributed set of modules and
   with no other patches (so that we can make sure it's an Apache bug
   and not a bug in a module or patch provided by someone else).
 
 All we're asking you to do is what we've already asked you to do,
 and what you've implicitly agreed to do/have done by submitting
 a report.
