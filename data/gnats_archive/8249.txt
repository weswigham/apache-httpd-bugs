Novell Netware 5.1 with SP2,
Apache 1.3.20 Binary distribution from www.apache.org
>Description:
my httpd.conf looks like this:
ProxyPass /somefolder/ http://www.anotherserver.tld/

When i go to http://server/somefolder/
then it gives me an "403 forbidden" error. In the error log i found :
"Filename is not valid: proxy:/http://www.anotherserver.tld/"

But the http://www.anotherserver.tld is ok !
"ping www.anotherserver.tld" from the novell commandline says all is ok.

I hope this is not an error in my httpd.conf.

 The same httpd.conf-configuration with 
 "ProxyPass /foldler/ http://anotherserver/"
 works fine on a Apache on Windows NT4.
 
 I think this is a bug only on a Novell System.
