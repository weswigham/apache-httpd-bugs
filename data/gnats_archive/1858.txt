>Environment:
Linux 2.0.32, GCC 2.7
>Description:
When you compile you hit an error linking mod_auth with everything.
The compiler cannot find the include libraries for crypt on non-us
computers (as the source cannot be distributed outside of the us).
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile on a computer without the source for crypt available (ie: with only
libcrypt.a available)
>Fix:
Have configure detect if there is only libcrypt.a availabl

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Feb 22 21:15:57 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is not source it is looking for, simply the crypt()
function.  libcrypt.a is a library, not source.  If you
had searched the bugdb, you would have noticed 932 other
reports of this.  It is automatically detected in the 1.3
tree.  For the 1.2 tree you need to add -lcrypt to your
EXTRA_LIBS line in Configuration.
>Unformatted:
[In order for any reply to be added to the PR database, ]
[you need to include <apbugs@Apache.Org> in the Cc line ]
[and leave the subject line UNCHANGED.  This is not done]
[automatically because of the potential for mail loops. ]
