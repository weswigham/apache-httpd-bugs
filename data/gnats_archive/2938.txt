>Description:
The server now lets everyone in, and does not ask for a username and password.
I have tried compiling with both and either of
  AddModule modules/standard/mod_auth_dbm.o
  AddModule modules/standard/mod_auth_db.o
but it doesn't work.

The Auth stuff in my httpd.conf file is as follows:

  AuthDBMUserFile /www/data/passwd/passwd
  AuthGroupFile /www/data/group/group
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName HotSexPics

All this used to work, and still does, with Server version Apache/1.2.4.

State-Changed-Why:
First, your authentication should normally be in side some
sort of Directory, etc. section.

Secondly, you aren't actually telling Apache to require
any auth; you need something like "require valid-user" or
"require user foo", etc.

 Marc, 
 
 Please reopen the bug.  I have included more of the configuration
 so that you can see that I am doing that which you suggest.
 Also, as I stated in the original report, it does work with
 Server version Apache/1.2.4 -- so I don't think it's me.

 Sample piece of httpd.conf file.  I'll provide it all if you
 want.

 <sigh>
 
 PLEASE, do you not think that such configuration may be relevant or do you
 just leave it out to make life more difficult?
 
 I'm not trying to be condescending, but it is bad enough that we have many
 people asking for help with basic configuration questions; when you claim
 to be using a config when that obviously not all the relevant directives
 it makes it even harder.

 This is likely your problem.  If you had read the upgrading to 1.3 notes
 you would see:
 
      * When using wildcards in pathnames (such as * and ?) they no longer
        match / (slash). That is, they more closely behave how a UNIX
        shell behaves. This affects <Directory> directives, for example.
 
 You may want to use something like DirectoryMatch and something like
 ".*/hidden" instead.

 Why are you using Limit?  Do you really only want to limit GET and POST?
 If not, leave it out.

 From our upgrading_to_1_3.html file:
 
   When using wildcards in pathnames (such as * and ?) they no longer match /
   (slash). That is, they more closely behave how a UNIX shell behaves. This
   affects <Directory> directives, for example. 
 
 You may want to change your config to use either <DirectoryMatch> or
 <LocationMatch>.
 
 
 P.S.: And you should remove the lines "<Limit GET POST>" and "</Limit>".
       They are superfluous rsp. wrong.
 
 Regards...

 Marc,
 
 Thank you!  
 
 That was the problem.  Sorry for not including the rest of the
 configuration information.  I really thought that it was a build
 problem, and not a configuration problem.  I did read the notes
 on 1.3, but I guess I just didn't understand the implication.  I
 have never fully understood how the <Directory> and <Location>
 stuff matches, despite several readings of the documentation.  I
 must say, however, that the doc has gotten much clearer lately.
 
 I have removed the <LIMIT> statements as you suggested.  
 
 Can you tell me, is there anyway for me to setup restrictions
 that are overridden subsequently as in the example below?
 
 Thank you very much for your help.
