>Description:
Parametric Tech uses an irritating naming structure which breaks many OSes: appending a version number to the end of the .type extensions as in
spaceshuttle.prt.3
With fancyindexing on, I can set
AddDescription "Pro/Engineer Part File" .prt .prt.* and get the expected results
BUT while:
AddIcon /icons/ptc.gif .prt .prt.1 .prt.2 .prt.3 .prt.4 .prt.5 [etc, ad nauseum]
works and spaceshuttle.prt.3 gets ptc.gif as it's icon - 
AddIcon /icons/ptc.gif .prt .prt.* 
Fails, spaceshuttle.prt.3 gets text.gif as an icon, not ptc.gif.
>How-To-Repeat:
simply create an AddIcon typed file and append a version number to it.

(wildcard expressions preceeding the type extensions seem to work, as in *_a.wrl)
