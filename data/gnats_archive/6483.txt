>Description:
 SendFlowersAmerica is proud to introduce FlowerFunds--
 
 This unique new concept will provide an income flow for your 
 organization for years to come.  Your organization is invited to 
 explore the possibilities of participating in FlowerFunds. 
        
 
      $FlowerFunds is an individualized fund raising program for 
 non-profit organizations and schools.
 
      $FlowerFunds are cash rebates that are paid to your 
 organization each and every time an order is placed by your 
 members and supporters.
 
      $The best part is that it costs your organization nothing to 
 participate!!
 
 
 
 How it works:
 
      1.   When your members and supporters order flowers or gifts 
 through sendflowersamerica they determine the price they want to 
 pay; be it $30, $40, $50 or $1000.  Since your members and 
 supporters determine the price, they all can participate in this 
 program.
 
      2.   Your organization receives 20% of the purchase price of 
 the order.  Say a husband buys his wife a $50 bouquet.  Your 
 organization will receive a $10 cash rebate. Nice.
 
 
 
 This program never ends.  Each and every time there is an order 
 placed by your memebers and supporters, your organization will 
 receive the 20% cash rebate.  That's a lot of FlowerFunds, and 
 your organization stands to benefit from a findraiser unlike any 
 other fundraiser.

 Imagine earning money for your organization by making someone 
 smile  :-)
