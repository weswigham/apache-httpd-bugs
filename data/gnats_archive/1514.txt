State-Changed-When: Thu Dec  4 11:10:26 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
You have a broken compiler.  Either you are using a gcc
setup for 2.5.x or you have not installed it properly.

Find a gcc specifically for Solaris 2.6 and install it
correctly and it should work fine.  The errors you are
getting are due to your system header files being broken,
not Apache.

You may be able to work around it by adding a:

#define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

near the start of the SOLARIS2 section, but that is just
a workaround for a broken compiler.

 No, the bug is in the solaris 2.6 header files.  They don't include a
 definition of pthread_attr_t, yet use it all over the damn place.  Maybe
 sun has a patch for this.  There's another open PR on this too, I forget
 the number.  I just got access to a 2.6 machine.

 It worked fine on 2.6 for me using a 2.6 gcc.

 Which version of gcc?
 
 I've sent a note off to the admin of the system I have access to, so I can
 find out how he built the gcc for solaris 2.6.
 
 The problem is that <sys/types.h> is supposed to define pthread_attr_t,
 but for some reason the gcc fixincluded version of sys/types.h doesn't
 include pthread_attr_t.
 
 A workaround is to use sun's cc.  Or to set EXTRA_CFLAGS like this: 
 
 EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include -D__EXTENSIONS__

 And I can verify the same on a 2.6 sparc box with a properly built gcc. 
 
 Apparently there are some pre-built gccs for solaris 2.6 *which do not
 have the proper include files*.  They were likely built on a beta version
 of Solaris 2.6 and need to be rebuilt for the 2.6 release version.  I'm
 contacting one of the sites that has such a bogus gcc on it.
