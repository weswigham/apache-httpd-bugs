>Organization:
>Environment:
Darwin 1.3
>Description:
Apache decides what MIME types are reported depending what filename extension the file has. Darwin and OS X also have what is called a file 'type' which is a four character code like "MPEG".

No extra library need be linked to add support for an OSType -> MIME type mapping.

The relevant header is /usr/include/sys/attr.h

Support for OSTypes would help tremendously when dealing with filename extension conflicts. For example Real Networks lays claim to .rpm as does RedHat.
>How-To-Repeat:
This problem doesn't break anything specifically unless one tries to download .rpm files in a non-Linux browser or similar situation. It also occurs when the file has no filename extension which is very frequent with mac users.
>Fix:
I have not contributed source to Apache before, but feel free to contact me. I would be interested in helping with this specific problem (although it may be so trivial I may end up being in the way)

The relevant header file is /usr/include/sys/attr.h

State-Changed-Why:

Since this is very platform specific, I suggest that the
best way to deal with this is with a new module that
would be used like mod_mime_magic only on Mac OSX.

This module would probably need to be distributed apart
from Apache, since it would not be applicable to most
users.  However, I will "suspend" this problem report
for future consideration.

Thanks for the suggestion.
