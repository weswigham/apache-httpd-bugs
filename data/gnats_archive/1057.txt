>Description:
A web robot rarely wants to add auto-generated pages to its database.  But it
can't reliably spot them.  Apache could help a lot by marking such pages as
not to be indexed by putting:

<META NAME=robots CONTENT=noindex>

into the HTML <HEAD>...</HEAD> section.  This still allows compliant robots to
follow links on the page, which is probably what's wanted.

See <URL:http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html#meta>
for details of the protocol.
>How-To-Repeat:
Look at:

http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&what=web&kl=XX&q=title%3A%22Index+of%22+%22parent+directory%22

which gives "about 274150" examples.
>Fix:
Here's a patch to 1.3a1 -- the change is actually to mod_autoindex, but that's
not available in the picker on the bug report form.

State-Changed-Why:
We talked about it on the developers list, and don't necessarily
agree that index pages shouldn't be indexed by robots.  If
you want to add custom META tags to your pages, you can set
"IndexOptions SuppressHTMLPreamble", and then put a full HTML <HEAD>
section in HEADER.html in each directory.

 Yes.  It is not a good idea.  Index pages can have a lot more than a
 directory index in them.  They can have headers, footers, file
 descriptions, none of which will necessarily appear anywhere else.
 
 This probably would be accepted as an IndexOptions setting if a patch were
 made, but default probably wouldn't be enabled.
