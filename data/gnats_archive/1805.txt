>Environment:
uname -a: OSF1 mustang.vdrea.ru V3.2 214 alpha
compiler: standard cc of Digital Unix (see above)
Apache:  Apache/1.2.4 rus/PL21.0
 The RUS module is a transcoder for different Russian encodings. It does NOT
 patch mod_proxy, though it DOES patch http_protocol.c. Though, the changes 
 look like unrelated to the problem, and the whole module looks so.
 Further info may be found at http://apache.lexa.ru/ (Alas, Russian only;
 but you can relate to lexa@lexa.ru in English). The problem will be 
 reported to them, too. I'll check it on an unpatched server and report 
 the results.

Clients: tried by netscape 4.03 and dull telnet to port 80 (unrelated, IMHO)
>Description:
The issue may be related with BR#546 and BR#558.

My setup:
 intranet www server (www.vdrea.ru) /* not accessible from outside */
  runs single non-virtual host on ports 80, 8081, 8082, 8083, 8084
 proxy server (mustang.vdrea.ru)
  runs a proxy-only, with single <Directory .../dummy>, denied for anyone,
  and single <Directory proxy:*>, allowed from .vdrea.ru
  on port 8080
 They both run as different servers and live in different directory trees,
 both have the same IP address, but different names (really, aliases).

The problem:
 if you try to access www.vdrea.ru thru proxy, you see:
$ telnet mustang.vdrea.ru 8080
Trying 195.1.1.33...
Connected to mustang.vdrea.ru.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET http://www.vdrea.ru HTTP/0.9

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Sat, 14 Feb 1998 04:11:18 GMT
Server: Apache/1.2.4 rus/PL21.0
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>403 Forbidden</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Forbidden</H1>
You don't have permission to access /www.vdrea.ru
on this server.<P>
</BODY></HTML>
Connection closed by foreign host.

And error-log for proxy says:
[Sat Feb 14 08:12:02 1998] access to /usr/local/apache-proxy/dummy/www.vdrea.ru
failed for 195.1.1.33, reason: Client denied by server configuration

Obviously, proxy tried to locally resolve the request, but did not figure out
that it should not handle it by itself and there is another server on the same 
host. It happens even if not only protocol, but a port is declared, as in
http://www.vdrea.ru:80

Why does proxy ever care about local resolution if it has protocol in the URL?
It, IMHO, should try to go to the given host thru given protocol without any
thinking is it local or not.

--- Why does all this matter?
I just tried to use some ErrorDocument directives to make proxy fetch pages
from the intranet server. It failed. OK, I will make them fetched from the 
proxy by allowing local access to its documents... 

But why does it not work (as I expect)? I wonder will it be an issue if I setup
two web servers on the same host with same IP, but differnrt port, will they be
able to see one another? It may be important if I need one of them run steadily
while extensively experimenting (restarting) the other.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Alas, I'm not Apache guru still :-(
I only can humbly propose to determine protocol in URL first, and if it is 
present, not to try to understand if FQDN is local, just to go there...
I may be very wrong... :-%2

State-Changed-Why:

This is maybe a problem with the RUS module itself
or with the virtual host code/configuration.

Have you tried to reproduce the problem with a plain
1.2.x Apache? If yes, can you please verify if the
problem is still existent with Apache 1.3b?
