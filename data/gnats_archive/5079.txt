>Description:
When doing "make install", apache copies a set of include files into the
directory $(PREFIX)/include. This is somewhat dangerous since you have
include files with very general names like "alloc.h", "compat.h", or "os.h".

On some systems this may overwrite system headers when Apache has been
compiled with --prefix=/usr --- what some people do, notably under Linux.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
IMHO it would be better to put the includes into a directory
$(PREFIX)/include/apache and to access them as <apache/alloc.h>, like X11
includes do, for example. This also had the advantage that linking from
/usr/include/apache (or some other place) to the real include directory
will enable programs to find the apache includes without needing additional
-I... statements at compile time.

I am forwarding your message to the list for consideration.
Note that we are in the process of adding a significant 
amount of namespace protection to the future Apache 2.0
release, and have made strides in eliminating the non-ap_
identifiers, including for header files.

I have observed reports of clashes over the alloc.h name,
which is renamed ap_alloc.h in the forthcoming release of
Apache 1.3.13 - but do you have any examples of actual
conflicts with the other header names you cite?

Thank you for your report and interest in the Apache
server project!

State-Changed-Why:
I am closing this report, because this is possible already.
When configuring Apache use the --includedir option to set
where the include files should be installed.  If you are
using a binary version of Apache, the Apache Group has taken
strides to ensure that we install header files in the 
correct place for each platform.
