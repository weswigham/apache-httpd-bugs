>Description:
(category is mod_magic, but that is missing in the list)
if a file fails through mod_mime the default mimetype is used; 
if it additionally fails through mod_magic always text/plain is used;
please make mod_magic make use the default mimetype as well
>How-To-Repeat:
use mod_mime w/o mod_magic and directive DefaultType default/unknown ;
with a unknown suffix you will get mimetype default/unknown as expected

then add mod_magic with an unknown suffix and unknown magic bytes and
you will get text/plain 
>Fix:
patch mod_magic to read the directive DefaultType default/unknown
if no magic bytes are recognized
