>Environment:
Digital UNIX 4.0B using stock C compiler, but OS version doesn't matter for this
bug.
>Description:
I reporting this problem two weeks ago via apache-bugs@apache.org and never heard
back and it doesn't appear in the bugs database.  I'm resubmitting it with the
form to be sure it wasn't lost since I doubt 1.2 should be released with a 
segmentation fault problem.

call_exe() grabs the group for passing to suexec with:

            gr = getgrgid (pw->pw_gid);

And then uses gr->gr_name without ever checking to make sure gr isn't NULL. 
At our site (any many other sites I have seen), users have a unique GID as well
as a unique UID and therefore there isn't a /etc/group entry for pw->pw_gid.
This causes a segmentation fault and core dump on every CGI call.

Additionaly, for sites like mine, call_exe() should pass suexec a group number 
instead of name if a group name doesn't exist.  suexec should accept a group 
number instead of name as an argument.  The patches in the "Do you have any
suggested way to fix it?" section include a fix for the segmentation fault as
well as the fix for using the gid of the group doesn't have a name.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a password entry with a pw->pw_gid that doesn't exist in /etc/group.
>Fix:
These patches fix the problems outlined above.  They are gziped and uuencoded to
protect spacing, etc, which would be lost by a cut and paste into the web form.
