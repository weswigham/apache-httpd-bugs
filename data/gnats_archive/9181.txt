>Description:
Apache serves up a webpage instead of a 404 error when the directory in which the nonexistent file is being requested matches the filename of a module-supported file extension.  For example:

If PHP is installed, or, in the case I found the bug, RACE (but PHP experiences the same problem, which is how I determined it to probably be an Apache bug):

If, in the root directory of the website, there is a file called somepage.php, then the URL

http://www.someserver.com/somepage/thisfiledoesntexist

Serves up somepage.ace instead of giving a 404 error.  As a result, the browser views somepage.ace, but improperly since the path the browser is viewing is different from the actual path of the file.  Either way, however, the file should not be served up at all - a 404 error should be given.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://dev.riverwatcher.com/nematologists/index.ace -- proper.
http://dev.riverwatcher.com/nematologists/index/nonexistentfile -- improper.
http://dev.riverwatcher.com/nematologists/blahblah.htm -- htm file exists
http://dev.riverwatcher.com/nematologists/blahblah/nonexistentfile -- bug doesn't occur.
>Fix:
Apache probably shouldn't serve these pages up... :-)

 More on Marc's comments to you...
 
 it's up to a script to look at PATH_INFO and return a 404 not found
 error if that PATH_INFO doesn't exist.  This has been a server feature
 for years.  Marc was talking about /somepage/doesnotexist v.s.
 /somepage.php/doesnotexist.  You can get rid of the former by disabling
 Multiviews.  The later still works.
 
 2.0.30 introduces the AcceptPathInfo off directive for CGI's (and php,
 and any other handler) that will 404 for you.  In the meantime, it's
 up to your script to report 404 if that's what it wants to do with
 PATH_INFO.
