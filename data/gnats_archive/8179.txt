>Description:
It is very difficult to tell from the 'CHANGES' document if an update is
necessary or not. I would suggest that for each new version the following
sections be created: "Security fixes", "Bug fixes", "Enhancements" and under
each of these catagories the different platform changes should be grouped 
together (e.g. Win32, UNIX, OS2, Linux, Solaris, etc. or all). These changes would
help all administrators (like myself) to quickly decide if an update is necessary
or not. I am happy with the features that Apache 1.3.19 provides, but need to be
able to tell quickly if I should update to the newest version due to Apache 
security issues for the platform that I am running.

If these changes are not possible (for whatever reason), I would suggest at a minimum
that each line start with the platform affected and the word 'SECURITY' if the
change fixes a security issue, 'BUG' for bug fixes, and 'NEW' for new features. 
For example, "Solaris (SECURITY) - fixed bug in mod_xxx which would allow root compromise...."

Thank you for your great work at the Apache Group!!!

Best Regards,

Neil Hare

State-Changed-Why:

This is a good suggestion, but I don't see it hapenning.
The CHANGES file is more stream-of-consciousness, and
it is hard for developers to remember to put ANYTHING
in there.

On the other hand, most releases of Apache come with
a release announcement (sent to the annoucements
mailing list and posted on the website).  This
usually comes a list of important changes in 
a format similar to the one you mention.


Thanks for using Apache!
