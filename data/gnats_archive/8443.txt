>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 2000 Professional SP2, Visual Studio 7.0 build 9254 (aka VS.NET Beta 2)
>Description:
(Note: I was unable to determine if this is the same issue described in PR#7387.  If so, I apologize for the duplication.)

When compiling any project in Apache 1.3.20, hundreds of redefinition errors are generated by <winsock2.h>
>How-To-Repeat:
On any computer running any beta of VS.NET, simply build any project in Apache 1.3.20.
>Fix:
The Windows SDK headers require that <winsock2.h> be #included before <windows.h>, as <windows.h> #includes <winsock.h>, which conflicts with <winsock2.h>.  The solution is to move the "#include <winsock2.h>" line in "os.h" up one line, so that it is before <windows.h>.
