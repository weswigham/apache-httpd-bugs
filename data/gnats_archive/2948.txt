The Redhat people say there is a way to run Active Server Pages, for use such as

State-Changed-Why:
I want to know where the bug is in this report.  This databse is for bug reports.

No, it is not generally possible.  There are zillions of
other technologies that do similar and/or better things,
and people are doing ASPish things but to do ASP such as
it is on NT is quite difficult because it is closely tied
in practice to visual basic.

I have no idea why you need it to use front page though.

 We are using Front Page for most of our design work, and currently do
 not have the talent in our company reference having a database in a
 website.  The easiest way out would have been an ASP.  With us using
 Linux and Apache, I am very open to suggestions for database access
 within a website.  Thanks for your quick response.
