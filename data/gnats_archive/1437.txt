>Description:
after we start the server for about 1-2 minutes ( longer on less busy server ), I
It can open the connection but does not respond to request. The browser show "wait for reply ... ".
And if I telnet to port 80 and issue "GET / HTTP/1.1" followed by two CRLF, it does not give an answer. 
If we use the same configuration but v1.2.4 server, it works fine.

If I restart it, ( send the HUP signal ), it will work again. But after a while, the problem reappear
>How-To-Repeat:
you can run the 1.3b2 and make enough hits . ( around 200 connections at the same time )
