>Description:
<!--#exec cmd="absolutepathtofile" --> does not work.  It yields no SSI error to the output (I normally expect [an error has occurred processing this directive.]).  It logs no errors.  The error only occurs when I include an ABSOLUTE PATH after the cmd=.  For example, my scenario:

File list.shtml is in /home/ducky/www/.  File nlist.cgi, an executable binary with mode 755, is in /home/ducky/www/nlist/.  I have the following two directives in /home/ducky/www/list.shtml:

<!--#exec cmd="nlist/nlist.cgi" -->
This works properly.

<!--#exec cmd="/home/ducky/www/nlist/nlist.cgi" -->
This does not work.  It produces no output.

When I execute /home/ducky/www/nlist/nlist.cgi from the directory of list.shtml (/home/ducky/www), bash gives me no errors.  It runs the program and places its output in the terminal.

The problem is not caused because there are two directives in the single file; I have tried separating them.  I have tried adding and removing a Content-type header to my program's output (though I notice that if a content-type header is added, it is printed into the HTML, which leads me to believe that a content-type header is not expected, rightly, when executing a command with /bin/bash).

I noticed that other people have submitted several bug reports with very similar circumstances.  Apache on my machine is also compiled with suEXEC.  

I have tried applying the patch mentioned in bug reports 4111 and 4412 with original suexec.c and suexec.h files.  The patch did not appear to work completely.  The output that I recieved from the patch command:

[root@blizzardgames.com support]# patch < /root/suexec_patch_apache 
patching file `suexec.c'
Hunk #1 succeeded at 434 (offset 11 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 479 (offset 11 lines).
Hunk #5 succeeded at 531 (offset 12 lines).
patching file `suexec.h'
Hunk #1 succeeded at 140 (offset 1 line).

(Hunks 2 and 4 apparently failed.  My co-admin tried doing them manually, but the problem was still not fixed.)

I hope that I have given you all required information.  Alert me if otherwise.

>How-To-Repeat:
On Apache 1.3.6 (I am not sure if suEXEC is "required" for the bug; I never worked on Apache without suEXEC), simply put an #exec cmd tag with an absolute path and a filename into a ssi-parsed document.
>Fix:
I do not know what causes this problem.  I am aware that certain other web servers perform #exec cmd commands without including the output in the HTML document; to have the output included, a special #config tag is needed.  However, this does not seem to be the case with Apache becuase I find no mention of this in the docs, the #config directive suggested produces an SSI error, and, most importantly, the #exec cmd WORKS when an relative path, rather than an absolute path, is given.
