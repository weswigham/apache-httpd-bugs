State-Changed-Why:
mod_usertrack and mod_cookie are not required for your scripts
to issue cookies.  Beyond that it is known that cookies do
work when issued by standalone CGIs (i.e. not through an SSI).
You should ensure your CGI is properly generating the Set-Cookie
header ... in particular, for testing remove any "path=",
"domain=", or "expires=" headers and see if that gets through.
There are other cookie resources on the net, you might
try <http://www.illuminatus.com/cookie.fcgi>.

Thanks for using Apache!
