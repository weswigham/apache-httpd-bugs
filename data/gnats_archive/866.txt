>Environment:
I am using LynxOS 2.4.0 on a Pentium Pro system.

% uname -a
LynxOS buyo 2.4.0 091096 i386

The compiler is the delivered gcc that comes with the system:

% gcc --version
2.6-94q4

>Description:

I am not able to compile Apache 1.2.1 under LynxOS 2.4.0.

Here is the error:

gcc -c -Iregex  -O2 -DLYNXOS -DSTATUS -DNEED_RLIM_T -DHAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H  http_core.c
http_core.c: In function `set_rlimit':
http_core.c:1046: error: syntax error before `cur'
http_core.c:1060: error: `cur' undeclared (first use this function)
http_core.c:1060: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
http_core.c:1060: error: for each function it appears in.)
http_core.c:1069: error: `max' undeclared (first use this function)
make: *** [http_core.o] Error 1

In order to get this far, I had to change WANTHSREGEX to yes in Configuration.
After that, I got this compile error on line 1046 of http_core.c.  I added the
-DNEED_RLIM_T and -DHAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H flags to EXTRA_CFLAGS to try to fix
this, but it does not seem to help.

I think that NEED_RLIM_T will be necessary, because LynxOS header files do
not define it.  There is a /usr/include/sys/resource.h header file that includes
a struct rlimit definition.  I have verified that this defintion is visible to
the compiler by using gcc -E to check the preprocessed output.

 Um, well, you're adding -DHAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H enabling features that we
 didn't ship turned on for LynxOS eh?
 
 If you look at conf.h more closely you'll see that NEED_RLIM_T does
 something for AIX only.  You'll have to add something to the lynx section
 of conf.h
 
 That should do it ... and when you get it to work if you supply patches
 we can include them in the next release.
