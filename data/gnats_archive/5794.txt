Code tested on:
Linux 2.0.35, 2.0.36, 2.3.13, 2.3.??, Solaris 2.6, 2.7
gcc 2.7.2.3, 2.8.1, 2.9.5
Apache 1.3.6, 1.3.7, 1.3.9
>Description:
At http://www.anarres.org/c/mod_atrack.html is a new version of mod_usertrack.c
I developed to solve some problems with deployment of cookies for statistical
analysis on web sites. The code is still under light development and has been
tested on our production web server for several months. It will probably not
compile under Windows, I do not have Windows to try it.

I am willing to maintain the code in the long term. Please contact me at
<shevek@anarres.org> if any more is required.

Thankyou.
