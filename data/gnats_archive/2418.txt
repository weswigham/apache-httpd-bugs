>Description:
Have built the sw from the src from data retrieved from your website.  I have
built it in a non-privileged directory, using a non-privileged account.  I
have "make install"'d it there, and to /opt/apache.  In all cases, I get the
following error:

Apache is exiting!
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm not sure you can.  COuld you please provide a couple of pointers as to what
I am doing wrong?  I followed the

$ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/sbin/apachectl start

build instructions several times and results are unchanged.  (PREFIX was last
set to me /export/home/rcklein/apache/apache-1.3.0, the root level directory
for this apache version.  Any pointers into the
direction of additional conf or environment clues whould be helpful.
