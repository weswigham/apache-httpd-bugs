>Description:
directory structure:
	/images/test.gif
	/foo/bar.html

bar.html source:
	<HTML>
		<HEAD><TITLE>foobar</TITLD></HEAD>
		<BODY><IMG SRC="../images/test.gif></BODY>
	</HTML>


http://server/foo/bar.html
	bar.html is displayed, image is displayed

access.log entry:
	[31/Jan/2001:10:24:14 -0600] "GET /foo/bar.html HTTP/1.1" 200 121
	[31/Jan/2001:10:24:14 -0600] "GET /images/test.gif HTTP/1.1" 304 -

http://server/foo/bar.html/glitch
	bar.html is displayed, image is not displayed

access.log entry:
	[31/Jan/2001:10:24:19 -0600] "GET /foo/bar.html/glitch HTTP/1.1" 200 121
	[31/Jan/2001:10:24:19 -0600] "GET /foo/images/test.gif HTTP/1.1" 404 308

If the server can figure out where/what the real document is (/foo/bar.html), shouldn't it be be able to resolve relative paths correctly?

Sbehaviour was observed on Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) mod_perl/1.24.

State-Changed-When: Thu Feb  1 01:34:20 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The problem is that although the first (incorrect) URL works
because of coincidental details of your configuration,
when the browser works out the image URL it produces a URL
that does not. The only solution is to avoid incorrect URLs.
Thanks for using Apache!

 that is totally wrong

 no, the browser resolves the relative path by taking
 /foo/bar.html/glitch and replacing glitch with ../images/test.gif to
 get /foo/bar.html/../images/test.gif then resolving the .. to get
 /foo/images/test.gif with which the server doesn't know what to do.
