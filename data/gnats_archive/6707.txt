>Description:
When using Rewrite or VirtualDocumentRoot to set up Mass Virtual Hosting,
the information given in the server-status does not reflect the real Host: from
the request of the client.
UseCanonicalName is correctly set to Off so Apache must use the hostname:port
that the client supplied and it also must put it in the scoreboard so the
server-status can provide the good information.
>How-To-Repeat:
You can repeat it by using VirtualDocumentRoot to set up some virtual hosts and
by calling them (with a Host: header) and by dumping the server-status.
>Fix:
IMHO, you can modify server-status to query correctly the Host: as it was
entered. It means that, with the info in the scoreboard, you must be able to
to locate the connection object with the good Host: and display it.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a known problem. We have looked at a number of
possible fixes but none of them are satisfactory. One fix
would be to revert a performance optimisation that predates
the mass vhosting stuff, which we are reluctant to do. If
you have a patch we'll consider it.

 You can't do it at all because the request_rec is unique to the child
 process that is handling the request, wheras the server_rec is shared.
 Therefore pointers to the server_rec in the scoreboard are globally
 valid, but the same is not the case for the request_rec.

 Yes. In the past the server name from the request_rec was copied into
 the scoreboard; now we just put the server_rec pointer in there.

 No, for the reasons above.

 Yes, have a look at the revision history for details.

 Possibly. The scoreboard stuff has been rewriten, and I haven't looked
 at it yet to see what the issues are.
