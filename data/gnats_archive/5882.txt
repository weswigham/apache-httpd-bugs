gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
SSI fails with too many virtual hosts.  Observed intermittent failure
of SSI's on 1.3.4 -- upgraded to 1.3.12, noted hard failure.  The system
worked before -- the only change has been to add virtual hosts.  System
currently has 1491 virtual hosts (IP-based).

Under 1.3.4, some .shtml pages fail more than others.  (See example
URL's below.)

Decreasing MaxRequestsPerChild from 500 to 25 has improved some SSI pages
under 1.3.4 but others still fail with regularity.

>Fix:
No suggested ways to fix it.  Reducing MaxRequestsPerChild improved
performance for example (2), but hasn't affected example (1).
