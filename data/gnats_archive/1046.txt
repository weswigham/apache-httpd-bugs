>Description:
Users are frequently confused by the interaction (or rather, the lack
thereof) between VirtualHost and Listen.  It's not obvious to them that
they need to specify a Listen for each port they use.  Or that the
existance of VirtualHost statements doesn't limit apache to only listening
on those addresses.  It's probably worthwhile beefing up the Listen docs
and pointing to them from the virtualhost docs.

State-Changed-Why:
Update documentation to:

 * note under VirtualHost description that this doesn't make Apache listen
   to the specified address
 * .. also link to "../bind.html" which explains this a bit more
 * expand Listen description and mention BindAddress/Port
 * refer to Listen from BindAddress
