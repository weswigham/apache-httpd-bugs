>Description:
I have tried to restrict the access to my proxy-server using the example
from the docs. It looks like this;
<Directory proxy:*>
<Limit GET>
order deny,allow
deny from all
</Limit>
</Directory>
Now, all proxy requests to "http://intra.vv.se" will be blocked. BUT
if I enter "http://intra.vv.se/index.htm" it will NOT be blocked!

I've had this problem for several versions now. But I assumed it was
the Solaris implementation that was broken. But it is the same under
Linux...
