>Description:
Dear madam, sir,

I have a problem with Apache that has already occured before. Problem report 4865 concerns the same problem. The problem is that I get the
following messages in the error logfile:

  [error] System: No such file or directory (errno: 2)
  [error] mod_ssl: Child could not open SSLMutex lockfile ...

I have searched your bug database, and others, also the one at www.modssl.org, but I have not found a solution. In reply to bug 218 you say that it will be fixed in release 2.3.11. However, as you can see, I am using a higher version, but the problem still occurs. 

Do you have a solution?

Thank you, 

Niels van Tongeren

You should report this to the mod_ssl maintainers.
It is not a problem in Apache as distributed here.
Thanks for using Apache.
