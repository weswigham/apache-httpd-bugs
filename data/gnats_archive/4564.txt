SunOS coredump 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10    
Compiled on gcc version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Using mod_autoindex filenames with "&" in their name cause that row in the table
to be shifted to the left 4 characters. Ie the last mod size and desc cols for that 
row are offset left by 4.
>How-To-Repeat:
open any file dir with files having the "&" char	
>Fix:
probably parsing the & as part of HTML escape sequence.. I havent looked into the code
yet..
