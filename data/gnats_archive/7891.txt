>Description:
When I use piped logs and chang the Listening port and restart the server, the piped log subprocess still bind the old socket. 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The point is that we should close the previous loop's all listeners in close_listeners_on_exec( the ap_listeners may be changed) func. In fact, the registered close_listeners_on_exec (child_cleanup) don't be executed forever, because permanent_pool (apr_pool_cleanup_for_exec) has nothing to do with pglobal.

State-Changed-Why:
I have just committed code that solves this problem.  There
were multiple issues, including that we didn't register
a child_cleanup until a few weeks ago, when we added the
inherit code.  I also had to make APR create a 
permanent_pool, and all pools had to be allocated out of
that pool.
