 Aborting!

Couldn't get it to pick up the "gcc" compiler.  It could be because it didn't recognize the platform.

I repeated the process several times and ended at the same result by just running the "configure" script.

Maybe if it read the HP platform correct, the other problems I had would be corrected also.

Comment-Added:
I changed GuessOS after 1.3.19 for HP so that slashes in the uname 
output are changed to underbars.  Maybe that change will take
care of your problem.  Try replacing your copy of 
src/helpers/GuessOS with the version at

 umh... the current one available for download from
 http://httpd.apache.org/ would be a good start, instead of one that is
 nearly TWO YEARS OLD, like 1.3.9 is.

 OH,  I went to the binary site for hpux and the only thing there are the
 1.3.9 flavors so I thought these were the current versions.  From the
 download icon on the home page, the only thing I can get is the html for
 apr.  Is there another way to get the latest binary for hpux?  Is there
 something I should be doing so I can get something other than the apr.html?
 Is there a special way to download from the home page link?  Is there
 something i'm not doing correctly?

 There probably hasn't been enough time to respond to my questions below, but
 I was wondering was there another binary available for me to try?  I
 currently attempting to follow the porting instructions, but still no
 success.
 
 It is not my intent to pester the Apache group.

 Apache Group,
 
 I managed to figure out the format to get Apache to configure on the HP
 here.  I just had to adjust the Configure file in the src directory.  Do you
 want the entire fine or just the additions and changes?

Please try Apache 1.3.23. If it fails to build, please open

If you have trouble getting configure to use gcc, try

CC=gcc ./configure ...
