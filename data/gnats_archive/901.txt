SunOS cyan 5.5 Generic_103093-08 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
On Solaris 2.5.1/Apache 1.2.1 if you make an SSI such as:
<!--#echo var=DATE_LOCAL-->
and try to view the parsed HTML, the output is truncated where the SSI occurs
and an error is logged:
[Wed Jul 23 22:35:15 1997] httpd: premature EOF in parsed file /info/www.interact.net.au/html/libraryaccess.shtml

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
enclose variables in quotes when using SSI on Solaris (Linux seems to be
happy to use unquoted variables for SSIs)

State-Changed-Why:
It's suprising that linux and solaris would differ on this.  I
am guessing that you didn't build the linux version from the same
source... or you received it as part of a distribution.  Because
the code in question requires " or ' to delimit the name.

Is that the case?

State-Changed-Why:
The quotes are required by the code ... dunno why it would let
you get away with it on linux... but it doesn't seem critical.
