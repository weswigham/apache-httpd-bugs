>Environment:
NetBSD 1.3, 1.4, all architectures using ELF
>Description:
NetBSD's ELF systems (alpha, mips, and soon i386 and sparc) use ELF-standardized
link conventions.  The patch below is an updated version of the one used in the
NetBSD packaging system, and properly recognizes ELF/non-ELF even in a cross
compile situation (and in an architecture-independent way).
