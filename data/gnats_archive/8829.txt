>Environment:
Solaris 8 (5.8 Generic_108528-09 sun4u sparc SUNW,UltraAX-MP)
>Description:
Apache's log files do not respect the timezone offset for a virtual host when
retrieving static content such as .html or .gif files. Instead, it uses the
server's local timezone offset. Other dynamic content such as .php or .cgi files
don't seem to have this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Setup a virtual host, set the time zone with something like

SetEnv TZ America/New_York

(this is assuming your servers timezone is not in America/New_York)

Then fetch index.html (static content), then hit a dyamic page, such as *.php.
You will see different timezone offsets in the access_log file.

access_log example (see timezone offset):
