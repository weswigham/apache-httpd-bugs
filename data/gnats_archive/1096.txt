>Description:
PHP files work fine when they are located at the main htdocs directory for my
server, but when I try to run my PHP files in either an alias'd directory
or else on a virtual host, i get this message:
Unable to open: /test.htmy
(This is a php error, not a web server error).

I have .htmy associated with php.exe in my srm.conf file using a Handler and an
Action associated with that handler...

Has anyone messed with this and figured a workaround yet?

State-Changed-Why:
We are not able to respond to problems with 3rd party
addons to Apache.  I would suggest you post to the
appropriate newsgroup or use PHP support channels such
as the PHP mailing list.
