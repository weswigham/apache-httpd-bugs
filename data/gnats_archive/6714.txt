>Description:
Guys, this is a quick and dirty patch to let you do "./buildconf clean" which will traverse the subdirectories and remove all "configure" files, thus letting buildconf rebuild them from configure.in's. This should work on any unix that has the "find" command though I have not tested it on any system other than my own, nor put any test in there since I suspect (hope?) buildconf won't be needed for most users once 2.0 is released.
