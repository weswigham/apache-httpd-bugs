UNIX Linux / gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
The following code fragment (in /bin/sh) might be applicable:

.
.
CFLAGS='-DHARD_SERVER_LIMIT=512 -DSERVER_SUBVERSION=\\"ABC/1.3b6/LINUX\\"'
export CFLAGS
./configure ....blahblah...

I have tried 1,2,3,4,5 backslash combinations but I cannot get one that 
will pass the configuration AND perform the resulting make compilation
successfully.  Thus I must conclude that this is some sort of bug in
the configuration process.  I can change the makefile manually to make
this work but I cannot get the configurator to do the right thing.
>How-To-Repeat:
Oh yes...
>Fix:
The workaround is to set the define in include/httpd.h but YKKK.  I thought
things were going the way to prevent having to do this.

*sigh

State-Changed-Why:
I'm confused. I've tried it, i.e.

$ CFLAGS='-DHARD_SERVER_LIMIT=512 -DSERVER_SUBVERSION=\\"ABC/1.3b6/LINUX\\"'
$ export CFLAGS
$ ./configure

(2 backslashes) and it configured and built fine:

:  
===> src/os/unix
gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -funsigned-char 
-DHARD_SERVER_LIMIT=512 -DSERVER_SUBVERSION=\"ABC/1.3b6/LINUX\" `../../apaci`  os.c
:

Are you sure you didn't confused yourself after too
much tests? I tried under both bash and plain /bin/sh
and both times it works as expected. Can you give
us more details?

Fine. Then we can close this resport. Nevertheless
thats for in-depth testing the configuration mechanism
and giving feedback.
