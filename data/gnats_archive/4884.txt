SunOS malt 5.5.1 Generic_103640-24 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2

software built with Sun WorkShop Compiler C++ 4.2
>Description:
I'm attempting the following on an Apache 1.3.x server running on Solaris
2.5.1:

I have 3 shared objects;  foo.so, bar.so, blah.so.  blah.so is built as a
module and will be loaded using "LoadModule."  blah.so uses API calls into
foo.so, which in turn uses API calls into bar.so;  bar.so will ultimately
open a socket to another application.   My httpd.conf file looks like...

...
LoadFile    /usr/lib/libC.so.5        // needed by bar.so
LoadFile    libexec/foo.so
LoadModule  blah_module  libexec/blah.so
...
ClearModuleList
...
AddModule mod_blah.c

There is no need to "LoadFile bar.so", as foo.so uses dlopen() to access the
API routines.

foo.so does a couple things on startup, in its #pragma init routine:
- spits a message about where it's executing, using the output of getcwd()
- reads a configuration file from the current directory, and dumps the
parameters
- spawns a thread that will periodically reread the configuration file
- dlopen()'s bar.so, which in turn reads a config file and establishes its
socket

The behavior is as follows:
- the stdout line after "apachectl start" displays messages from foo.so;
'running in $ServerRoot/bin' (or sbin)
- the configuration file is read and messages displayed, including success
messages from bar.so
- stdout says apache is up and running

- the apache error log, $ServerRoot/logs/error_log  (or var/logs/error_log)
displays messages from foo.so saying 'running in "/" '
- the error log continues with messages from foo.so about not being able to
read the config file (it can't, from "/") and lists using default parameters
- the error log continues with error messages from bar.so, since it can't
read its config file, either;  no socket is established, since the port
address is in bar's config file.

It appears that Apache is loading the libraries twice, the second time in a
directory they're not expecting.

If I change foo.so and config files to chdir() to the "correct" location (to load bar.so and pick up its config file), I get multiple sets of socket connections.  The behavior is as if foo.so got unloaded and reloaded, but bar.so was never unloaded (in particular, it's sockets were never released.)

State-Changed-Why:
Your description of how things work is correct.  That is _NOT_
a bug.  Your code should not rely on the working directory
being set to any particar directory, since there are
no defined semantics about what any particular module can
expect its working directory to be at any particular time.

Like any good daemon, Apache defaults to changing its cwd to
"/" before doing useful things.
