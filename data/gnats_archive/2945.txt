>Description:
Downloaded the source and ran ./configure.  Next I typed make and when it got to util.c
the compile failed:

gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=260 -DDEBUG `../apaci` util.c
util.c: In function `ap_cfg_closefile':
util.c:704: `fp' undeclared (first use in this function)
util.c:704: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
util.c:704: for each function it appears in.)
gmake[3]: *** [util.o] Error 1
gmake[3]: Leaving directory `/export/home/larry/apache_1.3.1/src/main'
gmake[2]: *** [subdirs] Error 1
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/export/home/larry/apache_1.3.1/src'
gmake[1]: *** [build-std] Error 2
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/export/home/larry/apache_1.3.1'
gmake: *** [build] Error 2

I had my CFLAGS environment variable set from compiling my software so that's where the
-DDEBUG is coming from in the compile line.  This is just a typo in the source.  If
I change line 704 in util.c as I suggest below it takes care of the error.
>How-To-Repeat:
set CFLAGS environment variable to -DDEBUG and then do a make.
>Fix:
change line 704 of util.c from:

ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_DEBUG|APLOG_NOERRNO, NULL, "Done with config file %s", fp->name);

to:

ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_DEBUG|APLOG_NOERRNO, NULL, "Done with config file %s", cfp->name);
