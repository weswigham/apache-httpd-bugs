>Description:
Your config docs state (in a couple places):

    # Note that if you include a trailing / on fakename then the server will
    # require it to be present in the URL.  So "/icons" isn't aliased in this
    # example, only "/icons/".  If the fakename is slash-terminated, then the 
    # realname must also be slash terminated, and if the fakename omits the 
    # trailing slash, the realname must also omit it.
    Alias /icons/ "C:/Apps/Server/Apache/icons/"

This works fine without any virtual servers.  If you list virtual servers aliases FAIL if they don't have the trailing slash.

In your bug database it looks like this was reported before and brushed aside offhandedly.  This problem is EASILY repeatable, and it does exist.  Contact me if you can't find it, and I can send you my httpd.conf file.

When I add a line removing the trailing slash from icons:
    Alias /icons "C:/Apps/Server/Apache/icons"

This works on the virtual server: "http://127.0.0.1/icons/"
This fails on the virtual server: "http://127.0.0.1/icons"

Without virtual servers this DOES WORK.

 I have more info.  If the primary virtualhost is selected by default, ie =
 there is no match for the ServerName, then a lot of URL references =
 without a trailing '/' will fail.
 
 testing with URL http://localhost, this exhibits the symptoms:
 
 <VirtualHost *>
 ServerName www.blah.com
 DocumentRoot C:/Code/Web/blah
 </VirtualHost>
 
 this does not (ie this works):
 
 <VirtualHost *>
 ServerName localhost
 DocumentRoot C:/Code/Web/blah
 </VirtualHost>

Please see the FAQ: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ#set-servername

If the ServerName isn't set properly for a vhost or for the main server, then unless you set "UseCanonicalName off", Apache will use the improperly set servername, which your client won't be able to resolve.  

This has nothing to do with the alias directive.

 If that is true, it should fail in both cases, whether the URL ends in =
 "/icons" or "/icons/", right?

 No.  Again, it is only when the server has to generate a redirect.
 When you don't include the trailing "/" for a directory, Apache needs
 to redirect you to the proper URL, the one including the trailing
 "/".

 I see what you are saying, but I already looked into that - I renamed =
 the icons folder to "icons2" and tried the redirect to it with both =
 "/icons" and "/icons/".  Only the latter works.  If the ServerName must =

Comment-Added:
You are not paying attention to what Marc said.  The /icons/ request will succeed regardless of the ServerName's configuration, but /icons will only succeed if ServerName is setup properly.

The reason is simple once you understand it.  If the server gets a request for /icons it must return a response to the client that says that the resource has been moved permanently.  This means that the server will respond to your client telling it to request /icons/.  However, if your ServerName is misconfigured, then the server will put the wrong servername in the response, and the redirect will fail.

For /icons/ the server handles everything internally, which means that the ServerName configuration doesn't matter, the server uses the ServerName attached to the original request.

The reason we don't automatically use the ServerName attached to the original request for the redirect case, is that it may not work properly.  Think of the case where the server is behind a proxy, so you want to return the name of the proxy instead of the name of the origin server to the client.

I hope that explains the problem more clearly.  This is a mis-configuration of the server, and if you fix the ServerName directive, your problem should go away.

 Thanks so much RBB but I am paying VERY CLOSE ATTENTION to what he said.
 He said "it is only when the server has to generate a redirect."
 It has to generate one in both cases.
 Since you are going to be flippant, forget it.

 ServerName is NOT misconfigured.  VHosts are also matched on ServerAlias =

 Marc is right - this is not related to alias.  But this is a BUG.  Why =
