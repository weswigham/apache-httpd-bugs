>Environment:
Slackware linux w/ kernel 2.2.19 running on a quad proc pIII Xeon 700MHz
also have observed the exact same problem on a dual P200, PIII 800, and PII 333 with the same enviroment
>Description:
htpasswd will segfault when using the default crypt() encryption. Works fine with MD5 and SHA but this problem means that when htpasswd is called from the microsoft frontpage extensions administration console, it won't work. The machine is also running ChiliSoft ASP from Sun and the ASP administration console expects htpasswd to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.. I've never seen this work on a slackware 7.1 system so that's a start...
>Fix:
maybe some required libraries aren't included correctly? or if there were a way to compile htpasswd to use MD5 or SHA by default instead of crypt, that would work also since I don't really care what algorithm it uses as long as it works correctly with the default method.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a bug in slackware's crypt library.  A workaround should be to install the descrypt package, however you should open a bug report with them.  They ill-advisedly decided to make their crypt() incompatible with nearly every existing program that calls crypt().
