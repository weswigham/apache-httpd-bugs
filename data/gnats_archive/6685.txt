I'm using :
Linux ns1 2.2.16 #1 Tue Jun 27 11:33:20 CDT 2000 i686 unknown
glibc 
>Description:
I have converted from previous apache and php as buildin module to apache 1.3.14
with php module as DSO.
And I have basicly created the same configuration file I had before.
I am using about 100+ virtualhosts and two of them contains the
php_value auth_prepend_file directive.
It seems that after converting, the latter virtualhost is prepending the file which is mentioned
in the first virtualhost.

e.g. the latter php_value directive takes no effect and the first virtualhost php_value takes effect.

I need to solve this problem quickly since its disturbing clients.

Can anyone assist ?
Thanks in advance.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just set two php_value auto_prepend_file directives in two vhosts.
>Fix:
I have no idea.

I think you'll have a better chance of getting this fixed
if you report it to the php bug database.
Thanks for using Apache.
