>Description:
No core dumps, in fact the log files appear to show that everything is okay.

I've found the problem on two different Apache systems in our company, installed in different divisions, installed by different people.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Create a legal HTML file called  /usr/local/apache/htdocs/xyzzy.html
2. Using any browser, pull up http://www.yourserver.com/xyzzy/bogus.html

For any file xxx.html, a path of /xxx/NoSuchFile.html will serve the file xxx.html.

It's acting as if when searching the directory listing for the directory, if it can't find it, it matches on the closest filename with that prefix.

3. Now, do a   mkdir /usr/local/apache/htdocs/xyzzy
   ...so you have both the newly created directory -and- the xyzzy.html file.
4. The URL now gives the expected 404 error.


This is using the original  httpd.conf.org  file for  httpd.conf
There is no directory aliasing going on.
There are no strange wild cards.
mod_spell is not compiled in.
mod_rewrite is not being used.
No 404 Error rules exist in the config file.
.htaccess does not exist

...in short, we can't figure out why this is happening, it only seems to be happening on the latest version of Apache (as best as we can tell).


This is serious in nature in that it's possible to access a file you shouldn't by constructing a false-path as shown above.
>Fix:
Creating an empty directory with the same filename (not extension) as the help file acts as a work around, but is a horrific hack.


This may just be data-point noise:
Does not appear to be PGP or Perl related.  (As we had one server with those mods and one without both act the same -- two completely different sites.)

The only similar module installed was SSL.  *However* in both cases SSL was not being used by the browser.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri Jan  4 22:05:13 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
please see the docs for the "Options multiviews" directive for why you get foo.html when you ask for foo, and the docs for mod_include regarding how it is configured; when enabled, extra path info at the end of the URL is valid.
