can't help you.

 Marc,
      I have apache server 1.2. level of  code that runs on AIX 3.2.5
 ,AIX4.1.X but does not work on AIX4.3.
 The real problem is when I accessed a password protected server code, I got
 a Username/password
 prompt. After filling in the username and password with the valid UNIX
 userid and password, it refused
 authentication. This only happens on AIX 4.3.  I wonder if it has anything
 to do with the level of
 operating system I use. The real question is ,the server code is supported
 on all the of the AIX operating
 system level?.
 
 I hope this help..
 
 Thanks,
 Chandra Patel
