>Description:
I have a servlet that creates a DB handle in init() and closes it in destroy().
I put in a check to see if the DB handle was being closed at termination, but
it seems the servlet does not terminate when it was supposed to expire.  I guess
I haven't tested if destroy() actually gets executed...
>How-To-Repeat:
Have the destroy() method do System.err.println() to check if it expires at set
expiration time.
>Fix:
No...
