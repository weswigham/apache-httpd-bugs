>Release:        1.3.9
>Environment:
SunOS 5.7 Generic_106541-04 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4 (64-bit Version of Solaris 7 on an Enterprise 450)
Apache 1.3.9 built with gcc 2.95.1 (compiled with HARD_SERVER_LIMIT of 2048)
>Description:
running 'apachectl stop' on this os/machine setup will sometimes cause a kernel
panic, and reboot the server. I believe it is related to incompatibilities with
the 64-bit version of Solaris 7.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Solaris 7 64-bit on a sun4u machine, compile Apache 1.3.9 on that machine,
and repeatedly stop and start it during periods of varying activity.
>Fix:
Write a patch for the 64-bit versions of Solaris.

State-Changed-Why:
You need to talk to Sun about this.  Also, ensure you have
the latest Sun patch cluster installed.

There is nothing Apache can do that should make the kernel
panic unless there is a problem in the kernel.
