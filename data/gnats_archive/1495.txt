FreeBSD 3.0-current
>Description:
Each time I kill -1 Apache, my errors log is full of following messages
(one per each child):

[Sun Nov 30 21:52:59 1997] [notice] httpd: caught SIGABRT, attempting to dump co
re in /usr/local/etc/apache
Ouch!  Freeing free block
Ouch!  Freeing free block
Ouch!  Freeing free block
Ouch!  Freeing free block

It seems that it not affects Apache functionality, daemon looks running after
it and configured properly.

>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry don't have core file to give you exact location of wrong free() call... 
>Fix:
This error appearse first time in 1.3* and it is not present in 1.2* versions,
so it is somewhere in newly added code...

 I can confirm that this bug is _gone_ due to some changes in 1.3b5
 version, so you can close PR
