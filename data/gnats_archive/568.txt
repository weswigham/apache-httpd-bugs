>Environment:
Linux slackware kernel 2.0.30 on a 486 DX100, 16 mb RAM 540 Mb pio2 harddisk
normal GNU compiler, compiling gives no problems. Apache 1.2b7 didn't give this
problem, but the config files where different.
>Description:
Apache is normally working but I can't access any userdirs ( virtual path 
http:/..../~user/ and actual path /home/user/public_html/ ) All may read the 
files, and the dir can be executed and read by all. Apache is running as user 
nobody like in the template makefiles. In fact I didn't make a change to any 
of the options before compile-time. The Userdir is (like default) public_html 
in srm.conf.

My access.conf is here:
---------------------------------
<Directory />
Order deny,allow
deny from All
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

<Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
AllowOverride All
order deny,allow
allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory /home/*>
Options Indexes Includes
Order deny,allow
Allow from All
AllowOverride All
</Directory>
---------------------------------
And it seems OK to me, so I can't find the problem.. Using Apache 1.2b7
everything worked fine.. (NOT the same config files).
>How-To-Repeat:
if my server is running (mostly during european daytime and evening) try:
http://137.224.177.59/
http://137.224.177.59/~olivier/
http://137.224.177.59/~olivier/index.htm
>Fix:
I think it's an config problem otherwise more people would have the same
problem. In comp.os.linux.networking people said my config was OK. that's
why I try here.

 What does the password file say is your home directory?  If it is
 something like /usr/home with /home being a symlink to it, your directory
 directive for /home will not apply.  
 
 What does the error_log say?

 the password file sais /home/olivier/ is a user directory
 error_log tells (strangely) nothing!
 acces_log tells only ....."GET /~olivier/ HTTP1.0" 403 165
 the /home is a physical directory, not a symlink...
 
 what's wrong?
 When I use the standard config file (access.conf-dist) it gives the same
 problem. I recompiled the deamon twice already...

 Try changing:
 
 	Allow from All
 
 to:
 
 	Allow from all

 nope....
 
 the strange thing is: when I make "<Directory /> Allow from all" (remove all
 security) and remove the section "<Directory /home>" I still get "access
 denied"... 
 
 The server is running user 'nobody'. can this be the problem?

 I had assumed all the permissions were ok.
 
 Do a:
 
 	ls -ld / /home /home/olivier /home/olivier/public_html

 No they aren't.  You need world read and execute (although you can
 generally get away with just world execute) on /home/oliver otherwise
 Apache can't read the files.  That is your problem.

 YES !!!
 
 Thanks! I didn't know apache needs to read _that_ directory!
 Do I have to inform the apache bug database? I send a cc to
 apbugs@apache.org is that enough?
