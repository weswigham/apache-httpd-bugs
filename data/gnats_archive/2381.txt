The -lintl is needed for strftime function which is not in stndlibs

I do not know what the -Oacgiltz is supposed to do but it is not a valid
option.  A search for it in the Source didn't find it.  Not neccessary I guess?? or for other version of GCC?

Make changes above to Configure in apache_1.3.0/src/Configure for distribution.

 It is the correct optimization setting for SCO's cc, not gcc.
