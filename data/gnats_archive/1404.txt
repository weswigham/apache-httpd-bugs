Gets the following errors:

ar: warning: mod_log_config.o truncated to mod_log_config.

This is due to the file names being too long.

Is this just a warning or does it actually cause link

 It is an error, make stops at that point.  It has not made a valid archive
 due to the errors.

 Can you please forward a log of the full compile, starting when it
 attempts the ar and ending when you get your shell prompt back after it
 errors out?
 
 Thanks.

 Sorry, I guess it is a warning.  I must have had some other lossage when
 I built it the first time.  I untared a fresh apache_1.3b2. I did
 ./Configure
 and make.  Here is the warning I get:
 gcc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../main      mod_setenvif.c
 rm -f libstandard.a
 ar cr libstandard.a mod_env.o mod_log_config.o mod_mime.o
 mod_negotiation.o mod_
 include.o mod_autoindex.o mod_dir.o mod_cgi.o mod_asis.o mod_imap.o
 mod_actions.
 o mod_userdir.o mod_alias.o mod_access.o mod_auth.o mod_setenvif.o
 ar: warning: mod_log_config.o truncated to mod_log_config.
 ar: warning: mod_negotiation.o truncated to mod_negotiation
 ranlib libstandard.a
 gcc -c  -Ios/unix -Imain      modules.c
 rm -f buildmark.c
 echo 'const char SERVER_BUILT[] = "'`date`'";' > buildmark.c

State-Changed-Why:
Since it appears this is just a warning, and things still
work fine (it appears on SunOS 4.x in some cases as well),
for now we will leave it as is.  There are four or so modules
total that are long enough to generate this; restricting
all modules to shorter lengths really would hurt 
readability and add enough confusion that we would like to 
avoid it if possible.

Thanks for the report.
