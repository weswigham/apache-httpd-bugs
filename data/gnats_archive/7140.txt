>Organization:
>Environment:
Jserv 1.1.2/Win 2K Prof/Apache 1.3.14
>Description:
The Jserv 1.1.2 install on windows is misleading as it defaults to put things in the c:\Program Files directory which causes a problem with starting Java and consequently Jserv(see the Jserv install FAQs).  Be sure and install Jserv in directories *without* spaces in them.  You also need to follow the Jserv installation instructions (updating httpd.conf) because the installation process does not correctly update the apache installation (even though it says it does).

Once Jserv was working correctly, everything was fine.

Another note, restarting the Apache service does not work correctly as there needs to be an interval of a couple of seconds between stop/start to pick up the new Jserv config params.  Stop the server, wait a couple of seconds, then start it, and things will work fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install apache 1.3.14
Install Jserv 1.1.2 using the win32 installation program
try http://127.0.0.1/jserv/, then click on the mapped servlet engine URL, you will get a server error.  The mod_jserv.log file will show:

[28/01/2001 09:30:21:118] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: can not connect to host 127.0.0.1:8007
[28/01/2001 09:30:21:118] (EMERGENCY) ajp12: connection fail
[28/01/2001 09:30:21:118] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "ajpv12"
[28/01/2001 09:30:21:118] (ERROR) an error returned handling request via protocol "status"


For the 2nd problem, make some change to the jserv.properties file and then restart the apache server, you will not see the change reflected.  Try stopping, waiting, then starting, you will see the change reflected.
>Fix:
Fix jserv to properly deal with spaces in the filenames of the wrapper.classpath properties (and possibly other properties)

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: jon@clearink.com
State-Changed-When: Sun Jan 28 10:22:44 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
#1. JServ properly handles spaces in directory names. You just have to make sure to enclose them in double quotes.
#2. Getting JServ to reload its property files: The reason why you have to wait is because you need to wait for the JVM (Java process) to stop. If you have a servlet that does shutdown things, then it may take even longer. It is your job to make sure the JVM is stopped before you attempt to restart JServ. :-)
#3. Why are you still trying to use JServ? You should be using Tomcat. This is clearly stated on the java.apache.org homepage.

thanks,
