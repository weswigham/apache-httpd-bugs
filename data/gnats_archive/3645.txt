>Environment:
Windows 95
>Description:
The proxy module DLL fails to load under Windows 95. I have identified
the cause and am testing a patch to fix it.

DLLs may not use declspec (thread) and be dynamically loaded. My fix
involves replacing declspec (thread) by calls to TlsAlloc, TlsGetValue etc.

I am actually posting this form through a dynamically loaded proxy module under win95
so it does appear to basically function.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well known
