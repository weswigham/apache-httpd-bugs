Hi!  I'm trying to use the Apache Alias directive to create aliases for directories.  I've tried this on Apache 1.3.6 and 1.3.9 with the same results.  Basically, I have some VirtualHosts defined and in each <VirtualHost> section, I want to define some aliases for directories.  I specify the Alias directive like this:
 
NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.1
 
<VirtualHost 192.168.0.1>
ServerName www1.mynet.com
Alias /docs "/mnt/lan3/dir/docs"
DocumentRoot "/mnt/lan1/dir"
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost 192.168.0.2>
ServerName www2.mynet.com
DocumentRoot "/mnt/lan2/dir"
</VirtualHost>
 
The above is correct syntax, but it does not give the desired results. When I move the Alias directive outside (and before) the VirtualHost definitions, it works as I want it to work.  Now, according to the Apache doc, the Alias directive applies to "server" and "virtual host" context.
 
Does anyone know why the Alias directive doesn't work properly when defined *only* in the VirtualHost definition?
 
Thanks in advance for your time!
 
Peace....
 
Tom

 Hi,
 Alias directive works fine both in server config and
 Virtualhost context.
 May be you have some problem with the Virtualhost.
 check for the DNS entry for your virtualhosts.
