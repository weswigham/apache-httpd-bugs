>Organization:
>Environment:
UNIX assumed. Specifics irrelevant.
>Description:
ReadmeName/HeaderName assume .html suffix, which causes problems in DOS 8.3 
environments which have standardized on .htm as the text/html suffix. The 
feature is not accessible in this limited world.

(This is semi-serious to those of us supporting DOS clients, but in the grand
scheme of things, I guess its non-critical. :)
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Either add ReadmeNameSuffix/HeaderNameSuffix directives (or similar) so one can
specify an explicit suffix, of change the ReadmeName/HeaderName directory 
processing to iterate through all valid text/html suffixes configured for that 
server.

The former might be semi-easy but require config file changes everywhere.
The latter would be totally cool, but probably more difficult to implement.

State-Changed-Why:

This is a known issue, and will be addressed when the
lookups for these files are done as subrequests rather
than faked.  One of the unfortunate side effects will be
that a README.gif file may be considered preferable and
displayed instead; if the restriction is made to look
only text/plain and text/html documents, it's possible
(I'm not sure) that then *those* couldn't include images
if they wanted to do so.

But this is on the list; I'm suspending this PR so it won't
be forgotten.

State-Changed-Why:

This feature was handled in later versions of Apache 1.3
with Multiviews, and simply naming readme and header
(allowing mod_negotiation to find them, as long as .htm
was assocated with text/html.)
