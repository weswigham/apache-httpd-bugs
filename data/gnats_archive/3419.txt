>Description:
Relative zone and secretkey property files are relative to where the Java home
directory is not the Server root directory.  For example, if my wrapper.bin is
is c:/jre1.1.7/jrew and I specify a server root of d:/ with ApJServProperties set
to conf/jserv.properties, the jserv wrapper uses ap_server_root_relative to 
qualify the path to the config file yielding d:/conf/jserv.properties.  When
the JServ class references relative files from the jserv.properties file, such
as, zone=root and root is conf/zone.properties, it does not quality the path 
at all. The class simply tries to open the file, in this case, yields
c:/zone.properties which fails.  The JServ class should resolve relative files
to either the Server Root Directory or the directory from which the 
jserv.properties file was read.
>How-To-Repeat:
yes.  Specify a server root in a different directory tree than your current
directory.
>Fix:
A quick fix is to use a path relative to the ApJServProperties files which is
passed in the init routine of the JServ class.  Thus, all relative files would
be relative to the property file or find the server root directory somehow.

Attached is a context diff for the former case for the zone file:

 Folks,
 
 The problem also exists with the repositories in the zone file as well.  I
 would recommend that any files
 referenced by the Java portion of JServ be converted to absolute paths like
 Apache does.  A
 function analogous to ap_server_root_relative.  Perhaps there should be an
 ApJServRoot directive to
 explicitly define the "home directory" of JServ.  This could also be used by
 to potentially solve bug
 report 3417, but maybe there are slightly different from a purist standpoint
 JServ verus Document Root.
 
 Just my two cents/liras.
 
 John.
