uname -a gives:   acer acer 3.2 2 i386
uname -X gives:
Release = 3.2v4.2
KernelID = 93/04/28
Machine = Pentium
BusType = EISA

Compiler is cc (normal SCO C compiler)

>Description:
The output of server-status always displays 0 for the columns:
SS | Conn | Child  | Slot  |

This is not new in Apache 1.20 it existed in previous releases also.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I beleive it *may* be an optimization problem on the SCO C compiler.
Some time in the past i *disabled* all optimizations
and *did* get values in these fields

State-Changed-Why:
If you could try compiling without optimizations, and
narrow down which optimization causes the problem, we
can add a note to the compilation instructions urging
SCO users not to use that option.  Thanks!

Assuming that disabling optimizations deals with this.
