>Description:
Compiling Apache wirked without error (no files from the distribution changed),
installation seems ok.

Used all the example config files to make Apache work, and it is serving local pages.

Now I inserted the lines 
LoadModule status_module "modules/ApacheModuleStatus.dll"
LoadModule proxy_module "modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll"

at the beginning of httpd.conf.

Apache does not want to start. Message:
C:\Apache>apache
Apache/1.3b3
Syntax error on line 16 of /apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /apache/modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll into server

If I comment out the Load proxy directive, the status module gets loaded.

I can't reproduce this problem. Are you sure the proxy DLL
is where you say it is?

State-Changed-Why:
User reports that the proxy module only fails to load under
Win95. I have verified this. I would normally expect this to
be caused by using a function not supported under Win95, but
I can't find one.

 I have as close to zero Windows experience as you can get, but I have a
 need to get Apache with mod_proxy running on Win95 machines.  In order
 to do that, I modified the ApacheCore.mak, Makefile.nt, and
 os/win32/modules.c files to get the mod_proxy compiled into the main
 ApacheCore.dll.
 
 Done this way, it loads fine, and seems to operate fine as well.  I'm
 not sure how much I can help to debug the underlying problem when
 loading it as an individual DLL, but at least this experiment verifies
 that the code can be loaded and executed under Win95.  Hope this helps a
 bit.
