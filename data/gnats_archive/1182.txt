>Description:
The #include virtual="scriptnamehere" SSI directive doesn't handle the SCRIPT_NAME
correctly when given path info.

When a CGI is run from an SSI include virtual directive, any path info given
in the URL gets tacked onto the end of the SCRIPT_NAME. For example, going
to /cgi-bin/test-cgi/foo would run test-cgi with SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/test-cgi/foo.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make an SSI page with this in it:
<PRE><!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/test-cgi/foo"--></pre>

and watch it break.

State-Changed-Why:
This has been tracked to a problem leftover from the horrible
semantics of exec cgi.

This code:

    if (!strcmp(r->protocol, "INCLUDED")) {
        table_set(e, "SCRIPT_NAME", r->uri);
        if (r->path_info && *r->path_info)
            table_set(e, "PATH_INFO", r->path_info);

in util_script.c is valid for exec cgi because exec cgi
is odd, but not for include virtual.  Unfortunately, at that
point we have no way to tell the two apart.  The fix (ie.
don't run the above special case for include virtual) is obvious
but the way to do it in the poorly abstracted CGI and SSI implementation
isn't.

ISTR some work in this area.. I can't seem to reproduce
this on 1.3b7.  Can you try setting up a 1.3b7 server
and seeing if it fixes your problem?
