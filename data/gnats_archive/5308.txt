>Description:
The httpd server suddenly crashes every couple of hours.
We are using PHP3 with Mysql and the pages are quite database driven. 
Also the site is quite busy and does about 3 million page views every 
month. We invariably restart it using apachectl. Also right now I have 
setup a cronjob that restarts the Apache server every three hours. The 
only setting that I have changed is MaxRequestsPerChild 100. 

The log entry is: 

[Sat Nov 13 21:00:01 1999] [warn] child process 9038 still did not exit, sending
 a SIGTERM
[Sat Nov 13 21:00:06 1999] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[Sun Nov 14 01:46:22 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 mod_perl/1.21
 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Sun Nov 14 01:48:12 1999] [error] [client 202.60.128.3] Invalid URI in request
Connection: close
[Sun Nov 14 01:48:52 1999] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
[Sun Nov 14 01:48:53 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 mod_perl/1.21

Normally I will see only the last two entries. 
Any help will be really appreciated.
