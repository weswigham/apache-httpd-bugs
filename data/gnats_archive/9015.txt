should be the same on all platforms
>Description:
It would be handy to have something like apachectl status but which displays
the current status of apache on the command line.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
like:

# apachectl status
/usr/sbin/apachectl status: httpd (pid %d) is running

or:

# apachectl status
/usr/sbin/apachectl status: httpd (pid %d) is stopped

if this would also set the return value accordingly this would also be useable in shell-scripts.
