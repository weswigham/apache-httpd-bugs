 This is a forwarding copy to you of an email that we sent to     
 BET.--
 
 **********************************************************
 Regarding the non-renewal of Tavis Smiley's contract:  
 apparently you--BET, Viacom and your sponsors don't fully 
 understand black people.  You apparently have determined that 
 we want to be fed only a diet of rap music and comedy--without 
 balancing it with commentary and mentally stimulating 
 programming.  You are OH SO WRONG!  As a college educated, 
 highly articulate, self thinking black person-- I have chosen to 
 cease from viewing your programming.
  
 Having in my possession some 400,000 african american email 
 addresses-- I am forwarding this email to them. What they do with 
 the info is a personal choice-- however, I can predict much of the 
 reaction-- Can you?
