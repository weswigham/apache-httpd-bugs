>Description:
I believe this is a problem that is due to Netscape but any help or advice that 
you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

If we use NCSA for the same sites we have no problem.

The problem is that when we serve out some of our sites with apache, it causes 
Netscape 4.06 (and other 4.x versions) to crash.  The browser does a refresh the 
first time you visit the site(i.e. full reload of all files on page) which can  
cause the browser to crash with an illegal operation.

What are the differences between Apache and NCSA that could be problematic (for 
example I was thinking it is one of the modules, but don't know how this would 
be).

I would really like to address this problem as We are reluctant to go across 
to Apache permanently until we are sure that this problem cannot happen.

Thanks in advance for any help offered


Cheers,

Derek Smith
