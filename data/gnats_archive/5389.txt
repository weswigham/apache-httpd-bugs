>Description:

mod_rewrite is *SEVERELY* broken by a one-character bug introduced in version
1.148.  The bug causes the next-to-last backref substitution to never happen...
if you only have one backref, the $1 disappears without a trace!  This is
described more fully with an example in a followup to PR#4766.

Following is a patch against mod_rewrite.c version 1.152 that fixes the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
See followups to PR#4766 for a demonstration.
