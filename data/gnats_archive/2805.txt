>Description:
If httpd.conf has syntactically incorrect information Apache won't start.
This applies even if the only error is for a single <virtual host>.
Especially for ISPs running apache with many virtual servers it would be highly 
preferable to start apache WITHOUT the erroneously formatted virtual host,
but WITH all other virtual hosts running normally.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
First check syntax on each virtual host individually. Then, ignore any incorrectly 
formatted virtual hosts. Log that Apache is starting without without the virtual host to 
STDERR and/or Syslog. Start apache with remaining virtual hosts.

State-Changed-Why:
It is a very bad thing to magically ignore settings that
are incorrect.  There is no way to tell if it is just
an unimportant vhost that can be ignored or if it is
a very important directive that will result in major
problems (eg. huge security hole) if not done properly.

You can't let just anyone edit your *.conf files anyway, so
I really don't see the point of ignoring errors.  If you
want, you can run "httpd -t" (or apachectl configtest) to
test config files before restarting.

 My bug report is a serious ISP situation.
 
 There is a big difference between ignoring an incorrect directive and not setting 
 up one of the several virtual servers: Apache is commonly run with many 
 independent IP based virtual servers. You cannot tell if a directive is important, 
 but it is always true is that one less virtual server is better than none at all.
 
 If a directive for a virtual host is malformed it could result in that server being 
 compromised, and so that virtual host should not be started. However that 
 malformed directive would only have affected a single virtual host if it had 
 succeeded, so it should only affect that one if it fails. Of course, my bug report 
 does not apply to global directives.
 
 Example:
 
 <virtualhost 10.1.1.1>
 # This works
 DocumentRoot /usr/httpd/htdocs1
 RewriteRule  ^/private/(.*) /cgi-bin/private.cgi?$1
 </virtualhost>
 
 <virtualhost 10.1.1.2>
 # This fails 
 DocumentRoot /usr/httpd/htdocs2
 ReriteRul  ^/private/(.*) /cgi-bin/private.cgi?$1
 </virtualhost>
 
 I can't see why 10.1.1.1 should not start, with 10.1.1.2 failing.

 As an ISP we give each of our customers their own virtualhost.
 We would like to be able to give them an interface to insert their own
 directives, at their own risk. 
 
 We can make our own interface so that they can only edit their own bit of 
 httpd.conf. Obviously they won't get direct access, but figure:
 
 ....
 <virtualhost 10.1.1.1>
 #### PERL MATCH ME
 #### INSERT FILE : /home/10.1.1.1/Apache.conf
 #### END PERL MATCH
 </virtualhost>
 
 Then Perl script generates a new httpd.conf and a Suid program simply restarts 
 server.
 
 However we can't give let our customers insert their own directives if screwing 
 up their own server would also screw everyone else's.

 Perhaps it is always true for _YOU_, but that is a very dangerous
 assumption to make in the general case.  It could lead to anything from
 serious security holes to very embarassing situations if the wrong
 documentroot is used for things.

 There are many cases where it isn't that simple.  Apache shouldn't be
 randomly guessing when ti ignore directives.

 And you just opened up your server to massive security holes.  We don't
 support that either.  You can't just give untrusted users the ability to
 make almost arbitrary modifications to your config file.

 Checking that the config file is valid won't do much to stop that.
 Regardless, as I already told you, you can just use the -t option to check
 a config file to see if it has syntax errors before accepting their
 changes.
