FreeBSD-3.3-RELEASE
>Description:
Imagine that you mistyped <Dir> in
ErrorLog <Dir>/httpd-error directive (in any *Log, actually).
Then when you'll try to [re]start apache, it will not start and
no information will be recorded into it's error log file

You may actually specify incorrect path in one virtual host,
and main error log will miss that error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure main ErrorLog correctly, 
add VirtualHost with
TransferLog /some/unexistent/path/error.log
and [re]start apache.

You will see no notice in your main ErrorLog.
