>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Using mod_rewrite and (at least) mod_WebObjects, the module from Apple that provides a module way to access WebObjects applications, rather than cgi
>Description:
Passthrough rules don't uri-escape the arguments, which is necessary for at least WebObjects module, and probably others.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a passthrough rule like
RewriteRule ^/Foo/bar/([a-zA-Z0-9\ ]+)$ /Otherfoo/otherbar?something=$1 [PT]
and when the $1 contains a space, any other handlers (at least Webobjects, I guess other ones as well) get confused because the URL has a space in it.
>Fix:
Here's my patch - it even honours the NE flag.  It doesn't change the escaping/non-escaping of the uri - that may also need to be added, in similar fashion to how it is done for Redirects. 
(diff is diff -C3 format as HPUX diff doesn't handle unified format, or I couldn't convince it to do so)
