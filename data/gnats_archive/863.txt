State-Changed-Why:
I'm sorry, I can not even begin to understand what you are
talking about.  I can assure you that the server doesn't
magically bypass access restrictions.  If we are to have
any hope of helping, you need to say exactly what you are
doing and what you think it should do.

 This is really a configuration question and, as the instructions clearly
 say, the bugdb is for bugs not configuration questions.

 The answer to why this doesn't work is below in the other section you
 quote.  You have an "AllowOverride None" for that directory, which
 prevents you from using .htaccess files for doing anything.

 If you use a Location directive, it acts as a Location directive.  That is
 different from a Directory directive.  Please read the manual for details.
