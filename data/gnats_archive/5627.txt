 Hi,
 
      It's the Apache JServ engine which does the
 unloading of 
      servlet from the memory depending on its own
 algorithm to relinquish any resources 
      allocated for the servlet.
 
      You can force the servlet to unload it from the
 memory by restarting the 
      Apache Server.

 Hi,
 
 Thanks for the response.
 
 I have 2 more issues:
 
 1. Isn't there a way to unload servlet without restarting Apache server?
 You mean I have to restart the server each time I test my servlet, too many
 restarts.  Also, not anyone can restart the server.
 
 2. Even though I bounce the Apache server, the servlet seems to remain
 there:  I killed the Apache server and JServ with Ctrl-C (was run in console
 mode), modified my servlet, compiled servlet, launched Apache and JServ,
 tested the servlet but still didn't see the changes.  The log file jserv.log
 didn't even show that the method init is called.
 
 The only way I will see the changes is to reboot my PC.
 
 I am attaching my servlet for your reference.
 
 Have I done anything wrong?
 
 Thanks for any info.
 
 Alex
