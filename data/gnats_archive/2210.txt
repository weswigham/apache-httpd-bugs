 Is your ServerRoot on a NFS mounted partition?  If so, do you have a
 LockFile directive putting the lockfile on a local disk?
 
 Are there any errors in the error log?

 Marc --
 
 ServerRoot and lock file are both on a NFS mounted partition.
 No errors of note in the error_log, no pattern to last entries in the
 access_log. Other notes: running in change root environment; tried both
 dynamic and static compilation. Thanks.

 Then move the lock file to a local disk as the docs for the LockFile
 directive say.  File locking over NFS isn't.
