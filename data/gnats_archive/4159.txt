>Environment:
irix 6.5.2 binary downloaded on 3/26/99 from ftp.apache.org to our irix 6.5.3

>Description:
1. switched from csh to sh
2. executed install-bindist.sh using this syntax

    ella% ./install-bindist.sh /usr/local/lib/www/apache_1.3.6

3. after completion, no errors, i went to 

   ella% cd /usr/local/lib/www/apache_1.3.6/bin and did this:

   grep -i '/usr/local/apache' 
apxs:my $CFG_PREFIX        = '/usr/local/apache';  # substituted via APACI install

i expected to see
apxs:my $CFG_PREFIX        = '/usr/local/lib/www/apache_1.3.6
