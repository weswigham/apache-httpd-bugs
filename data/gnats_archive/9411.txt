>Description:
The documentation for mod_rewrite says "This module operates on the full URLs", and the URL rewriting guide has a sample reverse proxy with the following line:

RewriteRule    ^(http|ftp)://.*          -  [F]

This line purports to block proxy requests to the reverse proxy.  It does not.  It seems that mod_rewrite is actually using the request URI and not the URL.  Nothing will match this rule.  A request like

GET http://blah.com/index.html

will show up as

/index.html

in the rewrite rules, so the documented way of blocking proxy requests to reverse proxies is wrong.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Here is a work around, but I would say that either Apache's behavior should change to match the documentation, or the documentation should change to match Apache's behavior.  I don't know that Apache used to work as documented, because I recall testing this in the past, but it has been a few years since I last verified that mod_rewrite worked properly.

If you use 

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} "!^(GET|POST) /.*$"
RewriteRule .* - [F,L]

instead of

RewriteRule    ^(http|ftp)://.*          -  [F]

You get the behavior you want
