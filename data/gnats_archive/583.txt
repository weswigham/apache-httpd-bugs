>Environment:
SunOS rabies 5.5 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20 
GCC 2.7.2
>Description:
Our config consists of two VirtualHosts, one specific to one port & IP, the
other intended to catch requests on a different port on all IP's.  (like this:

  Listen 80
  Listen 1.2.3.4:8080
  <VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:8080> ... </VirtualHost>
  <VirtualHost _default_:80> ... </VirtualHost>

This works fine for requests using any of our multiple hostnames for this machine,
but a request to http://1.2.3.4/ (or even http:/1.2.3.4:80/) is served by the 
main server, not the second virtualhost.  Since we don't set a DocumentRoot
for the main server, and there is no htdocs dir in the ServerRoot directory,
an error gets logged to the error log, which is specified in the main server,
and inherited by the second virtual host (so I am assuming the main server is
logging the error based on it looking for htdocs in the ServerRoot.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try a configuration like I described above.

I'm having trouble reproducing this problem.  Does it still
occur with the 1.2 release?  If so can you send me your config
files?

Thanks

 This problem no longer occurs with 1.2.0 using the same configuration
 files as I used with 1.2b10.  Thanks for looking into it, though.
