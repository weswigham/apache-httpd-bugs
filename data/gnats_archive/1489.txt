>Environment:
NT Server 4.0 (german version) with Service Pack 3
>Description:
First I want to say that I've downloaded the Win32 binary from your site. Since
I don't have VC++ 5.0, I can't modify some #define's and compile Apache myself.

While I was trying to get Apache run as a service I noticed two problems.

1. I installed Apache not into a \Apache directory so I have to use the -d (or
the -f) parameter to start Apache. That works fine as long as I try to start it
from the commandline or from the service control panel where I can tell NT to
pass some commandline arguments to the service. To get the Apache service
running without the service control panel I add the commandline argument to the
ImagePath key of the service in the registry. This seemed to work. Apache
started fine, but takes all the CPU time writing into the error logfile that it
can't find the file /apache/conf/httpd.conf ... This looks very strange since it
writes this into the error logfile I've configured in the existing httpd.conf
file. Thus Apache knows where to look for the config files ... After I put
Apache into a directory \Apache and removed the -d option from the ImagePath it
worked fine.

2. I've also played a bit around with the StartServers directive. I set it to
0 and started Apache from the command line to test the modification. It worked.
So I then started Apache from the service control panel and it didn't start.
After I increased that value again to more than 0 it worked again ...
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Put Apache and it's config files into something else than \Apache.
Configure it, install it as service, and modify the ImagePath key of the
Apache service in the registry (adding the -d option) and start it.

2. Set the StartServers directive to 0 and try start the service.
>Fix:
1. I had to use "Apache -i -d c:/programme/Apache" to get Apache installed as
service. Just "Apache -i" didn't work (it claimed that I can't find the file
/apache/conf/httpd.conf"). Why not put the passed directory (or file when
using the -f option) into the registry when you also mention the -i option ?
If no -d or -f option was given you could just write the #define'd root
directory into the registry. Later, when the server is started, you could
read the(se) value(s) back in and don't need the command line options when
using apache as service.
Ok, it's very specific to Win32 but that are services also. And I guess you
have only to change code that is already very specific to Win32. I suggest you
put the values into HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Apache\Parameters.
You could create two keys there, maybe named ServerRoot and ConfigFile of type
REG_EXPAND_SZ (to allow environment variables) ... well, just my 2 cents.

2. Sorry, no idea

State-Changed-When: Sun Feb 15 07:50:56 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Yes, at the moment Apache does not run very well as
a service unless it is installed in \APACHE on
the system disk. This will be fixed in a later release 
(but not 1.3b5).

I've suspended this PR so that we can update it when
fixes are made to Apache.

For now, it is best to run Apache from \Apache.
After installing the binary distribution of Apache, move
\Program Files\Apache to \Apache.
(remember to uninstall the Apache service with
\Apache\apache -u and reinstall it with \apache\apache -i
to update the services database with the new location
of the Apache executable).
