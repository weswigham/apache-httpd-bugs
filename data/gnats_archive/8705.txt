>Release:        1.3.22
>Organization:
>Environment:
OS:  HP-UX 11.0, 10.20
Patch Level: latest
Compiler: Tried gcc 2.8.1 and gcc 2.9.5
Apache Version: up to 1.3.22
Uname -a:  HP-UX fsce02 B.11.00 A 9000/800 76224 two-user license
>Description:
I have compile 3 different version of apache 1.3.1, 1.3.20, and 1.3.22 with to different version of gcc 2.8.1 and gcc 2.9.5.  All create a defunct shared memory segment when started.

example:  

Note:  The capital "D" indicates that the segment is defunct, or that a segment has been deleted with proccesses still attached

# ipcs -pm
IPC status from /dev/kmem as of Wed Nov  7 14:57:20 2001
T      ID     KEY        MODE        OWNER     GROUP  CPID  LPID
Shared Memory:
...
m    5123 0x00000000 D-rw-------       web     psoft  3637  3637
...

# ps -fp 3637 
     UID   PID  PPID  C    STIME TTY       TIME COMMAND
    root  3637     1  0  Oct 29  ?         1:23 /opt/apache/sbin/httpd
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem is very easy to repeat.  Just compile apache with the standard directives and start the httpd daemon (apachectl start). I have reproduced it on a hp-ux 10.20 and 11.0 system.
>Fix:
A shared memory segment is defunct when the associated shared memory segment has been removed, however there are processes still attached to it.  You can probably fix it by detaching all the proccesses from the segment before deleting it.

State-Changed-When: Sun Nov 11 11:47:49 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
I don't see any bug here.  Yes, Apache deletes the shared memory segment after creating and attaching to it to make sure it is cleaned up.  The semantics for doing this are well defined by the appropriate APIs and it is a perfectly legitimate thing to do.

 It doesn't attach to it to verify it is cleaned up, it deletes it
 immediately to ensure it is cleaned up.
 
 It is still using the shared memory segment.  Deleting it simply makes
 sure it will be removed when it isn't using it.
