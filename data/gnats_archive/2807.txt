>Description:
I am probably ignorant regarding this capability, but I am lead to belive (from
the documents and books I've read) that setting up an anonymous ftp server and 
accessing the server site using ftp://(site)/(filename) would cause the file to 
be downloaded as opposed to being read by the browser.

Is this correct assumption?

If so, what am I missing in my setup? 

If not, why even have ftp:// if it is the same as http:// ???

Thanks for any info.

>Fix:
Is it possible to set a general mime type for all elements in a directory...
aka. application/ftp ?

State-Changed-Why:
Apache is not a FTP server, it is a HTTP server.  You
need a FTP server to download things via FTP; the client can
decide to do whatever it wants with a file.
