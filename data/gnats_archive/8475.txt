>Description:
When posting a request that contains a Content-Length (even if it is 0) the first call to WSARecv return the correct buffer.  The second call waits and eventually times out with this stack:

apr_recv(apr_socket_t * 0x007e6cb0, char * 0x0081d790, unsigned int * 0x1086de48) line 110
socket_read(apr_bucket * 0x0081d728, const char * * 0x1086de54, unsigned int * 0x1086de48, int 0) line 75 + 18 bytes
core_input_filter(ap_filter_t * 0x007e6f78, apr_bucket_brigade * 0x007ef598, int 0, __int64 * 0x1086de8c) line 2883 + 25 bytes
ap_get_brigade(ap_filter_t * 0x007e6f78, apr_bucket_brigade * 0x007ef598, int 0, __int64 * 0x1086de8c) line 250 + 24 bytes
ap_getline(char * 0x1086dee0, int 8192, request_rec * 0x007eee10, int 0) line 224 + 25 bytes
read_request_line(request_rec * 0x007eee10) line 401 + 23 bytes
ap_read_request(conn_rec * 0x007e6d68) line 588 + 9 bytes
ap_process_http_connection(conn_rec * 0x007e6d68) line 283 + 9 bytes
ap_run_process_connection(conn_rec * 0x007e6d68) line 82 + 78 bytes
ap_process_connection(conn_rec * 0x007e6d68) line 221
worker_main(int 248) line 907
_threadstartex(void * 0x0081d500) line 212 + 13 bytes
KERNEL32! 77e8758a()

Tried with various verbs "GET", "POST", "PROPFIND"
>How-To-Repeat:
Request any URL (even non-existent) with a Content-Length header.  E.g., add this to index.html:

<form action="http://localhost:8080/index.html" method="post">
<input type="text"></input>
<input type="submit"></input>
</form>
>Fix:
Don't understand the code well enough yet.
