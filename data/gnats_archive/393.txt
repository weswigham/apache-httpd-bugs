>Description:
When FancyIndexing is turned on, the server outputs an <IMG...> tag before
every directory item, but it doesn't specify the size of this icon.

This is very irritating if the requested directory contains many (100+)
different files and the fetching of one (or more) icon stalls.

The current behavior causes:
a) If the browser-server link is slow and/or the icon-fetch stalls
   the browser does not display the index, it waits for the icons to load.
b) If the user turns off the automatic loading of images in the browser,
   the directory index is displayed while it's loaded, but the browser's
   (builtin) default image is much bigger than necessary. This limits
   the number of files displayed on one page significantly.
>How-To-Repeat:
Browse any directory with many files and no 'index.html' (eg. a site which gives 
HTTP access to FTP space; like some sunsite mirrors).
The site's icons should NOT be in the browsers cache initially.
>Fix:
The following patch adds a new parameter to IndexOptions - IconsHaveSize.
When IconsHaveSize is set (eg. 'IndexOptions FancyIndexing IconsHaveSize')
the server outputs:

<IMG SRC="/icons/back.gif" ALT="[DIR]" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="22"> <A HREF="/">Parent Directory</A>...

instead of:

<IMG SRC="/icons/back.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A HREF="/">Parent Directory</A>...

The width and size values are currently hardwired as determining them in
real time would be inefficient. However ICONSIZE could be a function, maybe
taking the values from a configuration file.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the patch, it looks good.  I'll put it on the
list of "contrib" stuff that we're planning to assemble for
1.2 release.  Unfortunately since 1.2 is in feature freeze
right now we can't add it directly.

Thanks

Comment-Added:
Two new keywords, IconHeight and IconWidth, have been added
to the IndexOptions directive for a future release of
Apache.  If not specified with values, the default Apache
icon dimensions will be used in the HEIGHT and WIDTH
attributes.  Specific values can be given, however, if
a different icon set is in use.

Thank you for using Apache!
