WinNT 4.0 [de] SP 4, VC++ 6.0 [de]
>Description:
The setup is the following:

.htaccess:
  Options +MultiViews
  AddType "text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" .html
  AddEncoding gzip .gz
  DefaultLanguage de

Files:
  /index.html
  /index.html.gz

----------
Request 1:

  HEAD /404/ HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.de

Response 1:

  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  Date: Thu, 03 Aug 2000 02:53:09 GMT
  Server: Apache/1.3.12
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
----------

This is ok, but when i now request '/index/' a wrong Vary Header is sent:

----------
Request 2:

  HEAD /index/ HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.de

Response 2:

  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  Date: Thu, 03 Aug 2000 02:54:08 GMT
  Server: Apache/1.3.12
  Vary: accept-language,accept-encoding
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
----------

This must be a bug since i do not have any ErrorDocuments defined.
