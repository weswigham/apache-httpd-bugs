State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure Apache is running?

Are you sure you have it installed to use the PID file
in the directory you give?  A PidFile directive or
changing your ServerRoot will change where it is located.

Are you sure you aren't running more than one copy of
Apache trying to use the same PID file?

 Apache is running-
 (1)In can obtain IP address for ppp log in by ftp a known site which logs
 me in and gives me my current address. Using another machine i can browse
 that url to
 get htdocs/index.html file. -server is up!
 (2)httpd.pid file is located where the kill call is sent.
 using fv- i have verified lcation of httpd.pid-in logs dir.
 (3) is there an easy way of getting the servers assigned address?(IP provider
 login address for session)

State-Changed-Why:
I'm sorry but we can't reproduce this problem.  You may also
wish to look at <http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#redhat>,
it may be relevant.  You may also wish to recompiled apache from
our distributed sources to ensure you've got the right code.
