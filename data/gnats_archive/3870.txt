>Description:
This is a bug that is fixed in JAVA-webserver 1.1.3

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4174974.html

It is to me not clear if it is a JSDK-bug or a bugg in jserv.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is my copy of the SessionServlet-example that comes with
JSDK:

http://mattias.kontakt.slu.se/servlets/SessionServlet

Go there and see that it works with session using cookies.
Then _CLOSE_ Netscpae and add this row to your cookies.txt file:
.slu.se	TRUE	/	FALSE	2051222400	SITESERVER	ID=f202122849dc7a9bc2e4f6d6848f05f5

Start Netscape again and go back to :
http://mattias.kontakt.slu.se/servlets/SessionServlet
Now only URL rewriting works, and not session using cookies!

_CLOSE_ Netscpae again and edit the row in cookies.txt to:
.slu.se	TRUE	/	FALSE	2051222400	SITESERVER	ID-f202122849dc7a9bc2e4f6d6848f05f5

Note       
ID=f202122849dc7a9bc2e4f6d6848f05f5 is changed to 
ID-f202122849dc7a9bc2e4f6d6848f05f5
         
Go back to the SessionServlet. Now sessions using cookies works again.
The .slu.se-cookie is not set by my server. And I have no idea who sets
that cookie.
