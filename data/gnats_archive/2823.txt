Linux dragon.*.com 2.0.31 #1 Sun Nov 9 21:45:23 EST 1997 i586 unknown
Server version: Apache/1.3.0 (Unix)
Server built:   Aug 10 1998 12:56:17

>Description:
I have been running 1.3.0 for about two months without a problem, now all of a sudden, it is acting funny.  I have tried everything I know, and am out of ideas.  The httpd server runs fine, but one or two of the httpd spawn processes will start to consume memory.  This causes the load on the server to sky rocket.  I have some safe guards set to shut httpd when the load gets to high, and then turn it back on when the load gets low enough, but this is happening every 5 minutes.  I have been able to confirm that it has something to do with one virtual site on the server.  I have turned everything off (mSQLd, sendmail, perl) and still it happens. Another guy I know showed me a latest apache exploit that had something to do with the httpd_protocol.c file, but he applied the patch for it, and the problem still exists.  Because the site is so busy, I was using some of the settings from the High Performance file:
MaxClients 25
StartServers 5
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 10
MaxRequestsPerChild 10000000
Here is a line from top that shows the problem:
10023 nobody     8 -20 19084  11M   352 R <     0  6.8 12.6   1:46 httpd
I have it niced to -20 so I can still use the server while it is over flowing the system and shut it down
Any ideas?

 Is there anything in the error log?
 
 Do you have any extra modules compiled in?
 
 Can you find anything in the access log that looks unusual?

 Exactly what patch is this?  Are you sure it was applied
 correctly and you are running the new binary?

 Does it continue to grow, or does it stabalize at a particular
 size?

 Nothing unusual.  A lot of:
 " [error] request failed for *.*.*.*: error reading the headers"
 Where the *.*.*.* seems to be different IP Addresses.

 Just rewrite, which did remind me that I did add some new rewrite stuff
 the day this started happening.  I have had problems with rewrite before,
 so I have removed the new code to see what happens.

 A lot of 400 return codes, but they are spread out over other IP space.

 To be honest I am not sure, my friend put it in.  Here is some of the code
 I know he implemented:
         if(++nheaders >=10) {
             r->status = HTTP_BAD_REQUEST;
             return;
         }
 He said something about a "bug" that was found in all versions of apache
 where you could cause httpd to get really huge be sending it a bunch of
 headers.

 They continue to grow until my safe guard kicks in and shuts httpd off.  I
 can also kill the offending process with no problem.
 
 Thanks for you help, if you have any ideas I would appreciate it.  I will
 keep an eye on the processes now that I have removed the rewrite code and
 I will let you know if that seems to fix it.
 Thanks
 Kevin

 It looks like it was the ReWrite causing the problems.  I had code in a
 linked .htaccess file that I have sprinkled in each directory (I know this
 could be done a better way, just have not got their yet).  Anyway that
 seemed to cause the problem.
 Thanks!
