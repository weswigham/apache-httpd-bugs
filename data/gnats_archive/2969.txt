>Description:

  Hello,

  Just the following comment: on my OSF1/V.3.2 the -msym option is unknown.
>How-To-Repeat:
Testing compilation on such system, if you have one.
>Fix:
Either change the src/Configure file to remove -msym if OSF1 version is 3.2, or
suggest to use, if ld complains on this system:

  setenv LDFLAGS_SHLIB "-shared -expect_unresolved '*' -s"

I've done it and it compiles then perfectly.

There is *nothing* critical, really nothing, in this report.

Thanks a lot.

State-Changed-Why:
We've now for Apache 1.3.2 removed the -msym option 
at all for OSF1 because it's only a little DSO
startup time optimization which is not really
important.
