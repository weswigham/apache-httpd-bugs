Windows 2000 professional service pack 1
java jre 1.3
>Description:
I wrote a servlet that absolutely needs to dispose of its resources before shuttind down. I used the "destroy" servlet method to do this. but it looks like JServ does not call the method before shutting down or JServ is not shut down when Apache is shut down...
I start Apache by using apache -k start
and I stop it by using apache -k shutdown
