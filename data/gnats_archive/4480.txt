State-Changed-Why:
I cannot recreate this problem. ap_make_table is nowhere
near index 8 in 1.3.6 (it's index 144 I believe). 

Did you install 1.3.6 ontop of an earlier version running 
on your server? Are you dynamically loading any modules 
not included with the distribution?

 I was trying to run Apache 1.3.6 with Websphere 2.02, but I found out that
 Websphere does not work with Apache 1.3.6.  Thanks for your help anyways.
