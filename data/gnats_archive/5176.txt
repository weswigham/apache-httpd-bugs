>Description:
We have two httpd daemons running. One listens to port 80 and other to 81

When i want to access the second server at port 81, I have to say
www.abc.com:81. But I don't want the port number to be a part of my url ie www.abc.com
should  automatically goes to prot 81.

How to do this?

State-Changed-Why:
This has nothing to do with Apache and is a very general
question about how the web works.  The Apache bug report
database is _NOT_ the proper place to be asking such questions,
as we make clear before you submit a report.
