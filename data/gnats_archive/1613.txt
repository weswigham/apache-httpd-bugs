 Try setting CC=gcc.

 Oh interesting.
 
 Well it looks like it's complaining about this:
 
 static void __attribute__((noreturn)) clean_child_exit(int code)
 
 Given that is valid gcc I'm not sure what to do.  Perhaps their default cc
 insists on adding -pedantic or -ansi to the command lines, yet still
 defines macros like __GNUC__.  In which case I would say it is broken.
 You're going to have to do a little legwork I think to help figure this
 one out.  The specific definitions in main/conf.h that check gcc look like
 this:
 
 /* So that we can use inline on some critical functions, and use
  * GNUC attributes (such as to get -Wall warnings for printf-like
  * functions).  Only do this in gcc 2.7 or later ... it may work
  * on earlier stuff, but why chance it.
  */
 #if !defined(__GNUC__) || __GNUC__ < 2 || __GNUC_MINOR__ < 7
 #define ap_inline
 #define __attribute__(__x)
 #else
 #define ap_inline __inline__
 #define USE_GNU_INLINE
 #endif

 I modified conf.h
 I got rid of the if/else and left
 
 #define ap_inline
 #define __attribute__(__x)
 
 Now I'm just getting the same compile error as on NeXT Mach 3.3 (os-
 next/1614)
 
 Thanks

 Well that to me indicates that the gcc shipped in cc clothing on next is
 completely broken.  Can you do this:
 
 touch aaa.c
 gcc -E -dM aaa.c
 
 And send me the output?
 
 And maybe also send me the contents of the specs file mentioned when you
 run "gcc -v".
 
 Thanks

 Wow, that's completely different from any gcc I've ever used, well at
 least for all the 2.7 and later versions (on linux, solaris, and IRIX).  I
 get stuff like this:
 
 % gcc -E -dM aaa.c
 #define __linux__ 1
 #define linux 1
 #define __i386__ 1
 #define __i386 1
 #define __GNUC_MINOR__ 7
 #define i386 1
 #define __unix 1
 #define __unix__ 1
 #define __GNUC__ 2
 #define __linux 1
 #define __ELF__ 1
 #define unix 1

 This looks like NeXT has really done a lot of crud to gcc to make it
 behave like something else, I'm not sure what.  They've done it in a way
 that I'm not sure how to detect -- in particular I'm concerned that if we
 were to put a test for NEXT into that section of conf.h we'd screw the
 people who have built their own gcc for next.  But I suppose we have to do
 that. 
 
 Hmm.

A tweak has been committed to 1.3b4-dev... hopefully NeXT will
