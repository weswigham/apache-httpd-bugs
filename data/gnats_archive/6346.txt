>Description:
things work fine under 1.3.6   

this config works fine.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteLog "/usr/local/apache/logs/REWRITE_log"
RewriteLogLevel 0
ProxyRequests On
NoCache *

RewriteRule (http:\/\/www\.apache\.com(.*))  http://www.yahoo.com$2 [P]
>How-To-Repeat:
try the above under 1.3.12   
i build both servers the same way
./configure --enable-module=proxy --enable-module=rewrite
>Fix:
it seems that the rewrite engine never get's called using this config under 1.3.12  

if i remove: 
ProxyRequests On
NoCache *

the rewrite engine is envoked but $_ (i'm thinking perl) is now an URI and not an URL the match will always fail.

is there anything i can do to get this working under 1.3.12?
i've read all the docs and install files.  i've moved around the module install order and nothing seems to work.   i'll probably just stick with 1.3.6 for now.

no clue on how to fix it!  :)
