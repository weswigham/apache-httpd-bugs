Comment-Added:

ApacheMonitorVersion.rc is a generated resource.  Unfortuantely,
the cygwin port is not based on the native API but the cygwin
layer, so we [both win32 and cygwin coders] have paid 
insufficient attention to building versioned .dll/.so files
and the native win32/ tree in cygwin.

It's a generated file, you can see 'how' it's generated in
the support/win32/ApacheMonitor.dsp ... really simple awk.
Probably trivial to get a cygwin-specific Makefile.in for
that tree.  Patches can be attached to this incident.

Thanks for participating in the Apache 2.0 Beta!
