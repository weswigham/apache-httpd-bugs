Slackware 8.0 with kernel 2.4.5
>Description:
When i config a virtual host and listen a port on the same machine. Then default page will not work. Seem to no default page.
Here is my config file demo.

Port 80
DocumentRoot /var/www/htdocs
.......

Listen 8000
<VirtualHost _default_:8000>
DocumentRoot /var/www/virtual.com
ServerName www.virtual.com
</VirtualHost>

When i start the apache 1.3.23 server with this virtual host. Then the defult server on port 80 will stop. The problem seem to set a wrong path with the DocumentRoot.

To slove this problem, i need to change the default port from 80 to other port.
And make two Virtual host, one is on port 80 another is on port 8000.

I don't know why this problem will happen, simce my other machine running RedHat 7.0 with the old Apache server without this problem.

State-Changed-Why:

I think your problem will be fixed by adding
Listen 80
to the config file.

But in any case, this is not a bug report, but rather
a configuration question.  It should be addressed to
a user support forum.  Check the FAQ for details.

Thanks for using Apache.
