AIX 4.2, IBM compiler
apache 1.3.6 + fastcgi (for apache 1.3.*), used with apaci
>Description:
I get this error message when running "apachectl configtest".
full text includes access.conf + line number, complete line IS "</Directory>".
nothing else to see, no special characters.

compile is successfull, make install ok.

commenting whole section: same error on next </Directory>.
