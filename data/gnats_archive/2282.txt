SunOS leeor.math.technion.ac.il 5.6 Generic sun4m sparc
gcc version 2.7.2.3.f.1
>Description:
If you use ISO-8859-1 Characters in the description field of a AddDescription
command, and I mean use the 8-bit, one byte, characters themselves rather than
using entities names, eithet numeric or symbolic,  then certain characters are 
transmitted as spaces for charaters with decimal code starting at
243 (small o, acute accent), namely, 243, 244, 245, 246, 250 and 253.
Characters with code 242 and below, and HTML entities, are treated correctly.
The problem doesnot arise for the code entered via the HEADER file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try http://www.math.technion.ac.il/~rl/JulesVerne/margot/test/
.htaccess and HEADER are copies (links) of the file TEXT so you can view 
them. Note that the descriptions of the files x243x,x244x,x245x,x246x,x250x,x253x
have a space for the last character intead of the correct 8-bit character.
>Fix:
I haven't check the sources to find what is the origin of this strange behaviour

This doesn't happen on redhat 5.1... which leads me to think it's
a solaris library error.

Comment-Added:
Add "EXTRA_CFLAGS=-funsigned-char" to your Configuration and
reconfigure/rebuild.

Apache doesn't use isascii() to protect the isspace()/etc.
macros.
