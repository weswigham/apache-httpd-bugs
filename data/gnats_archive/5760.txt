>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Sequent DYNIX/ptx v4.5.1
>Description:
A change was put into v1.3.11 to get around a problem with configuration files
and editiors on OS/2. The text mode flag was used in fopen() in src/main/util.c.
This change should have been IFDEF OS/2 as the Unix specifications (posix, unix98)
do not provide for a type/mode of "t" for fopen() and not all Unix implementations
ignore "t" like the "b" flag.

Diff provided below against v1.3.12-dev, request it be applied before v1.3.12
is released.
