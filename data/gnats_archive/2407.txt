>Description:
ScriptAlias fails to handle uppercase URLs.

ScriptAlias /Foo/script.cgi d:/os2httpd/Foo/script.cgi.cmd is ignored for a URL such as /Foo/script.cgi,
whereas ScriptAlias /foo/script.cgi (in lowercase!) works for the URL in uppercase as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any URL with uppercase characters and the equivalent definition on ScriptAlias.
>Fix:
Do not translate the name to lowercase prior to matching the ScriptAlias rules.
