AIX 4.3.2  778 Megs RAM 
cc for apache and gcc for stronghold
>Description:
When I start apache on a particular box I get an immediate "Server Seems Busy" message -- even though no web traffic has been sent to it.

Searching the Apache web site, I only see one article referencing low swap space.  I checked that out and it has only used 1% of 512 Meg.
All parameters for the server match its webfarm members exactly.

The apache configs are also the same:
StartServers 10
MaxClients 150
MinSpareServers 20
MaxSpareServers 50
MaxRequestsPerChild 1000

What does the message "server seems busy" upon startup when no traffic has yet been sent ?

I assume it may be hardware related ??  Where should I begin to look ?
vmstat, lsps, etc all register normal.

(This message also appears on the stronghold startup on that box)

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... what is the _EXACT_ message you are getting?

It could be partly because you have MinSpareServers > StartServers,
which makes little sense; you only start x servers, but you
require more than x to be running at all times.

The exact text of the error message is very important because
it says exactly why it is deciding to print the message.
