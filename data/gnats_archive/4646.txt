>Description:
From error_log:

   [DATE] [warn] [CLIENT] handler "action-XXXX" not found for: /full/path/to/file
   //12/usr/apache/httpd terminated (SIGSEGV) at 0007:00054E3F.
   [DATE] [notice] chile PID ##### exit signal Segmentation fault (11)

From Client-side you see, "Document contains no data."

===============================================================================

Here's the situation, I have a cgi-bin dir that contains a .htaccess file.
Consequently, *ALL* of my cgi scripts are authenticated (this is a MUST).
My Actions that the handlers call also live under the cgi-bin directory.
If I use the httpd.auth for my config, the authentication works, but I get the
above errors for the handlers.  If I use httpd.act for my config, the 
handlers work, but the authentication doesn't.  I've tried moving the handlers
out of the cgi-bin directory and into a dir that allows ExecCGI, but that didn't
work either.

One thing to note is that I had this working fine with Apache 1.1b2 with
the old httpd.conf/srm.conf/access.conf triumvirate.  I *thought* that I
had merged them into the single httpd.conf file without error, but there
may be some "extra" stuff in the new httpd.conf-dist that is messing me up.
My original conf files for 1.1b2 are available upon request.

>How-To-Repeat:
Use my conf files that I included in the full description above.
>Fix:
Tweaking the conf file might do it, but I haven't been able to crack the code.
Could be a bug, but I seriously doubt it as it would seem to have been a 
*HUGE* oversight if it was.
