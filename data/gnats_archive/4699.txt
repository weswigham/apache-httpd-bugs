>Description:
There seems to be some duplication between REALMAIN and 
standalone_main/master_main, among others:  Calls to ap_read_config,
ap_open_logs, ap_set_version and ap_init_modules.  Or are they meant to be
called twice each?  I don't see why.
This does not seem to be causing problems per se right now, except perhaps,
at worst, some lost memory.

Remove duplicate calls (duh)

 	Additionally, in process_request_internal, location_walk() is called
 twice, once before and once after the uri translation handler.  This seems 
 a little odd as well.  . SNF .
 
 Steve 'Nephtes' Freeland | "I'm happy," he said, and probably
 nephtes@hasc.com         | even believed it.

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, these things are supposed to be called twice.  There
is even a comment saying "yes this is called twice".

As for the location_walk being called twice, that too has
a comment; in this case, it even describes why...
