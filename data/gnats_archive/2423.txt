>Description:
I have install apache 1.25 before , the ssi function worked.

when I installed version 1.3 today, using formal httpd.conf ,srm.conf & access.conf, no ssi function worked. I have checked the error_log, no tracelog canbe  found there.
I use the following statment in my homepage:
<!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"-->
<!--#exec cgi="counter.cgi"-->
 I am puzzled. I wonder if I miscompile some modules, but I followed the instructions you provided, execute ./configure to produce Makefile,
then make it automatically.

I have check the entry XBitHack on and
Make the AddHandeler server-parsed .shtml

Do you have some recommandations?
>How-To-Repeat:
I have no access to internet , just in our  internal lan.
>Fix:
may be  I miscompiled some modules ,I don't know...

State-Changed-Why:
I don't think it will make any difference, but put a space
before the SSI closure - that is, change

  <!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"-->
to
  <!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED" -->

This is recommended practice in general.

What do you see when you go to the SSI-enhanced page?
Any "[an error occurred...]" messages, or are the SSIs
just being ignored.  What do you see if you View Source
of the rendered page?  If the viewed source includes the
raw SSI directives, the page is definitely not getting
parsed.  What happens if you go explicitly to the page
(i.e., to "/index.shtml") rather than just to the directory
object (i.e., "/")?  Does your DirectoryIndex line include
"index.shtml" as one of the files to try?
