>Description:
Ok, this is a bizzare one... First let me explain my environment. I have an ISP that hosts a domain for me (whtech.com) and I have an _internal_ (not accessable from the outside) server that I use for testing. The internal server is test.whtech.com, the external one, www.whtech.com... I have BIND running internally for DNS lookups, including both the internal and external servers (both on different IP ranges, etc... the internal one is in private addressing). When I activate the proxy service, and add it to my browser configuration, and go to test.whtech.com (the internal server) everything works great, however, when I go to the external server (www.whtech.com) I get re-directed to the ROOT web of my ISP, not my virtual host. My ISP is runnning Linux, w/ apache 1.2.6. I have verified that this problem exists when using both IE4 and NS4. As long as the proxy is not used, the external access is correct. Seems like maybe the proxy is not sending the headers correctly because it thinks that www.whtech.com is local? Who knows. We use the proxy service for blocking access to the general web during business hours to avoid lax employees surfing rather than working. PLEASE ask any questions you need to get clarification, I know this is a weird one. I don't know if this is duplicatable in earlier versions of apache, I did not activate Proxy until this week when 1.3 came out and I have allready de-installed 1.26

Another problem noted is with the root web server... it doesn't seem to work unless it is duplicated as a virtual site, when we used our old 1.2.6 config files on 1.3, it wouldn't allow access to the root server, but rather went to the first virtual one instead (they're all on the same IP). This is un-related to the proxy issue.

One other item... why can't I have soft or hard links in my path to my virtual server's root directory? It worked in 1.2.6, but I got an error in 1.3, so I had to un-ravel the directory path.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure you can unless you duplicate my setup. I'm happy to help you debug in any way I can.
>Fix:
Nope.

State-Changed-Why:
When you say you're running "1.3" do you mean "1.3.0" or
a beta version?

As for the symlinks issue:
It sounds as though you may be working from newly edited
copies of the .conf-dist files.  Look in your access.conf
for the "<Directory />" container, and change the
"Options None" to "Options FollowSymLinks".  See if that
fixes the link issue.  (In the future, please report only
one issue per PR; it's difficult to track multiples in
a single report..)

I have no suggestions for you on the proxy problem; someone
else on the team will probably address that with you.

 I am running 1.3.0, the released version. As for the sym links, I believe I
 do have that option enabled, but I will verify that just to be sure. If I
 still have an issue with the sym links, I will re-submit another bug report.
