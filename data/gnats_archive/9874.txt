 <H1>IS IT SAFE YET...</H1></CENTER>
 <H3>Now that Diasporans,* like Marian Jones - Oprah - Whitney - Michael Jordan - 
 						
 						
 						
 						
 Bill Cosby - Toni Morrison, are at the top of their game - winning competitions, 
 awards, recognition - practicing medicine, law, politics - hanging with 
 celebrities, power brokers and policy makers... Is it safe for Diasporans to 
 cooperate with the police...</H3>
 <H3>Everyone knows the risk Diasporans run in chance encounters with the police. 
 An attitude, A tone of voice, A gesture, A false move...can result in death. But 
 what about when Diasporans call the police?</H3>
 <H3>Demond Chatman called the police to report his mother's murder, and 
 that call cost him two years of his life - awaiting trial. And it just might 
 cost him the rest of his life - once his trial has ended.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Demond Chatman lived with his great-aunt, Bessie Hill, in Roxbury, 
 Massachusetts, a Diasporan community in Boston.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>On the morning of February 10, 2000, he told his great-aunt that he was 
 going to the park to exercise and he left the house. Later in the day his 
 great-aunt went out as well. According to Demond, when he returned he found his 
 mother's dead naked body in Bessie Hill's room, and he called the police.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Demond's mother, Mary Chatman, was killed by a single gun shot wound to 
 the back of the head. No one observed her arrival at Bessie Hill's house, there 
 were no witnesses to her murder, and the murder weapon was not found. According 
 to the police, Demond became a suspect because his relationship with his mother 
 was bitter, and her blood was found on the mattress, floor and wall in his room, 
 and there were traces of blood on a mop that was found at the crime scene.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>The prosecution's theory is that Demond killed his mother in his 
 bedroom and pretended to leave the house, when he was actually waiting for 
 Bessie Hill to go out so that he could get rid of the evidence. After his 
 great-aunt left the house, they contend that he dragged his mother's body to his 
 great-aunt's room where he tried, but failed to throw her body out of the 
 window. Then, according to the prosecution, he called the police because he 
 realized that he could not dispose of the body before Bessie Hill's foster 
 children came home.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>The Prosecution is prepared to ask a jury to believe that Demond 
 thought to dispose of the murder weapon, but that he did not think to distance 
 himself from the crime.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Fleeing the scene, to avoid being identified with a crime, is the 
 single most significant protection against being held responsible for a crime. 
 Fleeing the scene is a defensive move that even small children master, but 
 according to the prosecution, not Demond.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>I think Demond is innocent for several reasons. First, there's no 
 motive. Bitter is a subjective description of an abstract emotion. Presumably, 
 it is meant to infer that Demond did not like his mother... You don't kill your 
 mother simply because you don't like her. Also, the opportunity is 
 inconceivable. There's nothing to suggest that Demond invited his mother to his 
 house, or that he knew she was coming. So then, are we to think that he simply 
 shot her on sight... Which brings into consideration the manner in which she was 
 shot - in the back of the head. That type of shooting is generally the work of 
 one who is detached. It is a perfunctory approach to murder, and not the 
 confrontational approach that one would expect in a crime of passion. Most 
 significantly, he called the police. Only the criminal who has no choice calls 
 the police to the crime scene. Like in the murder of Bonnie Blake. Robert Blake 
 claimed that he left Bonnie in his car while he returned to the restaurant where 
 they dined, to look for something he left behind, and when he returned to the 
 car she was dead. He couldn't avoid calling the police because there were 
 witnesses who knew that the victim was with him, and he should have discovered 
 the body. Whereas, Demond could have simply avoided returning to his house until 
 someone else discovered his mother's body. Also, the police believe that Bessie 
 Hill was in the house when Demon's mother was shot, but there's no indication 
 that she heard the shot. Finally, Demond's background does not include violence 
 toward his mother, nor is there a general history of violence or criminal 
 activity, and the community, that knows him, believes in his innocence. 
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Demond's case represents an emerging pattern wherein Diasporans go to 
 the police to report a crimes - and end up in jail. A common feature in these 
 arrests is that the pivotal "facts" used to justify the arrest, are only known 
 to the police. In Demond’s case the police claim that his great-aunt told them 
 that he asked where the mop was before leaving the house, but his great-aunt 
 doesn’t confirm that, and it is highly unlikely that Demond did not know where 
 the mop was kept in his own house... Nevertheless, this "fact" was used by the 
 police to tie Demond to the crime, since, it is their theory that there was an 
 attempt to clean up the crime scene. In another case the police claimed that a 7 
 &amp; 8-year-old confessed to murdering and molesting a neighborhood girl. Only 
 the police heard the confession, and it was not recorded, nor was it repeated to 
 the children's parents. But despite the fact that it is doubtful that small 
 children, who have confessed to others, would refrain from confessing to their 
 parents, this "fact" was used to justify their arrest.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Several cases demonstrate that when Diasporans report crimes they’re 
 likely to be charged with the crime: A man who returned from work to finds his 
 wife dead in the bathtub, called the police and was jailed and charged with her 
 murder. Two boys, age 7 &amp; 8, were taken by their parents to the police 
 station, to report their observations concerning the murder and molestation of a 
 neighborhood girl, and they were taken into custody, and charged with the girl's 
 murder. A man who went to the police to report that he looks like, but is not, 
 the criminal depicted in a flyer, was jailed as the suspect. A police officer 
 who discovered his girlfriend's body in her apartment, called the police and was 
 jailed and charged with her murder.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>All, but one, of the people charged were ultimately exonerated, but not 
 before they were put in fear... in prison..., and in financial hardship for the 
 cost of their defense. Like Demond, there was no evidence against them, but the 
 legal standard for an arrest, "probable cause," was not applied, instead, the 
 emerging standard for Diasporans -" it is possible... " was applied. In effect, 
 Diasporans who are proximate to crimes are treated as suspects, unless they can 
 prove that they could not possibly have committed the crime, and there have been 
 cases when even that wasn't enough.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Which brings me to the most diabolic feature of the criminal justice 
 system, as it affects Diasporans, and that is that the system sometimes prefers 
 to destroy innocent Diasporans to arresting criminals. How else can you explain 
 focusing on a police officer, in good standing, with no history of violence, and 
 no criminal record, as a suspect, when the other choice is an ex-con with a 
 violent past. Or to settle on 7 &amp; 8-year-old boys, who were in good standing 
 in their school and community, for the molestation and murder of a girl who was 
 older and bigger than them. When the other choice is a man with a history of 
 molesting girls, whose DNA matched the DNA taken from the sperm found on the 
 victim.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>One might ask, what can be gained by imprisoning innocent people? And 
 the answer is preservation of the status quo. Racism is an ideology wherein the 
 value of people is deemed to be identifiable by their skin color. The highest 
 status is given to those with the lightest skin, and the lowest status is given 
 to those with the darkest skin. For many light complected people, the status 
 ascribed to their skin color is the only thing that they believe "positively" 
 defines them. I call it the "at least syndrom." No matter how inadequate, 
 unaccomplished, immoral the racist is, in his mind he is "at least," better than 
 all people who are darker than he is.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>In the days of slavery and segregation, the society supported racist 
 ideology by relegating dark skinned people to the unenviable status of slave and 
 social outcast. But with the end of slavery and segregation, many Diasporans 
 have achieved fame and fortune, creating tremendous psychic pressure on those 
 who are clinging to beliefs of superiority. For these people, the ability to 
 unjustly imprison Diasporans is to reclaim the power to assert superior status 
 through dominance. In such circumstances, the racist is acting out the status 
 that Chief Justice Taney succinctly described in the Dred Scott Decision, "A 
 black man has no rights which a white man is bound to respect." From this 
 perspective, it is understandable that racist oppression is oftentimes not 
 motivated by a desire to hurt Diasporans, but rather by a desire, on the part of 
 the racist, to assert his perceived status...
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>It has been said that those who don't know their history will relive 
 it. Many of us know the facts that make up our history, but we don’t know how it 
 relates to what we’re experiencing today. Our history is that we were physically 
 enslaved so that our personal resources were diverted to the benefit of others; 
 we were segregated and discriminated against so that our condition would support 
 others in maintaining a false belief about themselves. Finally, we were socially 
 isolated so that no one would help us. Today, some aspects of that social 
 isolation remains intact. It is perpetrated by manufactured differences that 
 separate us from others The code language is "they don't test like we do," they 
 get diseases that we don't" "they commit crimes that we don't," "their families 
 don't function like ours," all of which is to be translated in the hearts of men 
 to mean, "they’re not like us." Even our celebrities are denigrated. When white 
 celebrities are shown with untended tresses, it’s a bad hair day, but when it’s 
 Oprah, it’s described as "her real hair."
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Whitney Houston was relentlessly formed in the image of a drug addict, 
 when the only drug related facts are that a minuscule amount of marijuana was 
 found in her luggage at an airport, and she denied that she has a drug problem, 
 and a court ordered drug test determined that to be the truth... But the media 
 was not deterred. They continued to publish rumors and innuendos. Never using a 
 named source. Inferring that every incident in Whitney's life was drug related. 
 Ultimately convincing most people that Whitney has a drug problem. Which 
 demonstrates a tool of deception used by the media - repetition. If people hear 
 something often enough and long enough, they will begin to believe it. Another 
 media trick is to diminish public awareness of Diasporan achievements by only 
 mentioning compelling achievements, and understating those.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Highly achieved Diasporans like Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters, 
 were only brought to our attention after they ascended to a position of 
 dominance. Whereas other races are highlighted as they progress toward fame - 
 like several young golfers who haven't accomplished anything but are highlighted 
 for their potential. Another detracting media tactic is to include Diasporans in 
 negative reports that don’t apply to them.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>For example, Tyra Banks was included in a report on women who have 
 enhanced their breast - even though she has not enhanced her breast. The 
 publication did not say that she did, but including her in an article in which 
 everyone depicted enhanced their breast, would leads the average person to 
 conclude that Tyra enhanced her breast too. Serena Williams was included in a 
 report on addiction, and before the report, her name, in combination with the 
 word addiction, was repeated often, throughout the day. Consequently people were 
 hearing an announcement that Serena has an addiction, but they had to hear the 
 full report before they would known that the "addiction" was shopping on the 
 internet... It turns out that the media appropriated Serena’s use of the word 
 addiction, to describe her enjoyment of shopping on the internet, and misused it 
 to sabotage her clean cut image. By contrast, when reporting on Winona Rider, 
 who truly was arrested for shoplifting, a report described her as "a celebrity 
 who is alleged to have shoplifted," leaving her name out of the report...
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>In the spirit of this inclusion in all things negative, Lisa Bonnet was 
 one of the celebrities discussed on a show that highlights celebrity scandals. 
 The commentator's voice was rife with judgment as he recounted nudity in a 
 movie, the birth of a baby, and a divorce... to describe Lisa. The tone and 
 rhythm of the voice was so appropriate to a description of scandal until it 
 virtually overwhelmed the reality - namely, that what was described was not 
 scandalous. Nude scenes are common in movies, married people have babies, and 
 one in two people divorce... Where’s the scandal? But facts aren’t what the 
 media is after - they're after an impression. They know that by tucking 
 non-scandalous facts about Lisa Bonnet, in between real scandals about others, 
 and presenting it like it is scandalous, that they will impress on the passive 
 mind that Lisa Bonnet is scandalous.
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>Which relates back to our history. Slavery was not merely physical, it 
 was social and emotional too. Physical slavery ended with the Emancipation 
 Proclamation, and social slavery ended when segregation was outlawed, but 
 emotional slavery persists. Emotional slavery binds Diasporans by lies, 
 innuendos, insults and distortions to a false identity, that racist have come to 
 depend on for their own identity - namely, better than you... This is the 
 backdrop in which police arrest us with impunity, prosecutors bring charges 
 against us that lack merit; judges imprison us when we are not dangerous or 
 flight risks; and juries convict us without substantial evidence...
 <H3></H3>
 <H3></H3>So we are, in the words of Tolstoy, in "the best of times and the worst 
 of times." We can achieve anything that we set our hearts, minds and 
 imaginations to, but we can also spend undeserved time in jail. In these times 
 of Diasporan successes like Marian Jones, Oprah, Whitney, Michael Jordan, Bill 
 Cosby, Toni Morrison; the increase in the arrest of Diasporan women is more than 
 800%, and about one in three young Diasporan men is under criminal justice 
 supervision. So, when trouble comes, go ahead, call the police, but not before 
 you call your lawyer...

 <H3><FONT color=#990000>WHAT ABOUT YOUR HAIR...</FONT></H3></CENTER>
 </H3><h4>Our social situation is complex, and so is our hair. In a world of 
 straight hair, curly hair is a challenge. And in a world that caters to straight 
 hair, curly hair is neglected. Our sponsor, <A>HJ Enterprises<A>, delved into 
 the complexities of curly hair and developed <A><FONT COLOR=blue>The Hair Kit</font><A>, a hair care 
 system that revolutionizes the curly hair experience. The creator of this system 
 recognized that curls, even tight curls, are not the reason for breakage, 
 dryness and combing difficulties. This insight came from studying the phenomena 
 of relaxed hair "going back."<BR><BR>The creator of <A><FONT COLOR=blue>The Hair Kit</font><A> reasoned that 
 since relaxed hair reverts back to the original curl pattern after exposure to 
 water, even though it is the product of permanently broken curl forming bonds, 
 there must be something besides the curl that affects the shape of curly hair. 
 That something is the hair's structure, chemistry and moisture content. The 
 structure of curly hair is a myriad of airpockets, the chemistry is acidic and 
 the moisture content is sparse. The hair's airpockets must be expanded or 
 sealed, to smooth the hair's cuticle, and the pH must be acidic and the moisture 
 content increased, to prevent frizzing.<BR><BR> Relaxers change the structure of the 
 hair, but they don't accommodate the hair's chemistry and moisture requirements, 
 nor do traditional products. Without proper pH and moisture content, the 
 airpockets in curly hair shut down, causing the hair to draw up and become dry, 
 brittle and difficult to comb. This is true, regardless of whether the hair is 
 natural or relaxed. <A><FONT COLOR=blue>The Hair Kit</font><A> is designed to work with the hair's 
 natural structure by filling the airpockets to achieve the hair's "optimum 
 shape," thereby eliminating dryness, shedding and styling difficulties.<A>The 
 Hair Kit<A> contains all natural products that mimic the hair's natural 
 moisturizer, sebum, and like sebum, it contains organic acid, fatty acids, 
 proteins, moisturizers and lubricants. These products interact with the hair and 
 scalp in the same way as sebum does - eliminating tack, while providing the 
 scalp with lasting moisture that corrects itching and flaking. <A>The Hair 
 Kit<A> makes curly hair vibrant to look at and luxurious to touch.</h4>
