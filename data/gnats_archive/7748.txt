 Now May 2001 - Don’t let depression get you down!
 
 Western experts now agree and say that products high in saturated fats,
 such as red meat and process3ed food, use up large amounts of energy to
 digest and restrict the flow of oxygen to the brain.
 
 As a result we feel low.
 
 Remedies
 
 1.	Take a breath of pure oxygen
 2.	Nutritionist Vicki Edgson foods that make you feel better are those
 that are high in Omega 3, like flax seed oil.
