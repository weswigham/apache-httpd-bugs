>Description:
If the BrowserMatch line advised for getting round the MSIE 4/Java/HTTP 1.1 bug fails on a Browser match (not specific to MSIE - one can change the string to get the same effect on Lynx), there is a 500 error with the following in the log file:

downgrade-1.0=1: is not an identifier
[Tue Dec 16 17:25:47 1997] access to /usr/bts/wrm/cgi-bin/wrm/repdefinition failed for columbine.bts.co.uk, reason: Premature end of script headers
>How-To-Repeat:
Access /cgi-bin/test-cgi  (NCSA one) after having applied the MSIE 4 workaround and with your browser string set to match the browser used.
>Fix:
Experiments indicate that bash will accept:

export fred=jim

but /bin/sh fails thus:

$ export fred=jim
fred=jim: is not an identifier
$

I'd therefore surmise that Apache is assuming an extension in the shell language. (Also, the string is obviously in /bin/sh, as confirmed by strings, but not in apache).

Unfortunately the logistics of rebuilding Apache are a bit fraught (it has to be sent to another office, who have the TCP/IP development kit) and for marketing (not technical) reasons, Netscape server is being used in the system to be sold, so actually testing this is outside my budget (I can work round it by disabling HTTP/1.1 in MSIE)

 This is a known problem (thought there was another PR about it... can't
 find it right now) related to the use of a "-" in a variable name.  Some
 shells do not accept that.  It needs to be changed in the Apache code.  A
 temporary workaround would be to use a replacement shell that supports it
 (eg. bash), however this can only be changed by recompiling Apache with
 the SHELL_PATH define changed.

 This is the last one I tried on MSIE 4; I cut out one variable 
 because it wasn't documented except in the MSIE 4/ Java workaround 
 and I thought Apache was rejecting it at the time:
 
 BrowserMatch "MSIE 4\.0" force-response-1.0
 
 I also tried:
 
 BrowserMatch "Lynx" force-response-1.0

 This seems sufficient but not necessary.  SCO /bin/sh certainly 
 doesn't parse variables with a - properly, but the error message 
 observed can only be generated by using export, whereas the - would 
 have produced an error on the assignment as well.
 
 
 # fred-1=jim
 fred-1=jim: not found
 # 'fred-1'=jim
 fred-1=jim: not found
 # export fred-1
 fred-1: is not an identifier
 # export fred
 # fred-1=jim /bin/echo
 fred-1=jim: not found
 # export fred-1=jim
 fred-1=jim: is not an identifier
 # fred=jim
 #
  
 
 As I indicated in the original report, marketing considerations that 
 are outside the hands of a mere programmer, mean that the system sold 
 will use SCO Fast Start and its included Netscape; I was using Apache 
 for testing on the older SCO we had in this office, although 
 personally I see no technical advantage in Netscape (the application 
 is so CGI intensive that threads offer no advantage).  As such, I can 
 work round by configuring MSIE not to use HTTP 1.1.

Comment-Added:
Apache is neither setting the envariables through the
command line nor issuing the export commands; it sets
them through the exec[lv]e() calls.  The exporting must
be getting done by the shell at some point after it has
been started.

Will SCO's sh accept a dash if it's escaped?  E.g.,
"alpha\-omega=1"?

 I didn't follow this up further because our maketing people wouldn't 
 accept a free third party browser in the distributed product.  They 
 wanted the SCO supplied and supported Netscape product, so even 
 though Apache performs better we had to target for Fast Track!  We 
 moved from SCO 3.2v4.2 to SCO 3.2v5 for development, so we had Fast 
 Track and there was no excuse for using another server.
 
 For testing, we could disable HTTP 1.1 in MSIE 4.
