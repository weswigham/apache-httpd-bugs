Windows 2000 SP1
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
>Description:
This is a Windows-specific problem with makefile.win

When I try to build Apache using the supplied makefile.win file, it fails when it reaches the line
   cd srclib\sdbm

The Apache 2.0a9 source archive does not have this directory.

There is another problem later on, when "perl" is invoked to create the config files. A syntax error is encountered on line 10 when $_ is expanded. It appears that this is being expanded by NMAKE and not being passed through literally to Perl.
>How-To-Repeat:
Pick up the apache_2.0a9.tar.gz archive and extract it into a clean directory.
Run Developer Studio, open up the workspace Apache.dsw, and export makefiles for all projects.
Now, from a command shell, run "nmake /f makefile.win installr".
The invocation of nmake will fail at the line noted above.
>Fix:
Comment out the line "cd srclib\sdbm" and the two following, or else include the missing directory.
In the "perl" input script, change $_ to $$_
