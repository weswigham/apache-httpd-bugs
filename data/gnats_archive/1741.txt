State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 29 16:41:30 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Grumble.  This is caused by a silly interaction between
the client sending an non-standard header and the "server"
being hidden behind a proxy (ie. at Novell's end) that incorrectly tries to
listen to it.  This means that the server never closes
the connection, so the Apache proxy never finishes transmitting.

I'll put a workaround together when I get a chance.  Saying
exactly who is to blame is difficult because it is non-standard
headers causing the problem, but Apache can avoid the
problem by changing the non-standard header.

 FYI, this is the patch that was applied.  It isn't a bug in the Apache
 proxy, but a bug in Netscape's mind combined with Novell's world that make
 it not work.
