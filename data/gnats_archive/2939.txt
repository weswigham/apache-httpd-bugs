>Description:
In learning Perl, I placed a apache 1.26 server on or internet site.  My beginning Perl scripts had the basic "fill this out" and post it to a .txt file.
I then updated to 1.30, and had some reconfiguring to do because of the "virtual only"
config.  for some time I never used this function (the pages display fine).  When I wanted to 
update a perl script I tested an input and received the error "The requested method POST
is not allowed for the URL /cgi-bin/form1.pl"
>How-To-Repeat:
http://panther.bsat.com (placed on our net as a test)
the "Survey form"
also the search engine displays the perl script but does not run it.

>Fix:
have checked/modified paths, used alias setups, verified rights, worked with virtual hosts updates.
Probably a .conf error or change in 1.3 I can't fathom

 This almost certainly means you don't have the URL in question setup to be
 executed as a script.
 
 What does the error log show?
 
 What happens if you just try to load the script in your browser?  If it
 doesn't try to execute it, you haven't configured your server to execute
 scripts in that directory.  Check your ScriptAlias directive.

 Marc;
    Good morning!  We've been in the other building performing some miracles.  I have gotten the scripts to work using the manual kind of sideways.  Apparently
 setting the ScriptAlias in the srm.conf used to allow all virtual servers to use it.  The FAQ page says that ScriptAlias can appear in the server-conf, but
 "NOT" in the virtual host.
    First:  we updated to 1.31, recompiled and started with a base setting for the virtual pages.
    Then we ignored the srm.conf and set the ScriptAlias in the httpd.conf <virtualhost> section.
  The code then ran as expected.
      I reckon what tripped us up was that switching to a virtual-server environment needed several extra changes that were not documented clearly.  The manual
 is very good, but people switching from 1.2x to 1.3x might could use a "oh, by the way" section.
     I thank you for your quick answers, And I am sorry to have bothered you.
 
 Oh, I'm usually not this dumb, and I now owe someone a troubleshooting favor.
 
 Thanks....   Jeff
