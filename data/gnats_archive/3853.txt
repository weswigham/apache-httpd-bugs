State-Changed-Why:

Apache is not guaranteed to build in anything other than
an ANSI C compiler environment.  If g++ won't compile it,
that's too bad -- but getting it to work with C++ isn't
one of our goals, and definitely not a bug.

I have managed to almost create a running server. It is just one more
undefined symbol _eh_pc.

What I have done until now:

- changed K&R-style function definitions in regex
- changed some typedefs to struct names,
- changed module forward declarations to "extern"
- CHANGED VARIABLES NAMED "new" AND "this" TO OTHER NAMES!!!!!!
- the handler function definition with variable parameters gave an error.
So I declared :

#ifdef __cplusplus
typedef void * (* cmd_func) (cmd_parms *, ...);
#else
typedef void *(* cmd_func)();
#endif

in httpd_config.h and casted all occurences in the command handler tables.

There are LOTS of warnings about all sorts of missing casts left, and, as I 
said, it is still not working.
Besides, as I have traced through ALL the sources for doing this, I got
the impression that especially the module handling could be done much
clearer with some object classes, since the function pointer stuff does
quite the same as an abstract class. So just making g++ work will do
only 5% of the job.
