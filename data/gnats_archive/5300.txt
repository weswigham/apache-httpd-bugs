>Description:
When server side includes are enabled, I can enter additional junk
on the end of the URL, and Apache does not complain. This may not
really be an error, but somehow while Verity is spidering the site,
it gets caught in endless loops trying to insert URLs like:
http://www.server.com/index.html/IT/info/<other hrefs>
If I change my Option line in access.conf, and remove Includes, then
I get a page not found error, as I would expect, from Apache.

I thought I got rid of this problem when I disabled MultiViews,
but I guess not.

I cannot disable SSI since tons of our pages use it, but I can't
get Verity to work correctly either.

I would be very happy to receive any fixes, work arounds, 
comments, etc.

Please Help
Thanks,
Zoli
>How-To-Repeat:
To duplicate this, type in the following URL:
http://www.apache.org/index.html/foo/foo/foo/foo/
Then click on one of the relative links, like FAQ or Foundation
You will see that it will not make it to these URLs, but it will
accept them.

If you update the conf file, and remove the Include Option, this
same URL will not be allowed.
>Fix:
I guess, the mod_include code would need to verify that the full/entire path
is valid ?

State-Changed-Why:
That is correct, and the behaviour is that way on purpose.
There are lots of ways a spider can be too dumb for itself;
you can't prevent against stupidity.

There are numerous other PRs that explain the reasons for
the behaviour in more detail.

 Hi Marc,
 
 I didn't realize that I could do searches against each
 module in the PR database; I guess it was just too
 late
 on a Friday night ... I was trying to find the info
  doing free text searches. Sorry.
 
 I've searched through all of the PRs for mod_include,
 but did not find any answers/solutions. Personally, I
 don't like Verity all that much, but this problem is
 possibly related to user error, i.e. links like:
 http://server/index.html/
 Since the site I administer has 20000+ links, I can't
 catch everything. I don't think that it's Verity's 
 fault when the web server allows links like:
 http://server/index.html/foo/junk/junk/
 This doesn't work when SSIs are turned off. Shouldn't
 a ? be used to separate a path from path_info?
 
 I can't understand why there is a need for this, the
 standard server config, i.e. without SSIs doesn't
 allow
 this behavior.
 
 I don't see how a search engine can combat this, and I
 don't think that this can be blamed on Verity, or any
 standard spidering tools.
 
 Is there no work around for this ? I didn't see an
 explanation of why there would be a need for:
 http://server/index.html/foo/foo/
 instead of:
 http://server/index.html?/foo/foo/
 
 Thanks,
 Zoli

 I just realized that I incorrectly stated something
 in my previous note. Just to clarify:
 
 
 I don't understand why html pages would every require
 path info. If a URL:
 http://server/index.cgi/foo/foo/
 is used, this is fine, but if a URL:
 http://server/index.html/foo/foo/
 is used, why is this ever needed ?
 Would it make sense to check if the requested file is
 executable, and then make a decision on whether or not
 to return a page not found error ?
 
 I agree that I don't quite understand the need for
 this
 on regular html files, but I could not find any
 answers
 in the PR database. 
 
 Thanks

 Because "index.html" might be a PHP file, or use
 server-side includes, or otherwise be more than
 just a text file.
