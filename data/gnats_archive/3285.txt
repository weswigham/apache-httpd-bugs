>Description:
Sometimes apache reads config files from PREFIX/etc, other times from PREFIX/conf. I think this is caused by different assumptions made by the apaci configuration script and the manual configuration procedure in PREFIX/src. I got that impression from comparing the READMEs in the two locations, which describe different conventions... etc in one place, conf in the other.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compare the dox in the two locations re: etc vs conf
>Fix:
Settle on one or the other, or document why two conventions are useful.

State-Changed-Why:
The apci configure script uses completely differnet configuration
methods and directory layouts.  This is well documented.
If you want configure to use the same default locations as
Configure, simply give it the proper options.  Pick one method
or the other and use it.

Comment-Added:
Also, my understanding is the the --compat option to
the APACI configure script will use the Configure
directory structure.
This excert from INSTALL

     Use the --compat option to install Apache into a installation tree which
     has a similar layout than the one used with Apache 1.2.
