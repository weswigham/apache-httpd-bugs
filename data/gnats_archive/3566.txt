>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 5.2 i686
>Description:
Whenever I put more than one VirtualHost (Name) entries into the httpd.conf file then Apache does not restart. I have checked the FAQs, Bug Reports etc and have included a Vhost entry for the machine. All of the DNS records are in order.
>How-To-Repeat:
Copies of the httpd.conf and srm.conf can be found via anonymous ftp to moehau.realware.com.au. The hosts in question are www.ypv.com.au, www.pigsinspace.com.au & moehau.realware.com.au. At the moment the vhost settings have been removed so Apache is running - browse to moehau.realware.com.au or /pigs or /ypv
>Fix:
I had it running on the previous version (before NameVirtualHost).

 What do you mean with 'does not restart'? What exactly happens when you
 try to restart Apache? Are there any messages in your error log?
 
 Please append the relevant entries from your configuration to this
 problem report.

 The error log says nothing. If I use a SIGHUP then it simply states that
 the SIGHUP has been received and it is attempting to restart. If I make
 the httpd.conf changes for vhosts then reboot the server then no
 messages are written to the error log and Apache doesn't start.
