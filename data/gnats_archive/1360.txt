>Description:
We're currently facing the problem that certain initialization work can only be done in the child server processes. Because such kind of initialization can be very time consuming we want it to be  executed before the first request arrives in the handler.
To solve this problem we suggest to add an entry to the module table which would server as an 'init child hook'.

State-Changed-Why:
This is already present in the 1.3 tree.  From the
CHANGES file:

  *) API: Added child_init function to module structure.  This is called
     once per "heavy-weight process" before any requests are handled.
     See http_config.h for more details.  [Dean Gaudet]
