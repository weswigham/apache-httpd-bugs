Solaris x86 2.4, 2.5
HP-UX 10.20
>Description:
Adding additional directives (I choose %M for request method,
%V for request protocol, %A for PathInfo+CGIargs) I rewrite %r
as %M %U%A %V; for virtual hosts, I then set
LogFormat ... \"%M /%v%U%A %V\" ...: it is CLF-compatible and
it contain host information.
[I actually don't need %A and I have not implemented it]

Sorry for my poor english
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
log_request_method(request_rec *r, char *a) { return r->method ; }
log_request_protocol(request_rec *r, char *a) { return r->protocol ; %7
