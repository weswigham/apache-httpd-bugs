>Description:
 Due to requirements out of my control, I'm required to run Apache directly
 from a CDR.  I've had luck running Apache directly from a CDRW, but not a
 CDR.  I'm looking for a way to hard code the process identification number
 in the httpd.pid file.  Any suggest are much appreciated.
 
 Thank You.
 Mark

State-Changed-Why:

The only suggestion I have is to use a temp directory
or RAM disk to store the things that Apache needs to change.

By the way, this question should be directed to one
of the apache-related newsgroups as mentioned in the FAQ,
since it is not a bug report.
In addition, if you do wish to submit a bug report,
please use the web form and not the email address.

Thanks for using Apache!
