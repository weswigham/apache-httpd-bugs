>Description:
Okay, so in my srm.conf I have:
AddHandler log-viewer     .log
...
Action log-viewer     /cgi-bin/logview?

The ? seems to be necessary so that the file is passed as the query string.

But apache puts:

[Thu Jul 29 17:32:37 1999] [warn] [client 140.239.17.249] handler "log-viewer" not found for: /home/httpd/logs//error.log

Into the error.log

Probably because it's first checking to see if a file named "logview?" exists?

I know the handler is found because I get its output
(logview is just a sh script to do a tail -n25 on the file)
