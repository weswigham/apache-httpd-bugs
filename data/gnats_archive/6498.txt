Redhat 6.1, 2.2.12-2
>Description:
I'm using Apache to ProxyPass a Zope site:

#CacheRoot /Services/www/mysite/cache/
#CacheSize 40
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:7080/websites/mysite/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:7080/websites/mysite/

If those first two lines are commented it works fine.  However if I uncomment them,
at random pages are not totally loaded - the html is cut off in the middle, images do not load and stay white untill I refresh the page.  This happens in IE/Netscape on Windows and Linux.

Somehow turning on the caching breaks the output from Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Email me and I'll change the caching back on and you can see what the site returns.
