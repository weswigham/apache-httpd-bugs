>Description:
On installing Livesoftware's JRun for Apache, software for running servlets, I encountered this problem:

Syntax error on line 219 of C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load c:/program files/apache group/apache/modules/jrun_apache.dll into server:

LoadModule jrun_module modules/jrun_apache.dll

So I uncommented the other Loadmodule statements, which worked fine except for this one :
LoadModule proxy_module modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll

,which produced :

Syntax error on line 30 of C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE/modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll into server:
which is a known problem under W95.


Like the other dll's, both definitely are present and in the same directory.

Anyone know what's causing this ?

State-Changed-Why:
First, it is very useful if you say exactly what version
of Apache you are using.  "1.3" means nothing useful here.
"1.3.0" or "1.3.1" does.

The proxy module failure on win95 is a known issue and already
entered in another PR.  It only fails on 95, not 98
or NT.  The reason is unknown.

As to JRun, we really are unable to help you with it since
it isn't our module, we don't know what version of Apache
it was made for or what version you are using, etc.  Please
contact the module vendor for help.
