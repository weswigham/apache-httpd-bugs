>Description:
I have made a very basic installation of Apache using the following command

./configure --sysconfdir=/usr/var/www/conf \
	--logfiledir=/usr/var/log/httpd \
	--runtimedir=/usr/var/run \
	--datadir=/usr/var/www \
--enable-suexec \
--suexec-caller=www \
--suexec-userdir=/usr/var/www \
--suexec-uidmin=100 \
 --suexec-gidmin=85 \
--suexec-safepath="/bin:/usr/bin"

Prior to this, I have edit ../src/support/suexec.h my modifying the following line

/*
 * DOC_ROOT -- Define as the DocumentRoot set for Apache.  This
 *             will be the only hierarchy (aside from UserDirs)
 *             that can be used for suEXEC behavior.
 */
#ifndef DOC_ROOT
#define DOC_ROOT "/usr/var/www"
#endif                       

I know that apache loaded suexec when started as per following error_log entry

[Sat Nov  7 00:45:46 1998] [notice] Apache/1.3.3 (Unix) configured -- resuming n
ormal operations
[Sat Nov  7 00:45:46 1998] [notice] suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: /usr/loca
l/apache/sbin/suexec)

However, everytime I try to start a cgi (Count.cgi) in this case I get the same error messages
One error message in error_log
[Sat Nov  7 01:05:09 1998] [error] [client 206.75.114.41] Premature end of scrip
t headers: /usr/var/www/docs/cgi-bin/Count.cgi  

and one in suexec_log
[1998-11-07 01:05:09]: uid: (lcroteau/lcroteau) gid: (mall/mall) cmd: Count.cgi
[1998-11-07 01:05:09]: command not in docroot (/usr/var/www/docs/cgi-bin/Count.c
gi)     

My previous version of Apache (Server: Apache/1.2.4) works without any problem for suexec

Let me know if you would like any other information about my system.
>How-To-Repeat:
If you would like, I can reload 1.3.3 and run any scripts that would help you 
figure out the problem.  Just let me know what you would like.

State-Changed-Why:

If you configure with "--data-dir=/usr/var/www"
suexec is compiled with "/usr/var/www/htdocs" as
DOC_ROOT.
"--suexec_userdir" is only used for "/~user/..."
requests, but it looks like you are trying to use
suexec with virtual hosts.

In my opinion we should add a "--suexec-docroot"
switch to the configure script and not add
"htdocs" automatically to the datadir.

I'll take a closer look at this problem.
Thanks for your report.

State-Changed-Why:

Two new options (--suexec-docroot and --suexec-logfile)
have been added to APACI to allow full control of      
the suEXEC setup.
