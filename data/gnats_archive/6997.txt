>Description:
RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower
RewriteRule ^/([a-zA-Z]+)$    "${lowercase:$1}" [E=RRDEBUG:$1,R,L]

The $1 backref in ${lowercase:$1} is not expanded before passing to the tolower rewritemap func, instead tolower is called first and then an expansion is done. This worked the opposite 1.3.9. It is highly desirable that the expansion occur before the lookup NOT after the lookup.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Well, you would have to rewrite the code with do_expand to rewrite first and then do the map lookup.
