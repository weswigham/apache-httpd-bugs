>Description:
I'm not sure where the problem is.  I just need an answer to a simple question.  If we can access the webserver within our LAN, should we be able to access it over the internet or are there any setting I need to configure?  We also have a router running NAT that may be the problem even though Cisco claims it is running fine.
