Installed on windows NT

This is a binary distribution for Windows 95/98/NT of 
Perl 5.6.0 together with mod_perl-1.23 and 
mod_ssl (2.6.3-1.3.12) / OpenSSL (0.9.5a) with Apache_1.3.12,
built with VC++ 6.0 (SP3).
>Description:
I installed the binary perl-win32-bin-0.6.exe on an NT machine. I then made the changes to httpd.conf as described in readme.txt and brief.txt. However when I try running apache.exe, I get this error message.

"Can't locate Cwd.pm in @INC (@INC contains: .) at (eval 1) line 1." and it dies.

However if I run it from c:\perl\5.6.0\lib\apache.exe IT WORKS!
>How-To-Repeat:
1. Install binary perl-win32-bin-0.6.exe
2. copy httpd-conf-dist-win to httpd.conf
3. type apache.exe from c: after making the appropriate changes to the autoexec.bat

Sorry!

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: fanf
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 24 08:53:43 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Perl modules are located by searching the directories in
@INC. Since you only have "." in @INC perl will only find
the modules if you run apache from the perl modules directory.
You need to set @INC to the right value to solve your problem.
