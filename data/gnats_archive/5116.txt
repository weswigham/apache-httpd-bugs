Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5
>Description:
I uninstalled the Win32 version of 1.3.6
and installed version 1.3.9 on a WinNT 4.0 machine......at first I
noticed that the "Install apache as a service" shortcut on the start
menu didn't work.....no biggie.....then I noticed that none of my CGI
scripts ran......I use ActivePerl version 519 by ActiveState.......
and perl wrapper written in C........
 
I uninstalled version 1.3.9 and reinstalled 1.3.6 and
everything worked just fine......

Do you know what's going on ??
