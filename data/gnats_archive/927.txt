State-Changed-Why:
I found this in the HTTP 1.0 protocol spec, RFC1945:
  Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after
  receiving a 302 status code, some existing user agents will
  erroneously change it into a GET request.]

I'm not sure which UAs they were referring to, but I bet this
is the cause of your problem.  At any rate, there's nothing
Apache could do to cause your browser to not POST data.

Thanks for the report.
