Linux comet.syrres.com 2.0.18 #1 Tue Sep 10 10:15:48 EDT 1996 i586

>Description:
when comping with the DBM Module included, the compiler dies saying -ldbm: 
no such file or directory  
>How-To-Repeat:
compile apache 1.2.1  with Module dbm_auth_module     mod_auth_dbm.o uncommented
in the Configuration file.
>Fix:
I looked at the 1.3.1 compile and it used a switch of -lndbm so
I went back into the 1.2.1 Makefile and changed the LIBS1= -lndbm and then everything 
worked fine.

State-Changed-Why:
1.3.1 doesn't exist; I assume you mean 1.3a1.

This is very dependent on your system setup.  The zillion
*db* libraries can appear in many different combinations.
Since it works with the 1.3 tree, there isn't really anything
we can do for the released 1.2...
