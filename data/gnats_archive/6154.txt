Solaris 2.5.1
>Description:
 I have a problem with two servers running Apache 1.3. One is running
 1.3.9 and the other 1.3.12. When, in the first, I try to view an address
 like http://www.anydomain.com/index.html/test/test/ (which does not
 exists) it doesn't tells me any kind of error: it shows me the page
 http://www.anydomain.com/index.html.
 In the second server (the one running 1.3.12), it shows me an error in
 the same case. I think this should be the right behaviour.
 Can anyone tell me if it's a version problem (as I think) or it can be
 configured in any file?

State-Changed-When: Wed Jun  7 12:04:43 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
That is how things are supposed to work.  If mod_include is
enabled for a page, then extra PATH_INFO at the end is
allowed and can be used by the page.  If it is just a static
file, then it isn't allowed.
