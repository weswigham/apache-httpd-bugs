>Description:
When using a CGI program, environment variable names like HTTP_REFERRER get
changed to '_____________' making it impossible to use them in a CGI program.
>How-To-Repeat:
Reverse the fix, described below.
>Fix:
I traced the error to old lib files. I used these:
        libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1.7.14
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.3.12

The problem dissapeared when I updated the lib files to these versions:
        libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1.9.9
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.4.44

State-Changed-Why:

Why do you think that a problem with your system's libraries
is something that should be fixed by Apache?  You've found
the fix yourself; there's nothing we can do about such
problems.
