Apache 1.3.4 Windows 98, no patch, binary distibution from apache.org

As a german, in a mindless moment I created a file named "qualität.html". With Apache 1.3.3 on Win95 there was no problem, but with Apache 1.3.4 on Win98 i get the error message "Forbidden - You do not have permition...".

After renaming the file to qualitaet.html the problem disappeared.
