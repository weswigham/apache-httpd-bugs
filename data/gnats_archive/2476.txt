Yes, there appears to be some kind of problem with Apache 1.3x on FreeBSD.
We had the same problems with the 1.3b7 release back in November, and we
reverted to 1.3a13.  I had submitted a couple of bug reports, and sent a
bunch of e-mail with one of the Apache people.  They're responsiveness was
really good, but nothing seemed to solve the problem.  When we found out
that it was a major pain to install FrontPage support into 1.3x, we went
back even farther to the 1.2.6 release (which was the last "official"
release version before 1.3.0 came out just recently).  We've had no problems
since.

We're likely to stay with 1.2.6 for the foreseeable future because we need
FrontPage and SSL -- no odd duck by any stretch, but that does not appear to
be getting much support.  (See note from Apache's Ken Coar at bottom).  My
comment to him was to have hooks in the Apache sources that could be
activated at compile time to link into a set of additional export-controlled
sources (or libraries), distributed by a third party, to facilitate SSL.
They could do this without breaking any export laws, because there's nothing
illegal about these bytes of source:

	#ifdef SSL
		some_ssl_api_function();
	#endif

The same could be done for FrontPage.  Oh well.

Don't bother with 1.3b7; 1.3.0 is officially released and out.
As for official hooks.. no, sorry.  FrontPage might be easier to
hook in (I remember discussions about it in the last few months,
but I don't use it and hence didn't pay attention to the details).
The SSLeay stuff, though - that's a sticky wicket because of
the U.S. arms restrictions.  Nothing official's been done there,
although Ben probably has something new and improved from
before.

Please reply to this message (*don't* forget to Cc the apbugs
address!) when you've had a chance to try out 1.3.0.  You could
always try running it in parallel with your production server,
just on different ports (e.g., 8087 instead of 80).
