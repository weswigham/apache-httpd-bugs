Hi, this is a small "change request":

Proxy error messages don't show the name of the (virtual) server.
This should be added to the error messages.

In a network of proxies and remote proxy servers, it's often
difficult to guess which server is responsible for error messages.


Mapping the proxy error messages via ErrorDocuments would also
be nice...

State-Changed-Why:
This is already fixed (as of 1.3b6-dev). You just
have to use the directive "ServerSignature on"
in the server configuration file and then a 
Squid-like footer message is automatically appended
to all proxy errors.
