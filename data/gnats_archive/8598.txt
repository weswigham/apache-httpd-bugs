Both vhost.nlm and status.nlm have same export symbol name as "status_module", so that apache has failed to load these modules.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: bnicholes
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 23 08:57:39 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed a problem with the release build of the project file for module vhost_alias.  The release build had mistakenly included the .def file for the status module rather than the vhost_alias module.
