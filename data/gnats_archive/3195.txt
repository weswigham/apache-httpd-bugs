>Description:
Currently I need to use programming languages which supports
STDIN/STDOUT (C,C++,Perl) to write CGI scripts, but actually I want to write
CGI in VB5 and another languages...
So I suggest if you can pipe CGI's STDIN to a file before starts a CGI program
, and send another file included STDOUT data to client after CGI process is done,
then I can do it well.
Just set an environment that indicate where I can find "STDIN" file,
and another environment that indicate where I can write my CGI output.

State-Changed-Why:
That is normally called "WinCGI".  Apache does not support
it and there are no plans to do so.  You really need to get
a more modern language.  Current versions of Visual Basic,
for example (I assume that is what you mean by "VB") can
use stdin and stdout just fine.

If that is not possible, it should be quite trivial to write
a wrapper that does this for you.  It is very slow and
inefficient though.
