>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Linux RedHat 7.1 stock installation
>Description:
When apache's error_log hits 2 gigs, it will crash when it tries to write to it.  And since it cant write to the error log, there's no way to find out why it crashed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Get some really bad programmers and create 2 gigs of error messages in a week like we did.  =)
>Fix:
Check file size and manually rotate the logs when approaching 2 gigs.
