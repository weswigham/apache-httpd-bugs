>Description:
I´ve just run into a problem. I am about to run aprox 350 virtual domains 
on one Apache server on a SGI server. However, I started to add a couple of 
domains (more then I had before), I am using error, access, referer and 
agent logs. However, Apache reported the following problem:

httpd: could not open error log file /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/www.ahston.se-error_log.

I deleted the file thinking it was corrupt or something like that. I 
deleted all my error logs. 
Restarted Apache, and the same error. I have tried both Apache 1.1.3 and 1.2.0
and I get the same error. When I decided to cut away several Agent and 
Referer logs, Apache went up smooth and nice.

However, I have only added 20 new domains, and have 250 more to go. 
My question that follows is:
Is there some kind of lock how many files Apache handles at the same time? 
Or is there something I missed? I haven´t found a hint reading the newsgroups, 
FAQs and so on. Or, is this some kind of bug? I am clueless....
>How-To-Repeat:
You could get my httpd.conf file or setting up 100 virtual domains all
running with Agent, referer, error and Access logs.
>Fix:
No

This is not a limit with Apache, but a limit of your OS.
Depending on the version of IRIX and the architecture 
you are running on, you may be limited to 256 FILE *
structures by the OS.  You can try a "ulimit -n unlimited"
before starting the server, but there is a good chance 
that won't work because of the FILE * problem.
