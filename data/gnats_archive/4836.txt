 It looks like there is some support for DRS 6000 machines in some of the
 files.  But that really just means that somebody did the work to port it
 at one time or another.  The best thing I can suggest is looking through
 the configuration scripts and determine if there are any obvious holes.  I
 would also suggest reading the PORTING document.
