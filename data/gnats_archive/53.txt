>Description:
We started getting numerous reports from AOL users of problems accessing virtual servers that we host within a day of installing the new Apache 1.2 beta. The problems forced us to revert to the older version. 

As Ingram Leedy noted in an earlier thread, when a client from AOL connects from its web browser to an Apache 1.2 server the following message is displayed:

----
UNSUPPORTED WEB VERSION

The web address you requested is not available in a version
supported by AOL. This is an issue with the web site, and not with AOL.

The owner of this site is using an unsupported HTTP language.
If you recieve this message frequently, you want to set your web
graphics preferences to compressed at KEYWORD: PREFERENCES.
----

This is a serious problem......changing the AOL browser settings
for compressed or uncompressed images does NOT solve the 
problem, so basically Apache 1.2 is dead in the water until a fix is found for this problem.

It looks like it may have to do with Apache 1.2 reporting

SERVER_PROTOCOL	HTTP/1.1

instead of 

SERVER_PROTOCOL	HTTP/1.0

Does anyone have more info on this? We'd really like to take advantage of 1.2, but too many of our customers cater to AOL users for it to be viable without a fix.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
allow SERVER_PROTOCOL to be based on browser/service type.%0
