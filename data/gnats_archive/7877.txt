Redhat 6.2
>Description:
Apache (httpd) is causing a error 404 on files with mpl or Mpl in the name (not the extension). These files are server controled files that the server sends for download via web interface. Renaming the file to any other name (removing the mpl from the name) and Apache alows the download.
>How-To-Repeat:
Save a file with a name like simpletest.dat and then chmod to 704. Have the web document point to the file file. The dir where the file is has chmod 755.
>Fix:
No.

State-Changed-Why:
What appears in the error log for this request?

Are you the server administrator?  Are you sure there is no
special configuration designed to prevent certain types of
files from being served?  Apache does not just do this
with a default configuration.
