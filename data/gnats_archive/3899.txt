This observed immediately after download and setup.(Setup on e:\Apache).
It appears these files were not present in the download package??
Can you recommend a fix?

 Sirs:
   Subsequent to first message I uninstalled Apache from e:\ and
 reinstalled to the default
 settings on c:\.  This was successful and Apache started OK.  However,
 it will not shut-
 down gracefully (using "apache -k shutdown").  I have to use Ctrl-C to
 stop it - am I
 missing something in the instructions?  Also, I'm curious as to why the
 default files were
 missing in the first install to e:\Apache .
 Thanks for the reply,
 Mo Welch
