>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP4 and SP3
>Description:
On occasion, we are seeing a phantom CGI request not correlating to a browser
or executable request. The request is the exact same as one that occured 45 
minutes to 4 days priot. In all cases, the stated source IP was not responsible 
for the request.

Also, the user authentication is 'remembered'
>How-To-Repeat:
Heck, we can barely reproduce it. It seems to happen about once every couple of
days on server being hit several thousand times a day.
