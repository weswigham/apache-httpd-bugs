State-Changed-Why:
Did you check the FAQ?  Your winsock2 must support 
DuplicateSocket - if you are using a VPN driver or some
firewall layers - it won't work.  Does Apache 1.3.22 work
on this same machine?

State-Changed-Why:
Ok, not the intent of the original report - but this was very
interesting :)  Notice the second error in the report - this
makes little to zero sense.  Perhaps our formaterror call then
wiped out the 'real' error?  Need to look at apr strerror.c.
