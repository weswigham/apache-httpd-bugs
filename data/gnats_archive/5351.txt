>Description:
We use a several that excepts multipart/form-data which is basicly used 
for uploading files to the system.  The code is hanging up a readLine from
the input stream into a buffer.  I assume it is hanging because it does not see
a carriage return not does it see the end of stream.  Eventually the call times
out or something, but it takes an awefully long time.  If we back off to version
1.0 of Apache Jserv the problem goes away.  After looking at the lines as they
are read in it appears that all the fields of the form are getting posted.  I
think it is the closing line of the post format that is missing the line feed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compare the post data from a form with multipart/form-data when submitted 
to an Apache Jserv 1.0 servlet as opposed to an Apache Jserv 1.1 servlet and
see why the difference are appearing
>Fix:
No
