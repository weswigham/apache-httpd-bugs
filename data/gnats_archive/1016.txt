State-Changed-Why:
Please try without the fastcgi module if possible.

What state does ps show the children to be in?  (ps -al
is probably best)

Does the system mount anything over NFS?

 Just in case you're not familiar with Apache's spawning model please read
 the htdocs/manual/stopping.html file that comes with it.  Spawning 7
 copies is normal.

 Below is an example
 
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI NI     ADDR     SZ    WCHAN TTY      TIME CMD
  8 S   800  2681     1  0  51 20 50f72cc8    236 50ed483a ?        0:00 httpd

 Loads of stuff.
 
 In case it's of use, below is the output from pstack:
 
 2681:   httpd -d /home/shipleym/www/uw0838
  ef5b6f94 _libc_fcntl (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) + 8
 
 I have also applied the solaris_dup patch since I reported the problem but the
  problem still exists.

 Add "LockFile /var/tmp/htlock" to your httpd.conf file. 
 
 pstack, cool I haven't seen that command before.

Another lockfile on NFS problem.  It's unfortunate we can't
easily detect this.
