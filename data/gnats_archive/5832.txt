>Description:
I hope this is not considered a configuration question,
but I was wondering since your documentation has fallen out of 
date with regards to the linux kernel, if the problem of 256 max file 
descriptors has been solved? It mentioned the problem being solved in
Kernel 2.1? Any up to date information about the limit 
would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Bill.
