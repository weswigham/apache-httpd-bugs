>Environment:
Linux - Redhat 6.0 - kernel 2.2.12 - Blackdown Java 1.2-prev2
>Description:
I was unable to alias any servlet code in the zone.properties:
servlet.ALIAS.code=org.someone.servlet.ClassName

This never created an alias "ALIAS" that could be used for
initArgs, or for 'ApJservAction' statements in the jserv.conf file.

>How-To-Repeat:
It was very repeatable here, I had to NOT USE the alias mechanism to make it 
run servlets.
>Fix:
No - just the workaround - don't use aliases :-/
