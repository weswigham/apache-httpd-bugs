BSD/OS jones.nas.com 2.1 BSDI BSD/OS 2.1 Kernel #0: Wed Mar 12 13:15:28 PST 1997     root@jones.nas.com:/usr/src/sys/compile/JONES  i386
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
The -s pattern in RewriteCond always returns not-matched, even if the file
named by the TestString exists, is readable, and has non-zero size.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a RewriteCond using -s as a pattern that should match. For example,
RewriteCond /bin/sh -s
should always match (assuming /bin/sh exists), but never does.
>Fix:
It appears that apply_rewrite_cond in mod_rewrite.c looks for "-s " (with a
trailing blank) instead of "-s".  The following context diff fixes the problem:
