Redhat Linux 7.1 fully patched.
2.4.3-12 Kernel i686 PII 450mghz
Apache 1.3.19 Redhat RPM and
Apache 1.3.20 compiled from Redhat SRPM
>Description:
CGIs located in a user's web space (http://someserver.com/~username/ascript.cgi)
will return a 500 internal server error.  The err_log will return Premature end of script headers.  I know this sounds like a misconfiguration of the config file or bad permssions but it's not. Here's an excerpt of my config for users.
--------cut------------
UserDir www

#
# Control access to UserDir directories.  The following is an example
# for a site where these directories are restricted to read-only.
#

<Files *.cgi>
 Options +ExecCGI
</Files>

<Directory ~ "/websites/dept/[a-z]+/www/[a-z]+">
 AllowOverride All
 Options multiViews indexes symLinksIfOwnerMatch includesNoExec +ExecCGI
 IndexOptions +FancyIndexing +NameWidth=*
</Directory>
---------end cut---------------

This should allow CGIs to run, but they fail everytime.  I can move the cgi to the root of the server (http://server.com/ascript.cgi) and it will run fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure apache to run user space CGIs and watch it fail.  
---Example failed script---
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "WTF?\n"
EOF
------end script------
will fail
>Fix:
I'm totally at a loss, It's possible that I've misconfigured something but I'm not sure what, I've tried this on multiple machines all with the same result.  It may be a problem with the redhat RPMs. Please advise.  thank you.

State-Changed-Why:
RedHat likes to enable random features like suexec in their RPMs.  This is almost certainly the reason for your CGIs failing; look at the suexec log, whereever redhat decided to put it, and the suexec docs for details.

 Thank you very much. I would have never figured that out.  I disabled
 suexec and everything seems to be working.  
 
 Thank you again.
