State-Changed-Why:
Is your Apache installation on a NFS mounted patition?
That is bad and a silly thing to do.

Adding a "LockFile /var/tmp/accept.lock" to your
httpd.conf may fix this, assuming /var/tmp isn't NFS
mounted.

What the error is saying is that file locking isn't
working properly on your system.  This is normally caused
by NFS issues.

Assuming LockFile directive solved the problem.
