>Description:
We use Apache 1.3.0 with documents on an AFS file server. In the seldom
event of an AFS server failure (errno ETIMEDOUT for the file access, see
errorlog line below) Apache responds with an error "403 - Forbidden". 
I'd expect a "404 - File not found" error or a "503 Service Unavailable"
failure. Probably this could be changed in the sources only...

error.log:
[Fri Jul 24 00:00:02 1998] [error] (145)Connection timed out: access to ...
failed for ...

State-Changed-Why:

This is a deliberate decision.  If a resource is not
available, Apache returns 403 rather than revealing
information about whether the resource actually exists
or not.  The same thing happens when Apache can't access
a .htaccess file; it assumes the worst and reveals
nothing.  But thank you for your report and for using
Apache!

 I think it would be a good idea to make this configurable, 
 ala mapping between system's errno and HTTP status.
