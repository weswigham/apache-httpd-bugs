FreeBSD 2.1.7.1, gcc version 2.6.3
>Description:
I have a CGI script in a directory that has an ".htaccess" file requiring
the user to belong to a certain group.  If I enter that CGI URL as a browser
location, it correctly challanges me for username and password.  The same thing
happens when I get to the CGI via the "GET" method.  In both cases, the script
is run with the "REMOTE_USER" environment variable set to the username, and
the access log file shows the access coming from username.

However, if I get there via a POST method (with a freshly started browser, of
course), it lets me right into the script.  Unlike the above two methods, the
script is run _without_ "REMOTE_USER" set, and the access log file shows the
access coming from user "-".  No error messages appear in the error log.

The above behavior also happens if the browser has already supplied the username
and password.  I.e., the script is run without "REMOTE_USER" set and the access
log shows the user "-".

It's as if apache forgets to check for ".htaccess" when the method is POST.

FYI - I don't know if it makes any difference, but the CGI is under a virtual
server.  Also, the cgi-bin directory is under the document tree, with an
appropriate ScriptAlias in the httpd.conf file.

 And exactly what do you have in the .htaccess file?  A "Limit GET" by
 any chance?  If so, that will limit GETs just as it says.

 HEY!!!  How did you manage to hack into our site and read our .htaccess file???
 
 So, to protect myself from everything, I just get rid of the <Limit ...>
 and </Limit> lines.  Then, just like it says, "If an access control
 directive appears outside a <Limit> directive, then it applies to all
 access methods."  (See http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#limit)

 Sorry and thanks.
