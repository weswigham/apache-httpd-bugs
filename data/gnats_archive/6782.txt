>Description:
Got/compiled OpenSSL.  Seemed to work ok. (no errors)
tried Apache install.
This is what I did:   (I was in the /usr/src/apache_1.3.12 directory 
when I was running it.
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache	(even made a directory for it)
       (I had also tried ./configure --prefix=/usr/src/apache_1.3.12)
  make
 When 'make' was done--- got many errors.  first error was 
             'apache_ssl.c:184: parse error before 'BOOL'
   next lines ----  .....c:184 warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
			....c:201 parse error before 'bFakeBasicAuth'
   and it continues from there.

State-Changed-Why:

Since this is clearly a problem with the ssl module,
you will need to contact whomever supplies the ssl
module to get support.  We don't know anything
about this code.
Thanks for using Apache.
