>Release:        1.3.3
>Environment:
RedHat Linux 5.1 - Kernel 2.0.35 - Glibc 2.0.7
>Description:
Linux box has two interfaces (virtual, eth0 & eth0:0). Interface one is
xxx.xxx.xxx.1 (private.foo.com), interface two is xxx.xxx.xxx.2 (proxy.foo.com).
Apache listens only on interface two. The proxy connects to remote hosts with
a source address of xxx.xxx.xxx.1 (private.foo.com) instead of xxx.xxx.xxx.2
(proxy.foo.com). The proxy server should use the same address for the source
as the address it is listening on, no? 
>How-To-Repeat:
See description
>Fix:
Explicitly set the source address when opening the socket instead of depending
on the OS to pick the correct one?
