>Description:
While surfing on a newsgroup (Prodigy.Net) I clicked on a link and without any question or explanation, Apache "Something" was installed in my PC.  I can not find where it is or how to remove it.  My major problem is that I no longer have access to my family picture online storage at Easynews.com.   HELP !!!!!  Please tell me how to remove this Apache 'whatever' from my computer.  Thank you.... R Joyce

PS: I saved one "Test Page" from the site I got Apache from and the next time I clicked it, I got automatically redirected to a Filthy PORN Site.  Not NICE !!!!

State-Changed-Why:
We have nothing to do with this.  Apache is web server software;
if someone installs it on a site, it comes with a default
page.  We have zero control over that.
