>Environment:
Apache_1_3b3_win32.exe under  Windows 95
>Description:
The file descriptor value is increased on every CGI script call by 3, causing out of fd's error after a few runs. No files can be opened any more.
>How-To-Repeat:
Test-C Program:

#include <io.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

main()
{
  int	fd;
  printf ("Content-Type: TEXT/HTML\n\n");
  fd = open ("??ANYFILE", O_RDONLY|O_BINARY);
  printf ("fd is %d", fd);
  close (fd);
  return 0;
}

>Fix:
fd's 0 to 2 are not closed after CGI run%3
