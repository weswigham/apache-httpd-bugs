Linux main 2.0.36 #6 Tue Jan 19 21:27:56 EET 1999 i686 unknown
>Description:
Access logging stopped for one of my virtual hosts after a couple of hours.
I have seen the same problem reported (#3512). The cause there was ulimits.
The access log file size for me is 7945 bytes and there are no file size
ulimits. I have HostNameLookups turned on.
I suppose that if I restart the daemon it will start logging again.
The serving for the virtual host works ok.
>How-To-Repeat:
I haven't tried to repeat it.
