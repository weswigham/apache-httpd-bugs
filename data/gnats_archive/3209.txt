>Description:
Under Apache 1.2.4 I was using the following in some .htaccess files
<Files "?*">
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Some Domain"
AuthDBUserFile "/path/to/dbfile"
...
</Files>
<Files "index.html">
allow from all
</Files>

The idea being that index.html should be viewable without restrictions
but that everything else should require a password. This worked fine
under 1.2.4 (even when index.html is a directory :)) but not under
1.3.1 or 1.3.3.

Under 1.3.x a password is always requested with this setup. If I remove
the <Files "?*"> around the restrictions then explicit requests for
index.html work fine (no password) but requests to the directory do
not.

Set up the above scenario (unfortunately I am inside a firewall
and cannot put an example anywhere visible).

Use "satisfy any" in the <Files index.html> section.

         Apologies for insufficient information, "satisfy any" is setup by
 default in the config file. I have now tried adding it to the <Files index.html>
 section but that has changed none of the behaviour.
 
         I am aware the "?*" is matching the index, but in 1.2.4 this all
 behaved nicely - the most specific match to the filename was taken and all
 behaved intuitively well. Perhaps this was a happy accident, if so would be
 nice if it were a defined behaviour (just my 2d).

         Actually after deeper thought on this, the basic problem is that "?*"
 is matching requests to the directory in 1.3.x which it didn't in 1.2.4.
