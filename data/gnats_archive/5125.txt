>Description:
I have an Apache 1.3.9 server with apache-ssl, mod php and mod_perl compiled in.
All are the latest versions as of this writing.  The problem is my server does 
not recognize the Order directive when the intial 'O' is upper case.  This is 
obviously not a major problem once I was aware that I could use a lower case o. 
But I could not use the same config file as I was using with my 1.3.6 server.
>How-To-Repeat:
see problem description
>Fix:
use lower case 'o'
