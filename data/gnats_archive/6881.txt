>Description:
I have been using AliasMatch to map an application virtual path to my application's web content directory. My intention is that if you put in the virtual path without a trailing slash it will enter the application, but it should not match a longer word that just happens to start with the name of my application. The syntax I use is as follows:
  AliasMatch ^/myapp($|/.*) "E:/Program Files/MyAppDir/webcontent$1"
but it no longer works. If I revert to this (somewhat less satisfactory) form:
  Alias /myapp "E:/Program Files/MyAppDir/webcontent"
then it works.
The first form worked in 2.0a7.

>How-To-Repeat:
Create an alias to a content directory on your PC with AliasMatch e.g.
    AliasMatch "/docs($|/.*)" "C:/Docs$1"
Place a default file into that directory e.g. "index.html" with some appropriate content.
Try the url http://localhost/docs
It should bring up the "index.html" with typical Apache defaults. Instead I receive a "Not Found" error.
If you replace the AliasMatch with a more normal Alias e.g.
    Alias "/docs" "C:/Docs"
then things work as expected but it will also match other names e.g. /docs2.
