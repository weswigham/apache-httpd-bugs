HPUX 10.20, JSDK2.0, mod_Jserv1.0b from 981117, gcc
>Description:
Servlets not accessing the local file system are working pretty well. Nevertheless, one servlets should read several property-files from local file system. Now it looks like the security manager does not allow the servlet to access the file system. Also I can't find any logging of the JVM even with trace=on.

Is there any possibility to get my servlet trusted by the JVM, or to disable the security manager on the JVM?

State-Changed-Why:
this is probably a unix perms problem (JServ has no
SecurityManager); as w/ PR # 3446, unless I get a
report that that isn't your problem, I'll close this
PR in a couple of days.
