>Description:
Related documentation bug: 
The instructions for manual installation in the INSTALL file
don't mention that you
have to copy jserv.gif along with the *.[ch] files in 
src/c/.  If it's not there, fopen() returns NULL and jserv_mkimg just 
dumps core.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Fix the instructions for manual installation, and apply 
the patch at ftp://starship.skyport.net/pub/crew/amk/mod_jserv-patch

The patch prints an error message if the input or output files
can't be opened, and also changes the return type of main()
to int.
