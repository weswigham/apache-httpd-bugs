>Environment:
linux 2.1.97 (also 2.0.x, and 2.1.x)
gcc 2.7.2
Spanstor, software toaster.
>Description:
/www(this is our web server document root only) is mounted to nfs1:/1/www 
(this is the Spanstor disk array). /usr/local/web is the ServerRoot (where the
conf files, log files, and binary reside). As the number of connections rises,
(to a virtual site) the number of spawned children rise as well. Up to about 40
simultaneous children there is not really a problem, but after that, it seems 
the children do no die right away and therefore, the parent must spawn a 
seperate child to handle more incoming requests. This eventually causes the 
load average to increase, the machine to slow down, and sometimes the process
table to fill up. We've tried various nfs mounting options as well as web
server options. Nothing affects it enough to make it worthwhile. We don't have
this problem when we serve the documents off of a local disk.

We're wondering if this is a possible NFS problem with the particular NFS disk 
array system that we are trying to use, or if anyone has had other problems with
devices such as NetApps...(though i have noticed that the netapp handles this
situation a little better)
>How-To-Repeat:
put a heavy virtual site over an NFS mounted partition(using a netapp or spanstor)
disk array system.)
>Fix:
I'm not sure if this is an apache problem or an NFS problem honestly

State-Changed-Why:
Is /usr/local/web NFS mounted as well?  If so try moving
the LockFile to a local disk.

Do you have any indication that the processes are actually
blocked on NFS operations?  Like use strace or something
on the stuck children...
