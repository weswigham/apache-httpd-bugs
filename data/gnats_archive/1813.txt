>Description:
After a CGI-Script returns (only POST method) i get some HTTP-Headers in 
the document.  Example Output:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<TITLE>Passwort f. HTTP-Server &auml;ndern</TITLE>
<body>
<h1>Passwort wurde geändert</h1>
</body>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 16 Feb 1998 15:16:58 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3b3
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

After this i get the "internal error" message "<h1>OK</h1>"
>How-To-Repeat:
If you wish i can send you the .shtml and cgi script (python 1.5 with 
mod_python)
>Fix:
I think the problem is that the programm does not check if a header-string
is empty and always appends newlines.  [spurious newlines are added; grep 
for "\015\012" through 'src/main/http_protocol.c']
I think you bvputs/rvputs (or a wrapper around this) should test.

To hide the "OK"-Error-Message i applied this patch:

 This it the output from where?  What are the headers on this response?

 Are you sure it is not a problem with mod_python?
 
 Is there any authentication required for the document in question?
 
 Can you repeat it by hand, eg. telnetting to the port and entering the
 request yourself?

 No, but i can make a try without mod_python ... you are right, the problem
 seems to be in mod_python. 
 
 This is what i found out
 external python:  GET ok   POST ok
 mod_python:       GET ok   POST not ok
 
 (mod_python.c Revision: 4.2 Date: 1998/01/25 10:29:29)
 
 I think i go back to external python.
 
 MS> Is there any authentication required for the document in question?
 Yes, there is a .htaccess file in the directory where the html-pages are 
 stored and in the /cgi-sbin/ directory.

 As i understand the http protocol there must be a empty newline between the
 headers and the body (like in a e-mail), right ?
 If so: if you put out a empty string followed by a newline the header will
 end and the body starts, this is what i thought what goes wrong.
 
 Thanks for your quick anser,
 		greetings Carsten

 And if you remove the authentication, does it work?
 
 What client are you using?

 Erm... but what would be doing that?  If the script is doing it, it is
 broken.
 
 Give a snapshot of the current to-be-1.2.6 tree at:
 
 	http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/1.2/
 
 It may fix the issue.
