>Description:
Using the rewrite rules given in 'How can we repeat this problem?', although a
request of '/artichoke/hello' redirects to '/artichoke/HELLO', a request of
'/artichoke' or '/artichoke/' hangs.
This occurs with tolower and toupper, but not (AFAICS) with prg: maps.

RewriteMap      uc                              int:toupper
RewriteRule     ^/artichoke(/(.*)$|$)           /artichoke/${uc:$2}     [R=permanent]

 Seems not like a problem related to RewriteMaps. Instead your rules are
 problematic. Your rules force a loop!
 
 You should either remove the redirect (i.e. translate to upper case only
 internally) or use a better URL pattern for the RewriteRule which avoids the
 redirect when the URL already is upper-case. For instance:
 
   RewriteMap      uc            int:toupper
   RewriteRule     ^/artichoke   /artichoke/   [R]
   RewriteRule     ^/artichoke/(.*[a-z].*)$    /artichoke/${uc:$1}  [R=permanent]

 Please forgive me if I'm misunderstanding this, but there is still an
 _internal_ loop with the null request.  Consider the two requests
 '/artichoke/HELLO' and '/artichoke/' - both of which would be loops as far
 as the browser is concerned.  The first results in a redirect to the same
 address.  However, the second results in a hanging request, no response sent
 to the browser, and a child process which sits in a tight loop consuming CPU
 until the parent httpd is TERMed.
 
 [OK, the rules don't make a great deal of sense on their own, but I actually
 hit this using similar rules in the midst of a big pile, moving a hierarchy
 from one location to another and rewriting every file and directory name en
 route.  Don't ask...!]
 
 Cheers

State-Changed-Why:
Seems definetely like a loop in his rewrite rules.
I cannot  reproduce any loops myself.
