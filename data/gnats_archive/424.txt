State-Changed-Why:
I seem to have messed up the bugdb.
>Unformatted:

In mod_cgi find the line:

nph = !(strncmp(argv0,"nph-",4));

And replace it with:

nph = 0;

to disable nph scripts.  But that won't let your push thing work...  it's
very likely that we'll have a method of doing this without nph in post-1.2
(and will eliminate nph). 

A more reliable way to track usage is at your router.  Then you'll also be
counting packet overhead.  But this doesn't help unless all your customers
use different ip addresses. 

I'm going to close the ticket.
