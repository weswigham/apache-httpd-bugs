Windows NT4.0, JDK1.2.1, JSDK 2.0, JDBC 2.0, Oracle 8i, 
Apache Webserver 1.3.11, Apache JServ 1.1
>Description:
I'm trying execute my servlet in Apache webserver 1.3.11 (using Apache JServ 1.1). My servlet accesses Oracle 8i database using Orcale JDBC-ODBC bridge. 
When I call my servlet from my browser, it is saying oci.dll missing and hence couldn't make connection to the database. 
Actually, a standalone program running under JVM (with the same database access code) is able to make connection. Also that I could execute my servlets using other webservers such as Java webserver and Lite webserver without any problem and without modifying any configuration settings.  
I feel that the problem is with Apace webserver and JServ combination that is giving trouble becuase I could run my servlets using other webservers.
I want to host my servlets only in webserver.
Please help me.
