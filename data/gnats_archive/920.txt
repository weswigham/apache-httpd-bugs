>Description:
As http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#options states that with
FollowSymLinks, the directory isn't re-written and compared.  Thus,
if a user does something like `ln -s / root' in the right place,
folks can walk the directory tree.  

This isn't a big deal for places (like us) which give CGI access, but 
your docs advise a <directory /> deny... </directory> clause already.  
The User* bit in 1.3 is a nice idea, but a single-line htaccess (deny
from all) is simpler.  And some folks here already cross-link in the 
file system, so I can't use SymLinksIfOwnerMatch.

Of course, this assumes you allow htaccess files under user directories.

>Fix:
Eh, it's not a huge deal.  No response necessary, either

offline discussion ... it's really not a simple thing to
workaround.  Something to consider post-1.3.
