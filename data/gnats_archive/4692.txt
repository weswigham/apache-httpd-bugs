(Also see Bug PR# 2796)

After running src/Configure with no arguments, compilation of 
src/alloc.c fails:

gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DSOLARIS2=260  alloc.c
alloc.c: In function `spawn_child_core':
alloc.c:2170: `STDOUT_FILENO' undeclared (first use in this function)
alloc.c:2170: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
alloc.c:2170: for each function it appears in.)
alloc.c:2176: `STDIN_FILENO' undeclared (first use in this function)
alloc.c:2182: `STDERR_FILENO' undeclared (first use in this function)
>How-To-Repeat:
Unpack standard installation on SunOS 5.6
go to src directory
$ ./Configure
$ make
>Fix:
Since these constants are defined in /usr/include/unistd.h, the problem 
seems to be that this header file isn't included. The simplest fix is 
to edit src/include/ap_config.h, and add 

#define HAVE_UNISTD_H

to the solaris2 section.
