>Description:
Netscape, in its most recent client, makes use of a "new" HTTP directive (MOVE).
In parallel with support for PUT and DELETE, I've patched Apache to handle the
MOVE directive.

In case the text that I paste into the "suggested fix" box doesn't make it, you
can also fetch the patch from the posting I made to comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.
That can be had at: http://www.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=405799286
>How-To-Repeat:
(Not really a bug, but a limitation of the current implementation.)
>Fix:
Following is the text of the patch (and description) I posted a little while ago:

The most recent release of Netscape Communicator (4.5) can use an HTTP
server to save and load users' profiles.  To achieve this, it uses the
HTTP methods "PUT", "GET", "DELETE", and (unfortunately) the more
exotic "MOVE".  (Yes, I am aware that there is a non-GUI configuration
setting that prevents NS from using "MOVE", but out of the box, it
uses "MOVE".  Here's a reference for the anti-MOVE configuration
setting: <URL:http://www.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=403965014>).

The "MOVE" method is currently unsupported by the Apache WWW server.
The following patch adds the "MOVE" method to the server source code.
Note that, as with "PUT", there are serious configuration and security
implications of supporting this method.  Furthermore, this patch just
gives the framework to allow some server-side process to deal with the
"MOVE" method but doesn't directly implement any action (directly
parallel to the way Apache handles "PUT" et al.).  

Another thing to note is that the "MOVE" method (at least as used by
Netscape Communicator 4.5) encapsulates the target URI name in an HTTP
header labelled "New-URI".  This patch gives no direct access to the
URI value of that header (though that information is accessible to
Apache modules -- see the next message in this two-message series).  

This message (1/2) contains the patch to the Apache server 1.3.3 code
itself.  The next message (2/2) is a coordinated change I made to the
"mod_put.c" module.  That module is not distributed with Apache, but
can be found (along with many others) via the Apache Module Registry
located at <URL:http://modules.apache.org>.

Apply the patch in this message by making the top of the Apache source
code your current directory (e.g. "cd /wherever/apache_1.3.3").  Then
give the command: 
                patch -p1 < /path/to/this/patchfile

One key thing to note is that this patch changes the values of the
constants that define the method types (in httpd.h).  Any code that
depends on these constants will need to be recompiled.
