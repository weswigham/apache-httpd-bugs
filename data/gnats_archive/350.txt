SunOS 4.1.3 1 sun4c
gcc version 2.7.2
>Description:
during the build stage linking fails due to not found symbol _memmove
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
in mod_proxy.h (under modules/proxy) adding the following lines:

/* for old systems with bcopy() but no memmove() */
#ifdef USEBCOPY
#define memmove(d, s, c)        bcopy(s, d, c)
#endif

will eliminate the problem
