Linux fusion 2.0.35 #6 Tue Jul 14 22:03:23 SAT 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
When I run the APACI configuration script, and use the --add-module parameter to manually add "mod_rewrite.c" to the configuration, the configure script will not copy mod_rewrite.h from the "src/modules/standard" directory to the "src/modules/extra" directory. 

This will cause a fatal error (obviously) during the compilation of the mod_rewrite module. This can be fixed by copying the mod_rewrite.h file to the "src/modules/extra" directory manually before calling "make".

This should be fixed :)
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the following code:

./configure --prefix="/usr/local/apache" --add-module="./src/modules/standard/mo
d_rewrite.c"

Then run "make". During configuration everything goes fine, but during compile mod_rewrite causes an error which aborts the compile.
>Fix:
Copy mod_rewrite.h into the extra directory as well, not just mod_rewrite.c. Once I did that, I had no problems compiling.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... then don't do that.  The whole point of --add-module is
to be used _only_ for simple third party modules that do not
require any extra files.  First, mod_rewrite isn't a third party
module so you shouldn't be using add-module.  Second, it
requires more than one file so even if it was then add-module
wouldn't be appropriate for it.
