>Description:
Durring make I get this error:

make: *** No rule to make target 'gcache.h', needed by 'gcacheclient.o'. Stop.

Of course make then stops. The Makefile has:

gcache.o gcachecommon.o gcacheclient.o apache_ssl.o: gcache.h

gcache: gcache.o gcachecommon.o
              $(CC) $(LFLAGS) -o gcache gcache.o gcachecommon.o $(LIBS)

Is all of this right? What is the problem that is keeping it from compiling?

Thanks for any help,

Sorry, "gcache.h" is definately not part of the Apache source
code... so you're on your own.  I suggest contacting the authros
of the other stuff you're using.

 Yeh, after comparing all the 'Makefiles.*' that I had I saw the problem was 
 not the Apache build but the Apache+ssl patches.
 
 After wiping out the apache_1.2.6 dir and reinstalling it from the tar ball 
 it configed and compiled just fine.
 
 Do you (or anyone) know of anyone that has gotten apache+ssl to work?
 Does anyone know of a mailing list that covers it?
 
 Well as I am not a programer I hope that somewhere out there is the answers 
 I need. Thanks for your response even though I leaves me back a square one.
 
 Later,
 Paul Pettit
