FreeBSD 2.2.7-STABLE
>Description:
1.3.2 displays target file path when forbidden page is required.

e.g.
Forbidden
client denied by server configuration: /path/to/denied_file

I think it is not good because of security/privacy reason.
I suggest that check_dir_access() in mod_access.c should be changed not to include target file path.
