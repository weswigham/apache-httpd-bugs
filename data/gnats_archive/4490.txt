>Description:
The current mod_cgi prevents back-end systems (such as 
application servers) from handling OPTIONS requests. This
effectively prevents any back-end system (accessed via
cgi) from supporting WebDAV, because DAV clients use an 
OPTIONS request to determine DAV support by a given resource.

I've sent along a patch that allows cgis to handle OPTIONS.
The patch is tested and running on our internal servers.
If I can answer any questions or elaborate on the problem,
please get in touch w/me:

State-Changed-Why:

As the comment in the source remarks, very few CGI scripts
will respond correctly to an OPTIONS request.  The current
draft of the CGI/1.1 spec allows the server to intercept
this method (see <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/CGI/>).  This
would have to be selectably controllable (i.e., would need
a directive to enable/disable it for specific scopes) to
keep unaware scripts from responding incorrectly.  I'm
marking this as suspended so it won't be forgotten, even
though it's on the list for the next major release cycle.

 Thanks for the quick response. I presume that this would be
 done quicker if I submitted a patch implementing a HandleOptions
 directive of some sort. Should I submit that as a separate
 change request in the bug db, or as a continuation of this 
 thread?
 
 Thanks,

 Reply in this thread.  I suggest a directive name involving
 the words "OPTIONS," "CGI," and "Pass."  There is no guarantee
 when/if it will be accepted or make it into the source, but it's
 more likely if there's a patch for it than otherwise.
