>Description:
On our server we have several website but only one IP so we decided 
to use the directive "Alias" from Apache.

With jserv 0.9.X we didn't have any problem to use :

Alias /WebSiteName /home/WebSiteName
ServletAlias /WebSiteName/servlets /home/WebSiteName/servlet

But now we didn't find the solution to use the same propriety
with ApacheJServ-1.1-b2.rpm:

Alias /WebSiteName /home/WebSiteName
ApJServMount /WebSiteName/servlet 
repositories...

The problem is that Apache remplaces always the '/WebSiteName'
by /home/WebSiteName if a servlet is called like that:

http://www.serverName.com/WebSiteName/servlet/Hello.class

Thank's a lot to help us.

Lionel enkaoua.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
Alias /WebSiteName /home/WebSiteName
ApJServMount /WebSiteName/servlet 
repositories...

http://www.serverName.com/WebSiteName/servlet/Hello.class

No idea.
