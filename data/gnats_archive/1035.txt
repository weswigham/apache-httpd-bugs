This caused the browser (Netscape Communicator 4.02) to just sit and wait with the "waiting for reply...." status.
Only the root process started on the server...no child processes were spawned.
Not all of our virtuals (the older-style virtuals, not HTTP/1.1) had this problem although all were using the same copy of the httpd.
Some of the virtual servers had links to NFS-mounted drives.
Server load increased nearly 10-fold as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try NFS-mounting a drive and having HTML documents exist on the other side of that mount. See if that will do it.
>Fix:
Nope, but I would love to know when you hear of one. Had this problem with 1.2.1 as well but due to the amount of bugs with that we just reverted back to 1.2.0. We are running 1.2.0 right now

Try adding a:

    LockFile /var/tmp/accept.lock

to your config files, assuming /var/tmp is not NFS
mounted.  The problem is probably that NFS locking isn't.

 It goes into whatever config file you want; any one of your main conf
 files.
 
 If you have multiple seperate copies of Apache running using different
 config files, each should use a different name.
