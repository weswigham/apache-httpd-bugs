 Are there any messages in your error log?

 Um, how am I supposed to go there?  What am I supposed to do?

 Do you understand Apache's spawning model?  It preforks servers.  If
 you're sitting there killing httpds it will continually spawn more.  You
 shouldn't be sending signals to anything but the parent.
 
 You're also running an alpha release... which is great, we need testers...
 but your report sounds like you're unfamiliar with how apache works.

 I suppose I should have said "are there any relevant error messages in
 your error log, and please don't send me 2.5Mb worth of logs".  :-/
 
 You didn't answer my other questions.  Do you understand how Apache works?
 It *always* preforks servers, there are always more than one httpd running.
 
 How many httpds do you have running?  Please send:
 
 ps -auxww | grep httpd
 
 And please send the output of /server-status, you may need to compile in
 mod_status and enable /server-status in your .conf files.

 P.S. Please don't send them if it's over 100k or so, everything you send to
 this alias is archived and sent to a dozen people... 2.5 Mb hurt.
