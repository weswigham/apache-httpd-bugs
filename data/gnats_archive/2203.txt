I have a problem with logresolve.

When I look at the statistics I got 53 not resolved names.

logresolve Statistics:
Entries: 5544
    With name   : 1
    Resolves    : 5543
    - Not found : 53
Cache hits      : 5489
Cache size      : 54
Cache buckets   :     IP number * hostname
    3    195.207.1.112 : Host not found
    8    195.207.1.117 : Host not found
   10    195.207.1.119 : Host not found
   13    193.74.240.18 : Host not found
   18    195.207.1.127 : Host not found
   21    195.207.1.130 : Host not found
   23    193.190.148.4 : Host not found
   31    195.207.1.140 : Host not found
   31  137.113.192.101 : Host not found
   33     12.65.160.52 : Host not found
   35      194.7.15.75 : Host not found
   41    195.238.9.111 : Host not found
   44       195.95.4.6 : Host not found
   47      209.1.32.61 : Host not found    
......

But when I do a nslookup from that same machine to e.g. 
> 209.1.32.61
Server:  nsip1.coi.be
Address:  192.168.77.11

Name:    ptest1.inktomi.com
Address:  209.1.32.61
                      
I got a name. Any idea what the problem is?

State-Changed-Why:
An IP number may not be resolved into a hostname immediately;
DNS is a fairly fuzzy protocol, and what may at first be a 
failure may eventually succeed.  Chances are, if you ran 
logresolve the first time and then did the nslookup, and then
ran logresolve a second time, it would get that hit.  I believe
nslookup waits around for an answer longer, too.  The 
downside is that because there is an internal cache in 
logresolve, if the answer does come to the named cache a little
bit later logresolve won't see it because it won't ask 
named a second time for an unresolved IP.

My suggestion would be, if resolving as many hostnames as
possible is your goal, that you run a logfile through 
logresolve twice; maybe even separated by several hours to 
try and deal with temporary errors.
