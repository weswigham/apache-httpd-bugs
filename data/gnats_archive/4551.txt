Hello,

First, I want to apologize if this is not the correct place to ask these
questions, but it appears that this particular function is not working
as the documentation says it should. No one would answer my postings on
the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix

Please let me know if there is a better place to get help with these
kind of problems and I will certainly abide by whatever rules you have.

Here is my current issue :

I have an apache server with quite a few name based virtual host
entries. The virtual hosts are able to execute cgi scripts, and I wish
to use the RLimitNPROC to limit the number they can have running at a
single time.

The script runs setuid root (I know about the security implications, but
it is a wrapper, and needs to run as root). It starts and then changes
itself to the appropriate userID and continues to completion.

 The server is not running as root, or the userID.

 The virtual host configuration I have looks like this :

 <VirtualHost 209.132.1.202>
     ServerName domain.com
     DocumentRoot /Interfaces/path/Server/Documents
     <Directory /Interfaces/path/Server/Documents>
         AllowOverride All
     </Directory>
     RLimitNPROC 4 8
 </VirtualHost>

 The normal web server works as it should, but it just doesn't appear
that the rlimit is preventing too many scripts from that user to run.

 Do I need to compile anything special into apache ?

 I am running 1.3.6 on Solaris 2.6 with all current patches, and any
help would be appreciated.

 Tim.
