>Description:
I downloaded the Apache1.3.9-win32.exe and installed on NT. But I found there is no Apache service entry. So I tried to uninstall it and failed. An error message occurred: "the log file 'C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\uninst.isu' is not valid or the data has been corrupted. Uninstallation will not continue." Please help me. Thank you.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 14 22:23:33 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Installation of the package (Apache distribution) does not
create a service.  You must use the command apache -i or
the icon in the Apache start menu.  You must not be running
Apache as a console or service to successfully uninstall.
