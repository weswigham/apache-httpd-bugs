>Description:
The server does not respond with a NOT FOUND message if you access
any site using apache server software with a "/" at the end of the main URL using index.htm or index.html (depends on the site)

if you try this -> http://www.apache.org/index.html/
you will not get a NOT FOUND message, you will get the page, but without images.
I am not sure if this is a bug, but I think it is not normal

State-Changed-When: Sat Oct 10 20:12:27 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
That is expected and useful behavior when accessing a page
parsed by mod_include.

Just like you can add extra path info on the end of CGIs that
the CGI can use for doing things, so can mod_include parsed
documents.
