AIX 4.1.4.0  using binary obtained from www.apache.org
>Description:
I have tried several times to download and run Apache 1.2.5 on AIX4.1.4.0.

I have configured httpd.conf, srm.conf, and access.conf, then I follow this instruction (my directories are set up the same)

Rather than running though I get the following message:

 setgroups: Invalid argument

I haven't been able to get past this point.

Thanks

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure that is the _exact_ error message you are
getting?  

What is your Group directive set to in your config file?
Does that group exist?  Try setting it to "nobody".
