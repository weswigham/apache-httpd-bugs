Windows 98 Upgrade
>Description:
After successfully installing and running Apache (it will serve local pages), the console will accept no keyboard input. I noticed if I start Apache from the command prompt that after exiting (using <Ctrl> <C> *from the keyboard*) that all my keyboard input shows up following the "DOS" prompt in the remaining DOS window...I'm a really new (hopeful) user of Apache so if this turns out to be the most really Dumb bug report in the whole universe, try to be kind.

State-Changed-Why:
If I understand you correctly, this is expected behavior.
When Apache is started through a DOS window, it takes up
the existing console until Apache stops running. Try starting
Apache from the Start menu or just use a separate DOS window
to start Apache

 Sorry but you did not understand correctly.....possibly my fault for trying
 yo keep it simple but to reiterate: It does not really make any difference
 ow you try to run Apache under WIN98 the results are that the console
 accepts no input.....
