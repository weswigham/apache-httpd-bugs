>Description:
This was reported in a previous bug report in a beta, but the resolution status is "feedback" and the solution is non-optimal. With HostNameLookup set to yes, the log is often giving me just the first number in a dotted quad or the hostname portion of a fully qualified domain names. It's erratic: I sometimes get the FQDN in a subsequent hit. I'm running BIND 4.9.4 - updating to 8.x has been problematic under our OS configuration. This problem has not occurred with Apache 1.1.x or 1.2.x at any time. If I regress to 1.2.x, logging of domain names returns to normal.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Track down whether it's a DNS/BIND resolver problem or a problem in the log-any module and either fix module or report that BIND 8.x is needed (or whatever is needed) to solve problem if you want HostNameLookups set to yes. Thanks!

 Did you link against the bind libraries explicitly?  Sunos 4.x has some
 very "interesting" ideas w.r.t. name lookup, DNS, and NIS/YP.  In
 particular, things should work fine if you use the bind libraries
 explicitly.  Or if you don't use NIS/YP.  Also take a peek in your
 /etc/hosts to see if you've got all the entries listed with the FQDN
 first.

 On the bind subject: I didn't do it explicitly, but apache is performing
 lookups in some cases, just not all. How do I link explicitly? In all the
 software I've compiled over the last four years, this hasn't been a problem
 with this OS (or I've been lucky).
 
 On the NIS/YP front: we use it, but barely. Just enough to avoid having to
 replace it, but not for any real purpose. It's set up to use DNS primarily.
 
 /etc/hosts: not sure why this affects externally looked-up FQDNs - can you
 explain? Does an FQDN in the /etc/hosts file force DNS involvement in
 resolver lookups? That seems odd.

 It depends on how you've got it installed.  If you've got the "resolv+" 
 package installed then you probably linked against it, since that modifies
 the shared libcs.  But otherwise I think you need to add -lresolv or
 something like that, it's been a long time since I've had to deal with
 sunos4.

 Yeah that's enough to cause troubles.

 It won't affect external stuff.  It'll only affect stuff that has entries
 in /etc/hosts.

 Iinstalled gcc 2.8.1 and BIND 8.1.2 and still had the problem, so I'm
 assuming the resolver library is the thing.
 
 Unfortunately, I am not sophisticated enough to figure out where to put
 -lresolv reference. The new Configuration stuff is great, but I can't
 figure out where you modify library tags like I used to. Any advice would
 be useful, as I assume other SunOS users have the potential to have this
 error, too.

 I don't use the new configuration stuff, I don't know how to do it either. 
 You can still use the old configuration stuff.  And in that, you should
 put:
 
 EXTRA_LIBS=-L/usr/local/bind/lib -lbind
 EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/bind/include
 
 Tell us how that goes...

 These flags can be added to src/Makefile after running configure and they
 get used. The executable ballooned in size:
 
 Before

 I honestly don't know what to say.  The problem doesn't happen anywhere
 except sunos 4.x, so I'd say it's a problem on that system... and there's
 not anything I know to work around it in apache... maybe you can pester
 folks on a sunos 4.x specific mailing-list/newsgroup.  Someone else has to
 have solved this issue.

 I do thank you for the time on this, and it is a bizarre one. I'm running
 CERN and Apache 1.2.x without any problems in logging on the same box. The
 problem only appeared with 1.3.0, so I was hoping there was a clear code
 change that would have caused it. I guess not! I'll poke around on
 comp.sys.sun.admin and so forth.
 
 Maybe leave this "ticket" in feedback mode so when I find a solution I can
 cc back to it and you to make sure it gets closed and logged in the
 database.

 One related point, too, before I forget: it may not be a BIND problem per
 se, as the first number in a dotted quad is being used, too, not just the
 host name without an FQDN. If it were just the latter, I could log IPs, but
 the IPs are also broken: just 204 instead of 204.94.44.1. I'll dig through
 the code again, too, and see if I can find something wrong. Hopefully,
 someone else will report this - and be a Sun developer with a solution!

 Ack.  Barf.  I'm sorry to make you go through so much work.  It turns out
 the problem is elsewhere completely... mod_usertrack was corrupting the
 hostname... which explains exactly the behaviour you saw -- when it
 generates a new cookie it corrupts the hostname.  Subsequent requests
 include the cookie, so the code doesn't corrupt the hostname. 
 
 Try this patch.

 Installing the revision 1.34 patch did it! No problems. Removing the bind
 library includes reduced the binary back to reasonable size, too (about
 500K, which is unbelievably small for how much it does).
 
 Thanks so much for the help! You can close this ticket.

 Sorry, I was wrong about one thing. The code change in user track now makes
 visit cookies (Apache=) that weren't in the same format as 1.2. In 1.2,
 just the first part (hostname or first number in dotted quad) were
 concatenated with the tick counter. But with this code change, the logging
 now works (I see how those two issues are related) but the cookie contains
 the entire FQDN or IP number.

 That was a deliberate change... it shouldn't break anything, the cookie
 value is just an opaque token that's supposed to differ from one client to
 another.  Is it causing you trouble?

 By "new Configuration stuff" I assume you mean the ./configure script.
 That's an alternate method, not a replacement for what you're used
 to using.  You can still modify your Configuration file and then
 do a "./Configure; make" to build the server - that hasn't changed.
