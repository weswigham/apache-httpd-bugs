SunOS axil 5.5 Generic sun4m sparc
Gcc 2.7.8
SSL + PHP3 + Frontpage
>Description:
Since I upgraded to 1.3.1 I noticed that the enviroment var HTTP_USER is not
on my CGI's env. Those CGI's are protected in access.conf and username/password
are asked to access it. With 1.2.6 all worked ok (same config).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Some way to force HTTP_USER to be in the env, or check carefully that the CGI
(or path the CGI is in) needs auth.

State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 28 00:51:43 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
"HTTP_USER" is not a CGI environment variable
and is not supposed to be set.  "REMOTE_USER", however,
is set, but only if you require auth for the script.  Simply
requiring auth for a form that submits to the script, etc.
is not sufficient.
