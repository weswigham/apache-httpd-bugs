>Description:
While trying to compile apache 1.3.19 + php 3.0.18 on IRIX 6.5.11m, the
compilation stopped, because of a missing #endif:

 
cc-1037 cc: ERROR File = ../apache_1.3.19/src/include/ap_config_auto.h, Line = 6
  A "#endif" directive is missing from the source file.

  #ifndef AP_CONFIG_AUTO_H
   ^

cc-1037 cc: ERROR File = ../apache_1.3.19/src/include/ap_config_auto.h, Line = 6
  A "#endif" directive is missing from the source file.

  #ifndef AP_CONFIG_AUTO_H
   ^


Sure enough, the #endif that should close the header guard #ifdef is missing.
Grep'ing the source, it would seem that src/Configure is missing the necessary
line to echo that last #endif into the generated ap_config_auto.h
>How-To-Repeat:
Try compile something that uses 1.3.19's ap_config_auto.h with a really
picky compiler.
