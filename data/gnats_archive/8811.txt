 * moddir:
 *
 *	Set the search path for modules.  This has a format similar to the

 *
 *	Example:
 *		moddir: /kernel /usr/kernel /other/modules
 
 
 
 * root device and root filesystem configuration:
 *
 *	The following may be used to override the defaults provided by
 *	the boot program:
 *
 *	rootfs:		Set the filesystem type of the root.
 *
 *	rootdev:	Set the root device.  This should be a fully
 *			expanded physical pathname.  The default is the
 *			physical pathname of the device where the boot
 *			program resides.  The physical pathname is
 *			highly platform and configuration dependent.
 *
 *	Example:
 *		rootfs:ufs

 *	(Swap device configuration should be specified in /etc/vfstab.)

 *
 *	Modules appearing in the moddir path which are NOT to be loaded,

 *	or a filename which includes the directory.

 *	Examples:
 *		exclude: win
 *		exclude: sys/shmsys
 
 
 
 * forceload:
 *
 *	Cause these modules to be loaded at boot time, (just before mounting
 *	the root filesystem) rather than at first reference. Note that
 * 	forceload expects a filename which includes the directory. Also

 try increasing the amount of shared memory on your system.
 If your running oracle, I'd hazard a guess that it is using 95% of
 your shared memory resources.
 
 try shutting down oracle and getting apache to restart. If it can
 then you need to increase the following settings in your /etc/system
 file
 
 set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax 
 set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni
 set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg
