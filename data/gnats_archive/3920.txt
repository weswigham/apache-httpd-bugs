>Description:
When different administrators start Apache, sometimes their umasks are abnormally restrictive and adversely affect CGIs such as FrontPage.  It would be nice to have apachectl hard-set the umask, or to create a "Umask" directive for Apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set umask to 077.
Start Apache.
CGIs will inherit umask.
>Fix:
The "Umask" directive I think would be the cleanest way.

State-Changed-Why:
I suggest editing your apachectl script to change the umask.
There is no one setting which we could default to which makes
sense for all systems.  For some, 022 is right, for others
002 is right.  If you've got admins using different umasks 
I think you've got other problems... what happens if they
create files as root?
