>Environment:
OpenBSD web.pacifier.com 2.2 WEB#6 i386
>Description:
Some users have had MS-DOS format (CRNL) .htaccess files; these worked under
1.2.4, while 1.3b3 produces errors and won't accept them.

[Sun Jan 11 08:20:18 1998] [alert] (2)No such file or directory: /foo/.htaccess: </Limit> takes no arguments

For example.  Removing the CRs from the file removes the error condition.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use an .htaccess file with carriage returns.
>Fix:
Ignore the carriage returns
