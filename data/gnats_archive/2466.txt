>Description:
I was testing some module development for the new server, and just put
the log directory in AFS instead of a local directory.

For some reason, this causes all the children to be completely unkillable. They
hang similarly to the way a process hung on NFS hangs. 

AFS supports fcntl locking, and in general works fine for everything else, but
something is causing this lockup.

The problem does not appear to occur with 1.2.

This isn't critical, because no one is going to run with their logs pointed into
AFS, but it does point out an potential problem.

BTW, You might consider adding WRAP=HARD WRAP=PHYSICAL to the textarea definitions
on this form.

Are you sure the problem isn't just having the lockfile
on a AFS disk?

If you use a LockFile directive to move it, does the
problem still happen?

 If anyone ever tries to tell you they have any sort of distributed file
 system with flock or fcntl locking working properly over it, Apache is a
 good test tool to verify their claims.  <g>
 
 Solaris can't cut it with NFS.  It appears that AFS can't on whatever
 platform (I forget) you are using.  The search never ends.
