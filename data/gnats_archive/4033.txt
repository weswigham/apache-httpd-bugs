>Description:
if you generate a HTTP request using the HTTP/0.9 protocol it will send a Full
HTTP/1.1 response instead of the simple response as mandated by rfc1945...
the fix is to return a simple request when you recieve a HTTP version of 0.9.

telnet somehostrunningapache 80
GET /somefile HTTP/0.9

<here is where it should dump then entity body but instead it returns a full response>
>Fix:
I haven't looked at the code, but simply don't send the headers when you recieve
a HTTP/0.9 request.

 Except that a HTTP/0.9 request, by definition, is NOT a request that says
 "GET /foo HTTP/0.9".
 
 It is arguable that perhaps you should special case things to allow the
 invalid "GET /adf HTTP/0.9" request, but... that is NOT a HTTP/0.9
 request.

 oh well, you can close it, but it doesn't matter, the spec says that
 a difference of major version numbers isn't transport compatible, and
 apache is assuming that major version 0 of http is transport compatible
 with major version 1...  it doesn't matter that it's a malformed HTTP/0.9
 request, apache shouldn't return an HTTP/1.x response as it either should
 return a simple request or return an invalid request...

 You're missing the point, I think.  It *isn't* a 'malformed HTTP/0.9
 request,' because HTTP/0.9 requests *never* have a version number.
 If anything, it's a malformed HTTP/1.0 request by virtue of having
 included the version number at all, and the malformation is an
 unrecognised version string.  In which case an HTTP/1.0 response
 is perfectly valid.  If a request doesn't include a version
 identifier, it's HTTP/0.9 by definition.  If it does, it *has*
 to be something other than HTTP/0.9.

 even though the specs say this (section 6):
 "A Simple-Response should only be sent in response [or case deleted] if
 the server only supports the more limited HTTP/0.9 protocol."
 
 > If anything, it's a malformed HTTP/1.0 request by virtue of having

 yes if I generate a request of:
 GET /somefile HTTP/1293.398
 
 then you are ligitimate in returning a HTTP/1.x response if that is
 the "highest" major version of the speficiation...  but you server
 understands the HTTP/0.9 spec, so if you recieve a request that says
 it's HTTP/0.9, you have to respond with an HTTP/0.9 response...

 where in the specification does it say that HTTP/0.9 can not generate
 a full-request?
 
 oh well, until you can state in the spec that I am not correct, I'll
 still feel the way I do...  you might as well close the pr as it
 seems that we are not going to come to an agreement... lets agree
 to disagree...
 
 and thanks for all the work on Apache... it's a great product and will
 continue to use it...

 It is made clear by implication throughout RFC 1945 that 'simple-request'
 and 'simple-response' refer to HTTP/0.9.  It is not explicitly stated,
 but there are several specific cases supporting this interpretation.
 
 RFC 1945, section 3.1:
 
    The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field
    in the first line of the message. If the protocol version is not
    specified, the recipient must assume that the message is in the
    simple HTTP/0.9 format.
 
 Contrariwise, if there *is* a version, the request is *not* in
 the simple HTTP/0.9 format.  Arguable, I suppose.. but:
 
 Section 4.1:
 
    HTTP messages consist of requests from client to server and responses
    from server to client.
 
        HTTP-message   = Simple-Request           ; HTTP/0.9 messages
                       | Simple-Response
                       | Full-Request             ; HTTP/1.0 messages
                       | Full-Response
 
 Section 5:
 
    A request message from a client to a server includes, within the
    first line of that message, the method to be applied to the resource,
    the identifier of the resource, and the protocol version in use. For
    backwards compatibility with the more limited HTTP/0.9 protocol,
    there are two valid formats for an HTTP request:
 
        Request        = Simple-Request | Full-Request
 
        Simple-Request = "GET" SP Request-URI CRLF
 
        Full-Request   = Request-Line             ; Section 5.1
                         *( General-Header        ; Section 4.3
                          | Request-Header        ; Section 5.2
                          | Entity-Header )       ; Section 7.1
                         CRLF
                         [ Entity-Body ]          ; Section 7.2
 
    If an HTTP/1.0 server receives a Simple-Request, it must respond with
    an HTTP/0.9 Simple-Response.
 
 Section 6:
 
    A Simple-Response should only be sent in response to an HTTP/0.9
    Simple-Request or if the server only supports the more limited
    HTTP/0.9 protocol.

 they implied that it should be the fact, but they then contradicted their
 implication in words which makes the implication invalid...  it's the
 statement in section 6 that is the statement the contradicts their
 implication...  if the second clause (after the or) didn't exist, I would
 completely agree with you...

 nope, go back to logic 101...  we can ONLY assume that the message is in
 the simple HTTP/0.9 format iff (if and only if) the protocol version is
 not specified...  the only other thing that we can assume in the
 contrapositive, that if the message is not in a simple HTTP/0.9 format
 that it has a version specified...  you cannot always assume that the
 converse on a statement is true...

 those are comments, they are not formal specifications...  they are
 there to help the reader understand what is going on in the text...
 
 section 2.1:
    ; comment
 
        A semi-colon, set off some distance to the right of rule text,
        starts a comment that continues to the end of line. This is a
        simple way of including useful notes in parallel with the
        specifications.

 re-read this last section, starting at if, why would you not send a
 simple-request if you only support the HTTP/0.9 spec?  this implies
 that the simple-request is NOT the only method that indicates a HTTP/0.9
 transaction...
 
 I'm glad that you finally quoted that I had been quoting and re-reading...
 
 until you quote text that SPECIFICLY states that HTTP/0.9 shall never
 send a full-request or that you CAN NOT specify a HTTP/0.9 response by
 the version field, you will never convince me...  and considering that
 I have just read the complete RFC, that will be hard to do...

State-Changed-When: Fri Mar 12 11:41:42 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:

HTTP/0.9 is the name associated with an HTTP request that
has no version information at all.  RFC 1945 does define
what that means in sections 3.1 and 5.  Regardless, any
HTTP/1.0 response is in fact a syntactically valid and
complete HTTP/0.9 response -- raw data.

Please do not continue this discussion here.  It is pointless
to argue about the theoretical implications of language
structuring in an English specification that will never be
changed again.  Suffice it to say that there is no possibility
whatsoever that Apache will be changed in response to this
concern.
