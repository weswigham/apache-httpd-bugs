>Description:
Compiled 1.3b3 from official sources with the no2slash patch, and compiler options and modules identical to the 1.3a1 previously built on the same server (same OS version).  Runs fine while load is light.  But under load (approx. 100 virtual hosts taking about 700 cumulative hits a minute), the parent and most children will suddenly die off, with a single child remaining as a zombie.  Subsequent attempts to restart httpd fail since Port 80 is already bound by the zombie child.  Prior to the collapse, odd behavior is noticed, such as references to a particular virtual host end up bringing up a totally different virtual host site, or there is a failure to connect at all.  A reboot is necessary to get the server back up, but will eventually collapse again with exact same state.  No core file to be found.

We can reproduce it just fine by running it, which we don't do anymore! :-)  I'm sure you may have suggestions for items (module lists, etc.).  Please ask for anything you need and I'll be happy to assist.

 Are you using NFS?
 
 Are you using more than one Listen directive?

 Where is your ServerRoot?  If it is NFS mounted, you should move it to a
 local directory using the LockFile directive (eg. LockFile
 /var/run/accept.lock).
 
 If this isn't the case or don't help, there are a few other things to try.

 Yes, but USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT was broken with 1.3a1.  It was fixed
 in b2.

 Comment out the USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT bit from the section
 appropriate to your OS in src/main/conf.h. 
 
 You could also try using 1.3b2 to help narrow down where the difference
 comes in...
 
 Are you _sure_ the child is a zombie?  If the parent is dead, it shouldn't
 be.  What releveant processes and info does a ps -axlw show? 
 
 Nothing in the error log?
 
 Are you sure you aren't running low on file descriptors?  Unlikely
 anything should change between a1 and b3, but...

 Marc, I've recompiled without the above #define and just restarted the
 server with fingers crossed.  I'm calling this the "modified 1.3b3".
 
 > Are you _sure_ the child is a zombie?  If the parent is dead, it shouldn't

 Yes, it was a zombie.  Could not kill it with a -9, no matter what,
 and it's parent PID was 1.
 
 When I was running the "virgin" 1.3b3, top indicated that most of the
 httpds were in a "lockf" state.  With the modified 1.3b3, most seem to
 be in select, accept, or sbwait states, ala 1.3a1.  Haven't seen a
 lockf yet.

 Here are just the interesting items (this is the virgin version):

 This run shows the short-lived server before I put 1.3a1 back up.  The
 last few lines were due to the zombie child not going away.
 
 Now running the "modified" 1.3b3, I still see the "mmap_handler" error
 messages showing up.  I see one appear in the log about every few
 minutes (and right now the server is only taking about 100 hits a
 minute as it's 2:50AM).  What's that mean?
 
 > Are you sure you aren't running low on file descriptors?  Unlikely

 Pretty sure.  /etc/login.conf has all the resources jacked way up --
 shouldn't be a problem.
 
 I'll let this modified 1.3b3 run for now until it acts up (hopefully
 it won't).  Are there any kinds of lines in the error log you're
 particularly interested in?  There's a lot of junk (File not found,
 etc.) which is why we normally run it with error logging directed to
 /dev/null.

 On most systems using serialized accept()s is a performance win.  On
 recent FreeBSD 2.2 releases, you probably get a small performance win by
 not using serialized accepts.  The difference should be quite small under
 the moderate loads you are seeing.
 
 More importantly, if you use multiple Listen directives then you need some
 sort of accept() locking or things can choke.  If you don't, no worry.
 
 I'm unsure why you would be seeing this problem with
 USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.  I will have to think about that one.

 Are you sure you aren't running out of processes or file handles?
 login.conf can trick you very easily.
 
 What does a "ulimit -a" from the shell where you start Apache show?

 But was its state 'Z'?  A zombie shouldn't have a ppid of 1.

 Correct.  lockf is what happens when it is doing the serialized accept()
 locking.

 Not really.
 
 Note that in 1.3b2 and later you can use the LogLevel directive to specify
 what level of error messages you want to see in the error log.

 The server has been running since I last wrote to you with this
 modification, and have not witnessed the behavior we had seen
 immediately before with a virgin 1.3b3 (network alarms and pagers
 going off, stuck children, etc).  By removing that #define, is this a
 performance hit?  Or just the opposite?  I can't tell if this is a
 good thing or bad.
 
 However, the error log file still shows many "mmap_handler" failures,
 and more disturbingly periodic rashes of "resource temporarily
 unavailable - unable to spawn child process" when exec'ing a CGI.
 Server was handling about 500 hits a minute at the time, with about 45
 active children.  Basically loafing along with 106 virtual hosts.

 Marc,
 
 The modified 1.3b3 (no serialized accepts) has been running now for
 two days with none of the earlier behavior we saw.  However, the spate
 of errors due to not being able to spawn CGI child processes has
 pushed it over the top again.
 
 I got several calls and email from customers, and pages from our
 office about "Error 500 - Internal Server Errors", checked the error
 log, and noticed the "resource temporarily unavailable, unable to
 spawn child process" on CGIs, just barreling in.  At the time, the
 entire process table had only 151 entries and the web server was
 taking 400 hpm.  Nothing out of the ordinary.
 
 I restarted httpd and the errors subsided immediately, and yet the
 load on the server is exactly the same.  So something is happening
 internally to the httpd server itself that is causing it to not be
 able to exec CGIs (or think it can't anyway).
 
 I'm going back to 1.3a1 until we get that figured out.  Awaiting
 further instructions for testing.
