>Description:
Summary: the configure script for Apache JServe seems to test for the apxs 
executable in a directory that apache 1.3.4 (at least) doesn't create
(at least not if --prefix is specified).

I installed apache 1.3.4 using the configure script with the options
--with-layout=Apache" \
"--prefix=/opt/apache" \
"--datadir=/export/apache/home" \
"--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE" \
"--enable-module=so

I then issued make;make install;/opt/apache/bin/apachectl start
and tested the installation: joy.

I then immeadiately attempted to configure Apache-JServ with the option 
--with-apache-install=/opt/apache 
configure murmered along, then failed with the message 
"configure: error:  does not have DSO support"

Investigation revealed that configure was looking for the apxs binary in 
${with-apache-install}/sbin, whereas the apache 3.4 installation had placed 
said binary in ${with-apache-install}/bin (I had no /opt/apache/sbin directory).

To workaround, I made sbin as a softlink to bin.
>How-To-Repeat:
any attemp to configure Apache JServ against apache 3.4 where apache is not
installed in /usr/local/apache should fail, unless I did something horribly stupid.
