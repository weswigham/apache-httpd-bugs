>Description:
root@freedom:/tmp/apache_1.3.19# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
[Tue May 15 16:14:22 2001] [alert] httpd: Could not determine the server's
fully qualified domain name, using 213.229.39.130 for ServerName
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started


when i looked in /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log i found this:

apc_shmcreate: shmget(0, 33554431,914) failed: Invalid argument
apc_shmcreate: shmget(0, 33554431,914) failed: Invalid argument
apc_sem_create: semget(0,...) failed: No space left on device
apc_sem_create: semget(0,...) failed: No space left on device


looks like a serious memory management problem
>How-To-Repeat:
install apache + php4 + mod_ssl on a solaris_x86 box
>Fix:
nope sorry

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Thu May 17 04:34:16 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The failing routines (apc_shmcreate, apc_sem_create) aren't
part of base apache.  Could they be in PHP or mod_ssl?Regardless, it is a configuration problem.

shmget() is failing because the apache module (whatever it is) wants a bigger shared memory segment (33 million bytes) than your Solaris system is configured to allow.

Look at the Solaris documentation for the /etc/system variable shmsys:shminfo_shmmax.  That will need to be
tuned to allow a larger shared memory segment.

semget() is failing because the system is out of semaphores.  Look at the documentation of semsys:seminfo_semmni and semsys:seminfo_semmns.

Another tack...  maybe the module has choices on how it gets shared memory or semaphores and you can tell it to use a different mechanism?

There may be documentation for PHP or mod_ssl (or whatever) which tells how to deal with these problems.

Thanks for using Apache.
