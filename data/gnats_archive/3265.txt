AIX 4.3
Java V 1.1.6
Apache Web Server v1.3.2
IBM WebSphere Application Server v1.1 w/ Apache 1.3.2 plug-in 
C Set ++ Compiler for AIX
>Description:
I am trying to install a stand-alone non-virtual host configuration on standard
port 80.  The standard install of Apache works fine.  The install of IBM WebSphere
Application Server v1.1 we think installs fine.  I am having trouble installing
mod_app_serv_b1.o.  I followed the complete readme.txt file for the plug-in and
get the following message when trying to run /usr/local/sbin/httpd:

Syntax error on line 262 of /usr/local/apache/etc/srm.conf:
Invalid Command 'NcfservletConfig', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
# 


Line looks like the following in the /usr/local/apache/etc/srm.conf

NcfservletConfig ncf.jvm.properties /usr/lpp/IBMWebAS/properties/server/servlet/servletservice/jvm.properti
es


>How-To-Repeat:
I do not know - try installing WebSphere with beta plugin?
>Fix:
I do not know how.

State-Changed-Why:
This is something you have to take up with IBM; we can't help
you.

It appears like, for whatever reason, you haven't properly
configured your server to include the required module.

Comment-Added:
I agree 100% with Marc in that I do not think you have
enabled the WAS module with the LoadModule/AddModule directive
ALso please direct Webshpere Application Server questions
to the Forum @
http://www.networking.ibm.com/was/forum.html
Thanks for using Apache
