>Description:
	Given the settings:
<Directory /home/www/html>
Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
AllowOverride Indexes
(... text removed ...)
</Directory>

	Placing the following in an .htaccess in a directory with or without
an index.html file results in a 500 Internal Server Error:
Options +Indexes
>How-To-Repeat:
Information provided above.
>Fix:
AllowOverride should report "illegal override option" if Indexes can not be
used in this sense (which would kill what I'm trying to do). 
Or the server should allow .htaccess files to override a subset of the
Options directive

State-Changed-Why:
As documented this is correct.  "AllowOverride Indexes" only
allows the various mod_dir functions to be overridden.  It
doesn't allow the actual Options Indexes to be overridden.  If
you look in your error_log you'll see something like:

access to /home/www/src/apache/htdocs/test/.htaccess failed for bluelark.hotwired.com, reason: Options not allowed here

So you would have to AllowOverride Options Indexes to achieve
this.

Thanks for using Apache!
