State-Changed-Why:
Yes, we discovered that problem under Solars the other
day.  It appears to be due to some obscene Solaris behavior.
A temporary workaround is to add -DNO_SLACK to the
EXTRA_CFLAGS line in Configuration, rerun Configure
and recompile.  We are thinking about the best way to
deal with this.

Comment-Added:
One other workaround is to use -USR1 instead of -HUP.
This does a graceful restart.  See the docs for details;
it is not applicable in all situations since it doesn't
immediately close the logfiles, but can be used in some.

We also have a patch available which fixes this bug without disabling
the new slack fd feature.  You can get it at

Comment-Added:
If you applied that last patch you should reverse it (use patch -R
or unpack apache_1.2.1 again and retrieve http_main.c).  Then
try applying the patch at:

http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/apply_to_1.2.1/solaris_dup.patch

(note the last one was called solaris_hup.patch).
