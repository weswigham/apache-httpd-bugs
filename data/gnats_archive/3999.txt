>Unformatted:
My Jserv installation is made by checking the 
"Integrated"radio-button because trying to install the "Custom" one 
with all options checked (included Apache Module), the Apache Web 
Server doesn't start (error by NT4 visible in event viewer).
What is the exact use of  this module?
Best Regards
Raul
