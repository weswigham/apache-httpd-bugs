 AUGUST 1, 2000
 
 Home schooling families have an enormous appetite for solid and safe educational resources. 
 Unfortunately finding those safe resources takes the kind of time and effort that few home schooling 
 families can afford to give. That is what this e-Zine is about! We want home schooling families to 
 have access to the finest educational resources available with just the click of a mouse. Our goal is 
 to serve the home schooling family; to make your endeavor a successful and enjoyable one and to 
 provide you with up-to-date articles and outstanding educational web sites.

 4 - Let's Get Motivated! by Tamara Eaton
 While some children are more naturally self-motivated than others, all have some degree of inner 
 motivation (although it may not be obvious at first). All children also need training to help them
