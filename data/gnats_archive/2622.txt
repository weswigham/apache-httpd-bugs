>Description:
The (top-level) configure script (and the top-level Makefile.tmpl) do
not provide a --suexec-docroot=directory_path_goes_here option. I'd
find it convenient. (Otherwise suexec uses the default /usr/local/apache/htdocs.

State-Changed-Why:
Its not quite correct that it uses
/usr/local/apache/htdocs for DOC_ROOT. It uses
the DocumentRoot for which Apache itself is
build, i.e. per default <datadir>/htdocs/.
And this _is_ a reasonable setup. Because you
already can change it by using --datadir.
Sure, that's not exactly what you want but
as long as we don't provide a --docroot
option there is no need to also provide a
--suexec-docroot option IMHO. But the
--docroot option can be useful, yes. I've
added it to my TODO list and perhaps I add
support for this into Apache 1.3.2 when I find time.
Nevertheless thanks for the hint.
