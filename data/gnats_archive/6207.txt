>Description:
I got the latest php4 version (4.0.0), before that I used php3 and it worked. 
If I use php4 in a DOS-box it works (I tried it with a simple functioncall of
the phpinfo() function) and php4 is giving me back a lot of htmlcode, so I think
it works. If I start the Apache and run a php4Script I get the 500 Internal Server
Error. I think I did the configuration correctly (just changed the MIME-types
from php3 to php4). If I replace just the pp.exe (version3 instead of 4, everything 
is okay again.) I will also ask the php-developers for help and will inform you
if it should be a php-bug. Thanks in advance!
