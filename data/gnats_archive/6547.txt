>Release:        1.3.12
>Organization:
>Environment:
Win NT4.0 WS SP6a, build 1381
>Description:
Often, when a request is made, either from local or a remote client for a file, a CGI script or a servlet using either GET or POST, the server often doesn't reply.  Usually repeating the request with generate a response.

There is no eveidence of the dropped requests in the error or access log files.

I am also running JServ 1.1.2 but this has been a problem before its installation.

This problem did not occur immediately after Apache's initial installation of 1.3.11 but started well after upgrading to 1.3.12.  Of course, I have tried reinstalling 1.3.12 with no success.
>How-To-Repeat:
My site is running at http://www.mcneelyfamily.org.  Simply follow some links such as the online documentation and note that at times, a response is not sent.

>Fix:
Unless this is something you've ran across before, I think it may be an NT problem and I need to reload the OS but I'd rather get your opinions before doing that.

Note: I have reloaded the service pack.

Comment-Added:
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/

Note the most recent WinNT service packs are required to
avoid some previous, serious WinSock problems.
