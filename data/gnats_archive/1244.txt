>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0, MSVC++ 5.0,
>Description:
CGI module is opening pipe to subprocess in text mode.  This makes it 
hard to have CGI programs which parse arbitrary binary data.

"Text mode" is one of those horrible characteristics of the runtime library on Windows, and IMHO, should be avoided.

>How-To-Repeat:
Make a dummy CGI program that reads in the raw info (quantity specifed in content length.)  Then write an http client that posts binary data, and 
make sure the binary data includes a newline (0x0a) character.  The CGI 
will see the newline substituted with CR LF (0x0d, 0x0a)

>Fix:

I'm working on a fix, but I'm not super-expert on Apache code, so 
I don't know what else it might break.  I'm trying to simple 
change the pipe that is created to be opened _O_BINARY instead of
_O_TEXT.
