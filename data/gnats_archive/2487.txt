>Description:
This error is closely related to PR #2455, are are due to the fact, that Win32
and properly OS/2 uses case-blind file systems. This means that every line
in apache that related to file systems may be bogus, i.e <Directory>,
<Location> and many more.

The result is among other, that a file protected in location /protected can
be accessed with no problem using the partial uri /PROTECTED or any other
combination of letters.
>How-To-Repeat:
<Location /protected>
order deny,allow
deny from all
</Location>

brose the directoty /PROTECTED
>Fix:
Where there is a strcmp in the source (and that is quite a lot), the developer
have to thing of every ramifications of each use of the  comparison
function. What the major issue is ofcause the the filesystem.

 <Location> is for protecting URLs, not the filesystem.  <Directory> is for
 protecting the filesystem... and for at least non-wildcard <Directory>
 sections, there shouldn't be any problem.  (wildcard stuff is fixed in
 1.3.1-dev).
 
 See the documentation, this distinction is spelled out.  For example:
 
     Note that URLs do not have to line up with the filesystem at all, it
     should be emphasized that <Location> operates completely outside the
     filesystem.
