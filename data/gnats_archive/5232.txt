>Description:
  This may not be Apache's fault, buy maybe someone has seen it before.
The top level "make" goes through the motions of cd'ing to subdirectories
to do a "make" in each one.  The "make" in most subdirectories produces
'gcc' commands, but no actual compilation is performed.  It's as if 
"make -n" were being executed there instead of "make".
If I 'cd' manually to each subdirectory and type "make", the actual 
compilations are done.
>How-To-Repeat:
I wish I knew.
>Fix:
Manually doing all the compiles might work...
