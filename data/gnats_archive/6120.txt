>Environment:
Win 95.b
>Description:
I use Apache 1.3.9(win32), W95 and php3.0.11. I'd like to work with errordocuments. I wrote in httpd.conf directive ErrorDocument 404 some.php3. It works right. But the variable REDIRECT_STATUS is always 200. I'd like to have one (.php3) error document for all errors and I need this variable. It's possibly?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think that server doesn't initialize this variable or forget this.
