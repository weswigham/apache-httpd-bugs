>Description:
I compiled the new release 1.3.9 on Solaris 2.7 using SUN's cc compiler. That went seamless. It is up and running. But before that i tried to use our (new) default gcc compiler (GCC 2.95.1). This gave some core dumps. I'am not sure where to put this problem, at your organization or at gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org.

A llisting of the terminal in and output follows.

>How-To-Repeat:
download apache_1.3.9 and GCC_2.95.1 <ftp://nce/sun.ca/freeware/sparc/7/gcc-2.95.1-sol7-sparc-local.gz> on a Solaris 7 platform and see what happens...
>Fix:
I think gcc is doing it wrong... You will be ready quite fast.
