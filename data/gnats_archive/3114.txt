BSD/OS 2.1, 3.x
>Description:
Problem is similar to PR# 3061, but not specifically limited to <directory> or
IndexIgnore.   In srm.conf adding "IndexOptions FancyIndexing" has no effect
and continues gives <UL> index.

Problem appears isolated to Apache 1.3.2 and BSD/OS. Going back to apache 1.3.1 
fixes the FancyIndexing.  Same server config works under Linux and apache 1.3.2.

State-Changed-Why:

Do you have any other IndexOptions statements?  They
don't OR together by default, you know.  Try changing
the line to

  IndexOptions +FancyIndexing

(i.e., use the latest release and put a '+' in front of
the keyword) and see if that fixes the issue.
