>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.3 1 sun4c, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
Using a custom log format with %T to report request duration,
if a 408 timeout occurs, the %T value is displayed as the
current time, e.g. 892269879, instead of something reasonable,
like 0 or -.
>How-To-Repeat:
Force a timeout by connecting to server, but don't
send a request.
>Fix:
Nope
