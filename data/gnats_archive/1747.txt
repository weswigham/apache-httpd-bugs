Using BSDI 3.0 patched to M300-043
>Description:
Recent Apache Configuration file change: 
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  ^(.*)
RewriteRule ^/principia/(.*) /usr/local/cgi/cgi-bin/Principia/$1  [e=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]

Recent addition of software that uses Apache: Principia

Fills up the Apache error log with...
[Wed Jan 28 13:46:26 1998] [error] (35)Resource temporarily unavailable: accept: (client socket)

>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately it's not easily repeatable.
I've filed this report in hope that it might correlate it with other errors.
This may well *not* be an Apache error

 Have you tried reporting this on a BSDI specific mailing list/newsgroup?
 It's possible that you have to adjust some global system limit... like the
 number of mbufs or something like that.  I think there are bsd4.4 tuning
 docs under www.apache.org/docs/misc/ somewhere.

 I'm working on a more complete solution to this... but apache shouldn't be
 filling up your logs like that, that's nasty.  This patch should work
 around the problem for now.
