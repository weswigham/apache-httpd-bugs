Change line 1328 of http_core.c :

    if (cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token) {

#ifndef AIX
    if (cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token) {
#else
    if (strcmp(cmd->cmd->name,cmd->end_token)) {
#endif

State-Changed-Why:
No, it isn't a "weird pointer comparison", it is a very basic
bug in the compiler you are using.  Get a fixed version of your
compiler.
