>Description:
Because mod_autoindex does not generate LM headers, web caches cannot validate
these pages, making them essentially uncacheable (an Expires or a max-age can
be set, but that only does so much good; the index has to be re-downloaded in
full after it expires).

Because the module already does a stat for every file that it lists, it would
be relatively easy to compute a LM based on the most recently modified file that
it knows of (including HEADER, README, etc).

State-Changed-Why:

This is not practicable.  mod_autoindex only stats every
file for FancyIndexed displays, and it doesn't scan the
directory until after it has sent the response header.
Adding the behaviour you request would require that the
file scan be completed, and the Header and Readme files
be examined but not sent, before the response header is
sent back to the client.  In the case of very large
directories this could delay the response for a significant
interval, which is not good.

There appears to be no clear way to do this with the current
design, but it would definitely be a nice feature -- so I'm
suspending this report for future consideration rather
than closing it.

 I see your point. It's interesting; autoindex also doesn't send a
 Content-Length header, which rules out persistent connections (with both
 caches and browsers). I wonder where the break point between the cost of
 processing everything and the network benefits of full metainformation is?
 The gains made by persistance are fairly well-researched. What portion of a
 particular resource's client population comes through a cache is more
 slippery, but would be considerable for popular ones.
  
 A possible implementation might stat the directory to decide if it's small
 enough to justify the cost of computing the headers, or allow the user to
 configure whether they want them sent (possibly something like
 AutoIndexGenMeta or somesuch, defaulting to true, allowing people with very
 large directories to turn it off).
 
 Just something to think about (as if you guys don't have enough to do ;-).
 
 Thanks,

This behavior can be enabled on 1.3.20, and is enabled by
