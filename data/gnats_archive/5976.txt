>Description:
Currently there are 3 password required directories that work fine, just tried to password protect another directory, comes up with the password required dialogue box, but entering the password does not allow access. The passwords in the user file are encrypted, encrypted the new password - no difference. Put the new password into a seperate file, a seperate encrypted file - no difference.
