Hi,

To start Apache as an service on NT, You have to use SYSTEM account.
In the control_panel/Services You must find appropriate service "Apache"
Click on "Startup" button, a new Window appears. Chose "StartUp type -
Automatic" and "Log On As - System Account" Other account generate error as
mentioned below. 

Any visitor of your WWW site uses "SYSTEM" account. Set up security for
this account.

Best wishes
