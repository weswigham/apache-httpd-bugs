>Description:
If you use apachectl, it forces you to the default conf file. This is
probably okay most of the time, but there is a very simple (2 minute)
solution that we've implemented that saves much time and aggravation.
You just add an extra variable called CONF which stores the location
of the conf file. See below...		
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The easiest way is to add this to the top of apachectl:

# the path to your conf file
CONF=/opt/apache/conf/httpd.conf
#

Then, for each of the statements that launch Apache (4 total), simply
change them to read:

        if $HTTPD -f $CONF ; then
            echo "$0 $ARG: httpd started"


So all your doing if adding the -f $CONF to the normal 'if $HTTPD ; then'
statement. Like I said, it's easy, but makes life easier a lot of times.
If you want I will be more than happy to add the necessary changes to the
source/etc so this can happen. Thanks.

P.S. Keep up the good work, Apache rocks... :-)

State-Changed-Why:

Thanks for the report, but if you notice the line above
the definition of HTTPD (which you're supposed to change),
it says "# the path to your httpd binary, including
options if necessary".  That's where you're supposed to
add the '-f' or '-d' flags.

Was you apachectl file created/modified by ./configure?
Or are you using the default one from the download package?
