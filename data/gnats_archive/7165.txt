Apache 2a8 compiled in Debug Mode with VC++ 6 on Windows 2000 SP1
>Description:
My ErorrDocument 404 handler points to a cgi script. If the CGI script can not be spawned (invalid #!) the error log writes: 

[Sun Jan 28 21:33:12 2001] [error] [client 0.0.0.0] (22003)The system cannot fin
d the path specified.  : couldn't create child process: 22003: c:/personal/site/
cgi-bin/error404.cgi
[Sun Jan 28 21:33:12 2001] [error] [client 0.0.0.0] couldn't spawn child process
: c:/personal/site/cgi-bin/error404.cgi

though apache returns the following answer:

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Mon, 29 Jan 2001 05:30:45 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0a8 (Win32)
Content-Length: 0
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

This causes havoc with Browsers - IE displays DNS error (as if it can't connect to the site). Netscape does a little better - it reports 404 - Not found and then hangs seemingly waiting for something.

Btw, if you try and run the CGI defined in the ErorrDocument Apache retyurns the proper 500 page
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the ErorrDocument 404 to a cgi that doesn't run because of #!...
