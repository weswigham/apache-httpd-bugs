Windows 98 SE
Apache v1.3.9 (Win98 Binary Distribution)
>Description:
After opening a DOS-Box from a Script (PHP3/CGI) the server hangs up and give an failure-reply after 2 minutes whichs means that the current site couldn't be found. 
I tried it with varius commands under PHP3 (exec,passthrough,etc) and under Perl/CGI with the command (system). 
This failure doesn't even happen on "normal" Windows 98. Only with Windows 98 SE ist appears.
