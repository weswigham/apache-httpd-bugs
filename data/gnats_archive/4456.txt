>Description:
See 'reproducing problem' section, below.
>How-To-Repeat:
For example, set MaxClients higher than HARD_SERVER_LIMIT in httpd.conf.
Then, add an ErrorLog "|while read foo ; do true ; done" directive.
Start apache.
Watch Fireworks.
>Fix:
continue using the old configuration until the new has been
completely parsed?
