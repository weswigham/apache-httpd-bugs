>Description:
I have the same problem as PR#2027, #2371, #2376, #2809 which are NOT solved yet.

I compiled 1.3.0, 1.3.1 and the old 1.2.1 in the same system with the same gdbm
1.7.3.  However, the apache 1.2.1 works fine, but the newer ones don't.  I believe that the problem should be in Apache source code instead of the Gdbm package.

State-Changed-Why:
Please give more details. How was the DBM file generated?
Is it the same DBM file used with 1.2.1? Are you sure that
that Apache 1.3 isn't getting linked with some other DBM
library on your system instead, such as NDBM?

 Hi,
 
     thanks for your prompt reply!  I did check the Configuration file and
 removed -lgdbm in EXTRA_LIBS.
 And it works.  I don't have time to figure out why.  But as long as it
 works,  I am happy now.
 
     Thanks again!
 
 Terry Chang
