>Environment:
NT 4.0 service pack 4 (pre-compiled binary of apache 1.3.6)
>Description:
Every time I try to start apache as a service, I get error # 2186: The service is not responding to the control function.

I had tried moving Apache to C:/Apache to try to avoid any whitespace in the command line, but it didn't help.

Also, how come there's documentation for a '-n' option, but it's not built into
the binary?
>How-To-Repeat:
Run it on NT 4.0 sp4
>Fix:
I shouldn't use a half-assed OS! (Damn work forces me!)

State-Changed-Why:
The -n option will be added with v1.3.7. I will update the
doc to make note of this. 

Try starting apache directly from the command line. If it
doesn't start from the command line, fix the problem then 
try starting as a service again.

Is Apache installed on a network mounted drive?  If so, try 
configure the service to run under an ID that has access to
the drive. The local system account does not 
have access to network services.
