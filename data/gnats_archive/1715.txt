PR#1030 modified bug when CGI is binary executable,
but it not modified CGI is '#!' script.

if you access URL such like:
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/perlscript&arg1+arg2+arg3
when $SERVERROOT/cbi-bin/perlscript.cgi content is:
  #!/usr/local/bin/perl
  ...

apache 1.3b3 for WIN32 spawn
  /usr/local/bin/perl arg1 arg2 arg3
but, proper action is
  /usr/local/bin/perl perlscript.cgi arg1 arg2 arg3
>How-To-Repeat:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/perlscript.cgi&arg1+arg2+arg3

perlscript.cgi:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
...
>Fix:
apache_1.3b3/src/main/util_script.c:769

change line 769 as follows:

	    else if (is_script) {
		pid = spawnve(_P_NOWAIT, interpreter + 2,
			      create_argv(r->pool, NULL, NULL, NULL,
					  r->filename, r->args), env);
	    }

to:
	    else if (is_script) {
		pid = spawnve(_P_NOWAIT, interpreter + 2,
			      create_argv(r->pool, r->filename, NULL, NULL,
					  r->filename, r->args), env);
	    }
