gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
>Description:
I'd like to be able to set the time zone used by flastmod to something other
than my local time zone. I have apps specific to clients in other time zones
and I'd like to make flastmod meaningful for them. The command 
"SetEnv TZ EST5EDT" doesn't seem to affect flastmod.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
A new <!--#config timezone=value --> does a putenv("TZ", value) ??
