>Environment:
RedHat Linux 5.1, glibc
>Description:
RFC 2068 (HTTP/1.1), section 5.2 ( page 37 ) gives the rules
for identification of resources.  With regards to the Host: header it says
that:

"If the Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the Request-URI.
Any Host header field value in the request MUST be ignored."

Apache requires the Host: header field even though it is required to be
ignored.  It will return a 400, Bad Request response.

Additionally, if the Host: header is invalid, the URI given is apparently
parsed incorrectly.

Three examples are given.  The first is without a Host: header, the second
has a Host: header that is different than the URI which gives a bizarre
response and the third is a successful response as a contol.  Please feel
free to contact me if you require further information.  Thanks!

State-Changed-Why:
The Host request header field is always required for
all HTTP/1.1 requests.  From section 14.23 of RFC2068:

   A client MUST include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request
   messages on the Internet (i.e., on any message corresponding to a
   request for a URL which includes an Internet host address for the
   service being requested). If the Host field is not already present,
   an HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST add a Host field to the request message prior
   to forwarding it on the Internet. All Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers
   MUST respond with a 400 status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message
   which lacks a Host header field.

   See sections 5.2 and 19.5.1 for other requirements relating to Host.

The header field must always be present.  Its value may
be ignored, but it cannot be omitted.

The Apache Web server is doing exactly what it is required
to do.  Thanks for using it!

Comment-Added:
Sorry, I missed addressing the middle portion of your
report (one reason why we request one issue per report).

The parsing of the absoluteURI and its interaction with
the Host: header field was fixed for Apache 1.3.0.
Please consider upgrading.
