FreeBSD 2.2.1-RELEASE, however, all operating systems may be affected
under heavy load.
>Description:
In the file buff.c you have removed three lines of code that cause
detremental effects (server hanging because it's out of file
descriptors) after a period of time depending on your configuration.
The "note_cleanups_for_fd" lines apparently were accidentally removed
in the latest beta of your server software.  Adding these lines back
in appears to fix the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run a heavily loaded webserver for 2-6 hours (depending on your
configuration) and things will start to die...
>Fix:
In file buff.c procedure 'bpushfd' add the following back in:
note_cleanups_for_fd(fb->pool, fb->fd);
if (fb->fd != fb->fd_in)
  note_cleanups_for_fd(fb->pool, fb->fd_in)%3

State-Changed-Why:
At the same time that change was made we also put note_cleanups_for_fd
calls into all the code that used bpushfd().  The change was
needed to make the proxy work properly.  So I'm guessing you've
got a non-standard module built in, and it needs that change made
as well.  Is that right?

Out-of-band discussion cleared this one up, we just forgot
