Windows NT Workstation 4.0 with SP3
>Description:
I'm see the same problem described in #2692. The problem is really with
Live Software's JRun for Apache. It's jrun.dll library is trying to import
the function ap_get_module_config from ApacheCore. This worked with 1.3.0, and
I wouldn't expect a point change to alter something like this. Especially since
I didn't see anything in the CHANGES file pertaining to this (at least that I
could tell).

Can you give me any work around? Or tell me where I might find the old windows
installer file for 1.3.0, I've deleted my copy of it and can't switch back.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug  4 11:33:10 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Because of the way DLLs work, this will not work with 1.3.1.
Sorry, we really can't make the 1.3.0 binary available anywhere
for download.

You should contact the vendor of your software and get them
to release an updated version.
