mod_perl 1.21
perl 5
Windows 95 for use browsers: Mozilla 4.5 and Microsoft Explorer 5.0
>Description:
Using Mozilla 4.5 a button on a certain webpage is clicked to start a perl CGI script. This goes via the Javascript statements:
document.form.action = "...  .pl";  (perl script path/filename bv. create.pl)
document.form.method = "POST";
document.form.submit();
These statements are executed one time, but the perl script is mostly started twice. In the error logfile of Apache the lines are written twice.
Using MSIE 5.0 the perl script is always started one time and thus no problem. 
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem is very clear, thus I hope somebody with the experience or the  knowledge can help me!
>Fix:
No idea.

State-Changed-Why:
Umh... if a particular version of Mozilla is not doing what
you expect, then maybe your javascript is doing something wrong
or there is a bug in mozilla.  Either way, there is nothing
that Apache can do about it... it just serves what the client asks for.  If the client asks twice...
