WinNT 4.0/Service Pack 3/Apache installed as Service
>Description:
This appears to be relevant to the existing report PR#1558, or at least it's
very close to the same problem.

After installing Apache 1.3.0 on NT 4.0/SP3, running a P90/32Meg with IIS
disabled, I noticed that if I pointed an Alias in the .srm conf file to a
drive physically on another machine on my internal network, the images I
was pointing to would not display when I viewed the page from a third machine,
through the server url's. (i.e. Alias /images/ "d:/inetpub/wwwroot/")

Not too worried about it at the time, since I had installed Apache on this
box to solve another problem in entirety, I fixed my initial problem and
returned to this one. Sometime in my fiddling and playing with the server
I had somehow gotten this to work, the images were now displaying correctly
in my documents.

After thinking about what I did, I figured out that if the Apache server
is loaded automatically as a service when NT starts up, it is unable to see
in the needed manner the drive on the "other" machine in the network that
the Alias points to. Even after a user is logged on locally and his usuing
that drive connection, thus the tree being in memory and available.

To test this I stopped the version that was running as a system service,
and opened a DOS window, went to the \apache directory (where it is installed)
and ran the .exe from there. This worked.

Here is the output I got in my error log file:

[Sat Jun 27 23:07:32 1998] [error] File does not exist: d:/inetpub/wwwroot/images/FPCreated.gif
[Sat Jun 27 23:08:57 1998] [crit] (13)Permission denied: d:/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

The only other thing that was done in the conf files was adding Includes
to the access.conf for the directory that the HTML was in.

>How-To-Repeat:
I'm sorry I can't give you example URL's as this is an internal private
site at this time, but I will help to re-create this as best able, working
with your people if you wish.
>Fix:
I'm not that good a programmer to attack this, but the problem would seem
to lay in the file access differences between a process running as a system
service versus from a DOS prompt.

State-Changed-Why:
By default, an NT service runs in the security context of 
the LocalSystem account. The LocalSystem account does not 
have security credentials, which means, among other things,
that it cannot access shared files.

To get around his problem, you should add a new user ID to 
the NT system that is running apache, then modify the 
apache service in the services panel to start as that user.  He will then be able to access the images.
(and make sure that the new user has accesss to the files
you want to serve up).

I'll leave the PR in analyzed state for now and close it
after giving some time for comments...

[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!
