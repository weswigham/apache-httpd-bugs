>Description:
after installation of Apache 1.3.22 and Tomcat 4.0.1 (both running) i cannot find the modul ApacheModuleJServ.dll

from http://java.apache.org/jserv/install/howto.win32_install.html
....
....
Installing the web server module
The Apache web server communicates with the servlet engine using the Apache JServ module named ApacheModuleJServ.dll (found in the \bin\c directory of the distribution). This file must be copied under the \modules directory of your existing Apache installation.

After you have copied the file in the module directory, you should append the configuration template file \conf\httpd.conf to your existing Apache configuration file (usually httpd.conf). This template helps you configure the module and the web server.

The first thing to do is to uncomment the loadmodule directive to let Apache know about the new module

# Tell Apache on win32 to load the Apache JServ communication module
LoadModule jserv_module modules/ApacheModuleJServ.dll
After this, you should specify the servlet engine configuration file (usually jserv.properties) and the module log file with the directives

ApJServProperties <full path to ./conf/jserv.properties>
ApJServLogFile <full path to ./logs/jserv.module.log>
The log file will be created if not existing or logs will be appended to an existing file.

How can i get the ApacheModuleJServ.dll to integrate Jserv into the Apache Server ?

 Sorry - ApacheModuleJServ.dll deals with Apache JServ and not with Tomcat -
 this problem can be closed.
