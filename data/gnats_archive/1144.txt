DEC ALPHA / OSF 3.2c
>Description:
I have an httpd.conf wichworks perfectly with 1.2b8.
The SAME file make 1.2.4 crazy...

I have about 25 virtual servers.

here is a sample :

ServerType standalone
ServerName www.freenet.fr
<VirtualHost www.freenet.fr>
ServerAdmin web@freenet.fr
DocumentRoot /somedir/htdocs/www.freenet.fr
ServerName www.freenet.fr
ErrorLog logs/www.freenet-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.freenet-access_log
(...)
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.eole.fr>
AddHandler send-as-is .cgi
ServerAdmin web@freenet.fr
DocumentRoot /someotherdir/eole/public_html
ServerName www.eole.fr
ErrorLog logs/www.eole-error_log
TransferLog logs/www.eole-access_log
</VirtualHost>


Which are absolutely NORMAL!!

Did something changed betwen 1.2b8 and 1.2.4 in the parsing of the config files?

With 1.2.4, I could ask ANY URL, it returns me www.freenet.fr! (which is cool but not very smart ;o) )
It worked once when I put ip addresses instead of names in the <virtualhost> line, but
If I change something..it's nuts again!

I really wonder about what's going on...

May be it has something to do with mod_status but I am not sure (I had warnings at the compilations).

I have nothing in the logs.

Thanks for your reply.

>How-To-Repeat:
I could change the version of the for one or two minutes but no more... Ask me if you need. You can contact me on IRC (EFNET) as BluePatch between 9am and 18pm (GMT+1).
>Fix:
check changes between 1.2.4 and 1.2b8
and the interaction with mod_status

...I have no more clues....

Just ask me if you need more details

 Are all of your servers the same IP address?
 
 Does the htdocs/manual/vhosts-in-depth.html documentation help you at all?

 Francis I don't think I ever received a response to this question.  But
 maybe I misplaced it.
 
 In 1.2 if you want to use name-based vhosts (which yours are) then they
 all have to have the same address as the "main server".  Generally this
 means the same address as the machine itself has.
 
 vhosts have been completely rewritten in 1.3, and you may want to read the
 docs at http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/ to see how the new stuff works.
 There were so many bugs and inconsistencies in 1.1, the 1.2 betas, and the
 1.2 release regarding vhosts that we decided a complete rewrite was the
 best approach.

 What is the machine's ethernet address?  i.e. what is the ip address
 returned for a reverse lookup on the output of the hostname command?
