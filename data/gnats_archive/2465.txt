When I try executing any CGI script *.cgi or *.pl get the following error mesage
"The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your
request."

Error.log file entry

State-Changed-Why:
Does this file, "c:/zenexpre/httpd/cgi-bin/wsmsearch2.cgi",
actually exist?  What is the first line in the file?

There are known serious problems with 1.3b7 and CGI scripts,
so you should probably wait a day or two until 1.3.0 for
Win32 is released and then try again.  In the meantime,
let's try to determine the cause without the benefit of
testing (which would fail on 1.3b7).

 Yes, the file c:/zenexpre/httpd/cgi-bin/wsmsearch2.cgi exists and the
 first line is as follows
 
 #!/perl/bin/perl

Comment-Added:
If the first line of the script is:
#!/perl/blah/perl.exe
This this assumes that the perl directory of off of the root
of the same drive as Apache is.  Try giving the full path
to the perl interpreter:
#!c:/perl/bin/perl.exe

ALso make sure that the directory you have the script in
can execute scripts ( cgi-bin ) or other directory you 
have configured accordingly.
Thanks for using Apache.
ALso there are major problems with 1.3b7 and cgi on WIn32
so please upgrade to 1.3.3 before trying the above.
