>Description:
when linking to a directory, apache doesnt recognise this form:
http://www.menschenfeind.com/kommune1
BUT, when link ing in this form:
http://www.menschenfeind.com/kommune1/   ,  with the "/" at the end
it works just fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
test this directory.
http://www.menschenfeind.com/kommune1
http://www.menschenfeind.com/kommune1/
see the difference?
>Fix:
i dont know, im not a programmer, but i might have a clue?
enable apache to read /dir as a normal dir, "/dir/"

In your case, you have the ServerName set to the bogus
