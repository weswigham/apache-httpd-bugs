SunOS fgdc 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
>Description:
  I know this isn't that much of a problem compared to others, but
 I have to put up with a real pain in the a__ individual who digests and
 runs the web reports through a windows package to qualify their job.

 Have used this for many years..... and it worked before I upgraded to 1.3.2, in
 fact it did work for a short while after, when I toyed with the format in March. 
  I left it alone since then and now it looks like it just worked for a few days
and went back to the basic stuff again after a reboot or 2....
I use:
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" fgdc

all that comes out is:
212.210.101.35 - - [04/May/1999:08:48:23 -0400] "GET /gifs/search1.gif HTTP/1.1" 200 302

State-Changed-Why:

It looks like you're missing a quotation mark before the
%{Referer} element:

> LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" fgdc

Also, you don't say whether you're actually *using* this
custom format with a "CustomLog file fgdc".

If neither of the above have any effect, please try with
the latest release, 1.3.6.
