Let me know what else you need to know ...
>Description:
When accessing pages (both local and proxied) from Micro$oft's Internet Explorer 3.01
pages have a tendancy to come back with the error:

The server returned an invalid or unrecognized response

(As an example, I had to request this submission form about three times before I
actually got it.)

I just tried to telnet to port 80 of our local server and request this page manually (entering "GET http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi/send_pr? HTTP/1.0").  As soon as I entered the first line, the server closed the connection (did not wait for me to complete the MIME header or return anything).
>How-To-Repeat:
See description above.  If you need help debugging (your server won't repeat the problem) I will be happy to insert debugging printf etc. into the source I have to get you the information you need.
>Fix:
Have not dug into the code yet.  I am willing, if I have some idea where to look
