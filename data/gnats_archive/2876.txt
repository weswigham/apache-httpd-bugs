>Environment:
M$ Windows NT4 Service Pack 3
Binary release from apache.org
>Description:
Installed 1.3.1 binary from apache.org, installed as NT service.

Service fails to start "Error 05: Access denied"
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm assuming that this exists in all NT machines trying to run 1.3.1
>Fix:
Installer is broken. Default install path contains whitespace (C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache") but the value of registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Apache\ImagePath (path to apache.exe) is not double-quoted. Fix this.

Adding another pair of quotes in the registry by hand is the workaround. To accomplish:

Start -> Run -> regedit
(drill down to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Apache\ImagePath)
select ImagePath key, right-click -> Modify
add quotes around string in text box
click Close
exit regedit
It's M$, so reboot.

 I am not in a position to test for the continued existence of this bug
 at this time -- I am not a windoze user except when forced. Mine is an
 all-Unix shop. I will, however, seek out others who have reported this
 problem to me and ask if they'll lend a hand.
