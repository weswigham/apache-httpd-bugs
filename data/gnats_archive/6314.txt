>Description:
A CGI writes to stdout (perhaps a short HTML segment) closes stdout and forks a child.  The parent then exits.  The child goes off and continues processing.  Apparently, Apache is waiting for the child to exit before any output is actually sent to the browser.

Looks like apache is holding the socket open to the browser, despite the fact that both parent and child have closed STDOUT.  Only when the child exits does the connection get released.
>How-To-Repeat:
#!/usr/bin/perl

$| = 1;

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n<html><body><h1>test</h1></body></html>\n";
close STDOUT;
my $pid = fork();
if ($pid > 0) {
  exit(0);
}
else {
  close STDOUT;
  sleep(60);
  exit(0);
}

Works fine for me.  However, since you don't include basic
requested information about the version of Apache you are 
using, there is nothing we can do.
