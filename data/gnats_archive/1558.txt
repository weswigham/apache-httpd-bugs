State-Changed-Why:
This should work. Have you checked your error_log file?
(You will need to stop Apache before you can read the
error log).

Also make sure that you have a valid DirectoryIndex file, if you
are accessing /cd-rom/, or try to access a file directly
that you know exists on D:\, for example /cd-rom/myfile

State-Changed-Why:
Actually, it doesn't work. Nor will "Alias /fred /" on a Unix
box. This is because get_path_info() will strip a leading /
if the path is simply "/" or "x:/". I'm working on a fix.

Subject: Alias to other drives gives error 404

     Hello,  
           
     I am hitting problem PR1558 as well.  I have an alias  /cdrom/ f:/
     and a <directory "f:/"> defined with default options              
     and "allow from all".  If i point the alias to a valid directory
     it works.                                                        
              
     Is there any fix for this yet?
                                   
     Thanks alot for your reply.
