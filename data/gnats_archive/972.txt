State-Changed-When: Wed Aug  6 10:45:18 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
1.2b8 is not longer really supported.  It is a (quite) old
beta.  Upgrade to 1.2.1.

You say you are using a "ScriptAliased" directive?  That
directive does not exist.  There is a sample in the distributed
config files:

#ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/

Are you really trying to use ScriptAliased?

The user reports that upgrading to 1.2.1 solved their
