>Description:
I require an Apache web server to proxy to a specialized web server (IIS --yuck)
on the inside of our corporate firewall.  This works fine, however I needed to 
define authentification to restrict access by user name and password.  When I
did this, web clients get 407 errors returned to them.  Unfortunately neither 
Netscape nor IE seeme to know what to do with this response code. This problem
seems to have been similarly reported as PR#2978 but never resolved.

Here is an excerpt from my httpd.conf (IP addresses not real):

<VirtualHost 10.10.10.10:80>
  ServerAdmin  webmaster@who.int
  ErrorLog logs/intranet/error_log
  TransferLog logs/intranet/access_log
  ServerName foobar-ext.who.int
  DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html-blank
 <Directory proxy:*>
   Options None
   AllowOverride None
   <Limit GET POST>
       require valid-user
   </Limit>
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName foobarexternal
   AuthUserFile /home/httpd/conf/intranet.pwd
  </Directory>
  ProxyRequests on
  ProxyPass / http://iis.who.int/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://iis.who.int/
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteLog logs/intranet/rewrite_log
  RewriteLogLevel 3
  RewriteRule ^/$  http://iis.who.int/index.ext.html [P]
  RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://iis.who.int/$1 [P]
</VirtualHost>


Oddly, if a user accesses this proxy server thru another proxy it works.  The
user gets challenged properly.  i.e.:

client <-> client proxy <-> Apache Proxy <-> IIS Server

I suppose the client proxy knows how to deal with the 407 error.

Help! I needed to get this working yesterday.

Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up 2 web servers.  Have one proxy the other using the above <VirtualHost>
Section.  Netscape reports 407 Proxy Authentification required.  IE4 reports
Not Enough memory to complete operation	
>Fix:
Can we simply have Apache return a standard Auth required code to the browser
instead of the 407 code.  This would then cause a standard challenge-response
cycle to occur.  I've started to hack the code to do this, but would appreciate
some guidance.

 Both netscape and IE know what to do with a 407 response code, since that
 is the proper response code for a proxy.
 
 You, however, are doing a "reverse proxy" or whatever so the clients don't
 know they are talking to a proxy.  There is currently no way to configure
 Apache to do normal auth instead of proxy auth in this situation.
