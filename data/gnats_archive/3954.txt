Linux 2.0.34 / 2.0.36
gcc 2.7.2
heavy patched www-sql
>Description:
Sorry, if I am too stupid, but
if I POST to a file with action-handler in a .htacces-protected Directory,
no user-auth is performed, 
the REMOTE_USER env-var isn't set and
the logfile shows no remote user!
(at home I tried with unpatched apache 1.2.6 and 1.3.4, same results)

Regards,
Malte

State-Changed-Why:
Well then you aren't doing it right.  Since you don't include
how you configured things, I can't be more specific.
Normally, this is caused by either not having the AllowOverrides
directive set to use the htaccess file or by using
"Limit GET" then being suprised when only GET is limited.
