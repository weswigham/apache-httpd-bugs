>Description:
 Dear sirs:  This morning I have received 68 unsolicited emails
 from those sending "faith statements" and breast size enhancements.
  I don't need either one.  As a minister, I do not appreciate
 the foolishness and presumption of those directing these emails
 to me and others.  The profound angry words of other's responses
 are intense yet understandable.  I have requested to be removed,
 and would like it stopped.
 
 Please stop the junk mail from arriving at my email address as
 well as all of the "forwards".  I would certainly appreciate
 it. - Denise
