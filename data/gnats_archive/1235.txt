>Description:
I am getting an internal server error

This is the difference I see
suppose I try to access https://server:port/~person
It should either show me a default html page or an index of listed files
But I notice this problem. It wouldn't work for the above, because it doesn't
have a '/' following ~person. This directs apache to go to

 table_set (r->headers_out, "Location",
                   construct_url(r->pool, ifile, r));

in handle_dir under mod_dir.c

This returns a code 301 for HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY
which invariably leads to an internal server error
>How-To-Repeat:
sample URL

URL working https://server:port/~person/
URL not working https://server:port/~person   -- (not the missing backslash here)
>Fix:
May be if there is a routine available to deal with Location
I see some directive called LocationMatch in Apache1.3
But I use Apache1.2

Please let me know whether there is anything available. I couldn't see any fix in the bug databas

And what does the error log say?  Anything?

Does the same thing happen when you don't use SSL?  If
not, then we really can't help you since that isn't part
of the base code...

You also don't mention exactly what version you are using.

 No you didn't.  Please read what I wrote.

 1.2.what?  1.2.0?  1.2.1?  1.2.2?  1.2.4?

 The Location directive has nothing to do with this.  As described in the
 docs, it does something completely different.

 I know what you wrote.

 <sigh>  It isn't like everyone in the world has this same problem.  It
 works fine for me.  Again, the Location directive has nothing to do with
 the Location header.

 What?  That doesn't exactly make sense.  Please post the _exact_ error.

 As I said before, does it happen if you don't use SSL?  If you use Apache
 without the external SSL patch that you are using, do you get the same
 problem?  If you don't, then it is something in the SSL patch you are
 using that is the problem.  We can't support every patch to Apache.  I am
 trying to help you figure out where the problem is, but you have to do as
 I ask.

 Hi 
 
 	Thanks for the reply
 
 	I use Apache 1.2.0
 	We use the free version of Apache here and we hooked
 	it up with the available SSL libraries. We didn't buy
 	apache. I am a new employee here and am trying to sort
 	out things. 
 	So please consider my questions from the novice point of
 	view.
 
 	I am trying to write my own modules to hook into apache.
 	The exact error is
 
 	access to /home/users/person/public_html/.htaccess failed for
 	server reason: Invalid command "Certdir"
 
 	I have written a module for supporting the syntax "Certdir"
 	It works with backslash.
 
 	The above thing works without backslash if I don't use SSL
 
 	One more question is in http_config.c
 	under parse_htaccess
 
 	If I need the apache not to cache my .htaccess files, then
 	how should I use the override option? where I should set it?
 
 	thanks

State-Changed-Why:
It sounds like your module or the SSL patches are to blame, and
since we don't support either of those... you'll have to try to fix
it on your own.

Apache doesn't cache htaccess files for more than one request.
