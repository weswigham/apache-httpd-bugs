Hello,

I am sort of stuck here, where I need to get the content-type of the script that returns some data to mod_cgi, I am directly editing mod_cgi.c for this purpose. Say:

#!/bin/sh

echo Content-type: cool/etc
echo

How can I grab that cool/etc in mod_cgi.c in a char* ?

And please could you tell me where is the script's output kept? (script_in or script_out) and how can I possibly convert those to char * from BUFF.

Thank you very much.

P.S. Apache is really great!

How about a programmer's manual in Apache documentation?

State-Changed-Why:
This really isn't the place for asking basic C programming
questions...

ap_scan_script_header_err_buff is the function that is called
from mod_cgi that actually reads the script output and it
does store the Content-type i r->content_type but that
really isn't too useful a thing to know.
