win98se 4.10.2222
>Description:
symlinks (aliases) are useless because they are sent "asis", that means not the file the alias is pointing to but the softlink itself is sent. This is true even with  Options FollowSymLinks  is active
>How-To-Repeat:
sorry, no win32-apache in the internet available; please try yourself
>Fix:
no experience with win-coding, sorry. But I think that can't be too difficult.

State-Changed-When: Fri Feb  9 15:19:35 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Win32 Shortcuts are not the same thing as symbolic links.
In fact, they are functionally very different.
Apache does not support following shortcuts to find
content.  Instead, you should look into using the
Alias directive.

Thanks for using Apache!
