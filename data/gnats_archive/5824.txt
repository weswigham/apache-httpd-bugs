I have configured Directory directive as following:
  <Directory /rootdoc>
	Options ExecCgi FollowSymlinks
	AllowOverride AuthConfig Indexes FileInfo Limit Options
	order allow,deny
	allow from all
  </Directory>
So, this configuration cause, that directory doesn't contain any file specyfied in DirectoryIndex directive (index.html, etc.) shouldn't listing context of directory.
Under Linux this option work properly.

 Uhh.... no.  You specified "Options ExecCGI FollowSymlinks".  I don't see
 Indexes in there.  
 
 Go read the docs on what Options vs. AllowOverride do.

 Erm... _something_ is different in your configs.
 
 I can assure you, that "Options ExecCGI FollowSymlinks" is supposed to
 disable generating directory indexes.  Read the docs; they are clear on
 how this works.
 
 What you should be doing is figuring out why it doesn't work tha tway on
 your Linux box.  Perhaps there is a .htaccess file somewhere or some other
 config difference.

 Marc,
 
 I have a handbook of Apache and I understand it, but I'am not sure that you
 understand me. In this configuration I want to disable generating directory
 indexes, but I can do it. Why ? Option doesn't working ?!
 
 Mirek.

Your problem statement is a bit unclear.

Do you get a directory listing when you ask for /rootdoc
on your Windows system?  Do you want to get one or not?
Do you get a directory listing on your Linux box?
Do you want to, or not?
