Hello,

What version of Apache do you recommend installing on a DEC Alpha running
OSF 3.2c ?

Are there any Binary versions for OSF 3.2c available to download?

Are there any special considerations or adjustments that we have to pay
attention to install and run apache on OSF 3.2c ?

Best regards,

Nasser Hajo
