>How-To-Repeat:
It occurs randomly with requests made by client web browsers on computers that have been afected by the "Code Red" worm. This problem makes the log files bigger with loose of performance on the server.    
>Fix:
noup. But there must be a way to avoid this problem (at mod_browser , mod_negotiation, or in a transaction module ... etc..)

State-Changed-Why:
I don't understand what bug in Apache you are trying to report here.  yes, code red makes HTTP requests.  Yes, Apache answers them.  Yes, Apache logs the request.  Apache is a webserver, that is what it does.  These requests don't have any significant negative impact on Apache, they are just a couple of extra requests.

If you don't want certain requests logged, then you should see the mod_log_config docs for how to do that.

 I don't know what bug he is trying to report either. But since
 we are talking about Code Red, I received this packet:

 Note the return code (200). I don't have a "/default.ida", so
 why not a 404??
 
 Cheers,
