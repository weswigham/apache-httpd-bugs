>Description:
Using a simple C++ module with one handler which creates an ofstream and then
inserts the string "hello world" causes a segmentation fault.  Each use of 
streams in any C++ module that I create does the same thing.  I am calling
_main() at the beginning of the handler so static initialization should be
done correctly.
