>Description:
after looking through the bugs database i didn't find direct reference to something a friend of mine and i just discovered.  my main httpd.conf file has 'hostnamelookups off', but a virtualhoster i have put 'deny whatever.com' into his .htaccess file, and boom, apache resolves every host it logs for him automatically.  we are assuming this is because the server figures that if we're denying based on hostnames instead of IPs it will automatically start to resolve everyone that hits the site.  i haven't seen documentation or discussion on this, but i noticed other people have submitted bug reports re:  way to get virtualhost people to be able to turn their own lookups on.. this seems like it works, documented or not. ;-)
>How-To-Repeat:
see above.
>Fix:
don't know that there is anything to be fixed, but a documentation note would be nice, right in the same spot where you talk about HostnameLookups configuration directive options.  unless it's already there and i'm being dumb.
