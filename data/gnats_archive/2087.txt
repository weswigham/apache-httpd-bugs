>Environment:
HPUX 11.0, using both HP ANSI C compiler and gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I'm working on getting mod_auth_dce 
(see http://www.intranet.csupomona.edu/~henson/www/projects/mod_auth_dce/)
to compile and work under 1.3.  In beta5 get_path_info() in main/http_request.c
was declared as an "int" and a modified version of mod_auth_dce.c would load
properly, since mod_auth_dce.c calls get_path_info.  In beta6, get_path_info's
declaration was changed to "static int" and now the loader cannot find 
the call to it made by mod_auth_dce.c.  So, I get an unsatisfied external.
Why was get_path_info() hidden with a static declaration in beta6?  Is there
an API method of getting this info instead?
>How-To-Repeat:
I would have to send you my modified version of the mod_auth_dce.c module.
>Fix:
Change the declaration for get_path_info() back to "int" if no API-based means
of doing get_path_info()

State-Changed-Why:
get_path_info is only designed for the core of the server - 
it should already have been done by the time the modules
should care about that information.  The DCE additions try
to go beyond what a module should do; there'll be some work
to reintegrate it into 1.3 when we release it, but Doug has
some ideas about that.
