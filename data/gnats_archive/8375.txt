>Description:
I am trying to install apache using apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src-r2.msi. I get the following message:

Another version of this product is already installed. Installation of this version cannot continue. To configure or remove the existing version of this product, use Add/Remove Programs from the Control Panel.

Apache is not in the in the list of programs in Add/Remove Programs.

I have searched the windows registry for references to apache and found none.

This appears to be very similar to proble 7345.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.
>Fix:
I need to be able to ignore the error about the previous version and then continue.
