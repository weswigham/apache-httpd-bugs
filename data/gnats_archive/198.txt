>Description:
When accessing the server through a direct telnet session, i.e. "telnet <host> 80",
the server does not properly respond to the "Range" header in a GET request.

I am using:

   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.mantissa.com
   Range: bytes=0-100

This same request modified for the correct server works with Jigsaw at the jigsaw.w3.org server.
Here is the Request and response:

ns1:~$ telnet jigsaw.w3.org 80
Trying 193.51.208.200...
Connected to w3c4.inria.fr.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1

---------------

Are there any configuration settings that I need to set for Byte Ranges or are
they set by default.  I searched but could not find any docs related to this on
the apache site.

thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
Is the document you are trying on parsed as a server
side include?  If so, byte ranges have no meaning because
the bytes can change for each request.

User reports the pages were server parsed, which was
the problem.
