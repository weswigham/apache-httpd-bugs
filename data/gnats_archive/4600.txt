>Environment:
All, my server is Linux 2.2.5-15, Red Hat 6.0, running SMP.
>Description:
mime-types contains the line 

chemical/x-pdb pdb xyz

This is incorrect- PDB and XYZ files have a totally different format, and 
plug-ins that read chemical data types such as Chime get confused by this,
resulting in all xyz files on the server refusing to load into the plugin
>How-To-Repeat:
Get an xyz file and a copy of the plug-in Chime. Plug-in is at http://www.mdli.com, xyz file can be gotten from http://learn.chem.vt.edu/tutorials/atomic/1s.xyz  

Save xyz file to server, try to read it with <embed src ="filename">
>Fix:
Change mime types to remove

chemical/x-pdb pdb xyz

and add instead

chemical/x-pdb pdb
chemical/x-xyz xyz
