>Description:
This is a feature suggestion, with a patch to implement it for Apache
1.2.5.

"HostnameLookups Off" is the best way to run a web server, but means
that to get meaningful information from web stats programs, a resolver
needs to be run against the logs.  Leaving lookups off is good for
speed, but it's because the lookups would ordinarily be in the
request-processing chain of events.  Once the request is complete and
logging starts, that server is blocked from further requests until
logging is complete.

We implemented a new option for HostnameLookups, LogOnly, which
restricts the name lookup activity to the logging phase (where it
won't hurt request response time, at least as long as enough servers
are already running to process incoming requests).

I'm going to *try* pasting the patch into the "fix" field.  If it
gets munged, contact me for a clean version.

State-Changed-Why:
Interesting idea.  I think the consensus of the group has
been that now that we have (in 1.3) a reliable piped logs
mechanism, we are avoiding new logging features in-process.
If you are willing to maintain this as a patch, I would
recommend posting it on a web site and registering it with
<http://modules.apache.org/>.  Thanks!
