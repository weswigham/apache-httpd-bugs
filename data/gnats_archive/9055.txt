 +>+>+>  INVESTORS CONTINUE TO SHIFT INTO MILITARY & DEFENSE
 By James Winston, December 12, 2001
 
 Since the events of September 11th, the markets have been
 generally rather tentative particularly given the slowing
 economy. There is one sector however which is booming and will
 continue to do so throughout 2002 and beyond...
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  MILITARY DEFENSE STOCKS!
 
 "This Sector of the Market is RED HOT and Getting HOTTER"
 -- Secrets of the Ultra Rich
 
 A recent review of publicly traded defense stocks showed this
 sector is up an impressive 69% for the 12 month period ending on
 September 10th, and post September 11th, it's up a further 34
 percent. Industry experts say this trend has just begun.
  
 It is obvious that the market demand in defense stocks has been
 very high this year, and has been further intensified by the war
 on terrorism.
 
 That's great for those big blue chip companies like Lockheed
 Martin (LMT,NY) and Northrop Grumman (NOC,NY), but the editors at
 the Online Investors Forum look for the undiscovered gems that
 could see triple digit gains.
 
 As an investor, the dilemma is, there just aren't that many
 stocks to choose from in this sector, which has added further
 pressure on the demand and price of available publicly traded
 companies.
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  AN UNDISCOVERED GEM
 
 We have found a gem. It is named API Electronics (APIEF:BB). API
 has established strong revenue growth and is positioned for
 substantial growth going forward.
 
 API is relatively unknown, but we expect that will change in
 January as word of the company's exponential increase in military
 contracts begins to spill over on to The Street. December is
 traditionally a quiet time for small cap stocks so now is the
 time to start your due diligence.
 
 When the broad investment community begins to hear about API, in
 January, API's share price will begin to see a steady upward
 price appreciation.
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  DUE DILIGENCE BACKGROUND
 
 "Commercial and Industrial Obsolescence is Emerging as
 Potentially one of the Hottest Growth Areas..."
 -- TechWeek
 
 API has been in business for 20 years, supplying very high
 quality semiconductors and microelectronic circuits to the
 military, aerospace, and commercial markets.
 
 The company's biggest customer is the U.S. military, which has a
 huge array of hardware that require sophisticated electronic
 components. High-value military assets, such as fighter jets,
 heavy bombers, and battle tanks can have a long life if
 replacement parts are available. But, manufacturers eventually
 move on to newer designs and components. This is what is creating
 a profitable niche market for API.
 
 Obsolescence is "One of the Biggest Threats to Industry"
 -- National Obsolescence Centre, U.K.
 
 * It isn't just the military however that need these high tech
 parts. As we all know, the airline industry is going through some
 very tough times and aircraft will be required to stay in service
 longer. Airlines will not squabble about spending a few hundred
 dollars on a circuit board if it keeps their $100 million plane
 in the air and making money.
 
 * Hospitals are also under the gun financially. The challenge
 hospital administrators are facing is keeping their aging high
 tech equipment operating longer then they expected due to budget
 constraints.
 
 * Other industries that are faced with electronic component
 obsolescence problems are the nuclear and petrochemical
 industries. Critical problems arise when essential components
 become unavailable margins by fulfilling vital electronic
 component orders to their clients.
 
 It is the company's military contracts however that we feel will
 make this company a big winner in 2002. With strong military
 pressure still being applied to Afghanistan, President Bush said
 yesterday that the Afghanistan campaign will not be over anytime
 soon and then hinted that Iraq could be next. As Bush and his
 advisors have repeatedly stated, the war on terrorism could go on
 for years.
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  CONCLUSION
 
 API has a growing list of blue chip customers including
 Honeywell/Allied Signal, Lockheed Martin, Litton Systems, and
 numerous other top technology-based firms around the world.
 
 The company has been consistently profitable since 1995. Gross
 sales rose by over 70% from 1999 to 2000 and their position
 continues to strengthen for 2001. Recently the company landed
 their largest single military contract in the firm's 20 year
 history. With the increased U.S. military activity in the Middle
 East, we project API will have a record breaking year in 2002.
 
 December is usually a quiet month for small cap stocks so now is
 the best time to start your due diligence on API Electronics
 (APIEF, OTC). We strongly believe API could produce a double as
 we move into the January effect next year for investors who buy
 at current levels.
