>Description:
I have been living with the following for a while assuming that it would be fixed in this release (1.2)
but still receiving the following in my error logs.

[Fri Jul  4 17:57:58 1997] created shared memory segment #512
[Fri Jul  4 17:57:58 1997] Server configured -- resuming normal operations
[Fri Jul  4 17:59:04 1997] accept: (client socket): Connection reset by peer

[Fri Jul  4 18:00:26 1997] accept: (client socket): Connection reset by peer

My site is averaging between 50 and 75+ connections simultaneously.
This really should not be a problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Only thing I can suggest is run linux, and try multiple simultaneous connections.
>Fix:
not currently, I was waiting on new release. Let me know if you guys find anything.
BTW, I compiled it straight from the configure script. I did not modify any paramaters

Erm... is there some reason you think this is a problem?
It is an informational message saying that a client disconnected
before the connection was established.  Do you have any
reason to think it is a problem?

 It means the connection was closed by the client before it was finished
 being established.  This is nothing odd; clients often abort transfers
 before they have finished or even started.
