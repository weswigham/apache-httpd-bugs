State-Changed-Why:
Running apache as a Service under 95/98 is implemented in the forthcoming Apache version 1.3.13.  We recommend you run Apache as a service to avoid allocating a console window.
>Unformatted:
Hi,
    Actually, I think if you just compile Apache as a Windows
application, it will still run fine as a service and will
not bring up that annoying console.

The main change you need to make (other than the compile flags)
is to write a function called WinMain():

#ifdef WIN32
int WINAPI
WinMain(HINSTANCE hInst, HINSTANCE hPrevInst, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int bShow)
{
    return(main(__argc, __argv));
}
#endif //WIN32

Please let me know if this helps.
