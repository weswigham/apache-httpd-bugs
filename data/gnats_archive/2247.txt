BSDI 3.1
>Description:
so, FD_SET sets a bit in a statically sized array.  at least under BSDI, its
behavior is documented to be undefined if the bit being set is outside what's
allowed by FD_SETSIZE.  although of course one may increase FD_SETSIZE, this
doesn't really solve the problem.  the right thing is to check all calls to 
FD_SET, so that apache doesn't indiscriminately twiddle bits on the stack.
the symptoms of this problem can include failing to answer on some Listen
directives, and SEGVs.

it is really a separate subject, but, under OSes like BSDI that support
more or less arbitrary FD_SETSIZEes, it would win big if apache used something
like FD_REALLOC, rather than forcing you to compile in (and hence hardcode) the
FD_SETSIZE you want.
>How-To-Repeat:
try lots of listen statements under BSDI (~200 and some).
>Fix:
i would send a patch, but i don't know how to do error exits cleanly from
some of the places where FD_SET is called, such as the lingering close
handler.  conceptually the fix is simple:  just compare every call to FD_SET
with FD_SETSIZE on OSes that don't support arbitrary setsizes, and allocate a
sufficiently large set on those that do.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache 1.3 already has the FD_SETSIZE tests... and I'd rather
see apache use poll() rather than the lame select() interface,
and especially not a hacked FD_REALLOC interface which doesn't
exist everywhere... but we're unlikely to make that change
because the next version of apache is likely to hide all these
details in a portability library.  (Currently we're doing work
with NSPR -- netscape's portable runtime.)

I think you need to compile apache with the correct -DFD_SETSIZE
on *BSD systems in order to get it to behave correctly.  Like
I said, the entire select() interface is broken.  The only reason
I never rewrote it to use poll() was that I didn't feel like
figuring out which systems support it... almost everything new
does, but our configuration tool is a pain to do these things
with.
