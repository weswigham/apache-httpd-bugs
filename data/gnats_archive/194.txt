Linux 1.2.29 (RedHat 4.1)
>Description:
I set:
ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/missing-handler
in srm.conf
Works fine.

Then I add 
ErrorDocument 404 /rebuild.html
in a VirtualHost section in httpd.conf

Now when a 404 errors occur on either host (main or virtual)
/rebuild.html is used.
Since they have different DocumentRoots it won´t work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set the ErrorDocument directives in srm.conf and in a VirtualHost section
of httpd.conf. Request a non-existing document from the main host.
>Fix:
Sorry, I´m not that good at C
