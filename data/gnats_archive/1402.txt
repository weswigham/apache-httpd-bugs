>Description:
The handling of symlinks is hosed.  There is confusion in the server between 
URL paths and filesystem path names.  The server moronically handles relative 
path symlinks manually and applies the path manipulation to the URL and not the
real pathname of the file!!!  The relative URL path is then accessed in the 
filesystem (failing of course, because this doesn't account for Alias directives).

URL:   http://localhost/pub/foo
			^^^^ Alias directive
path    /u/ftp/pub/foo     this is a link to ../bar
fuckup  /u/web/hackvan.com/pub/bar


PS:  I concur with bug 922.  Symlinks owned by root should always be respected, regardless of SymLinksIfOwnerMatch.

>How-To-Repeat:
Alias /pub    /u/ftp/pub/
cd /u/ftp/pub
touch XX
ln -s XX YY

now try to access http://host/pub/YY

you get this error:
[Wed Nov 12 04:20:04 1997] access to /u/web/hackvan.com/pub/YY failed for localhost, reason: File does not exist
>Fix:
Symlinks should be expanded in the filesystem pathname and not the URL.

To continue on a related nit...
It disturbs me that apache does not provide chmod-like behavior wrt symlinks.
The expanded name should then be checked against Directory directives to determine if
access is permitted.

 [What, is this the week where everyone who submits bugs has to do so in a
 derogatory manner?  It's sure nice to feel appreciated.  Not.  I apologize
 in advance if your message was jovial and I didn't catch the joke.]
 
 I cannot reproduct this bug:
 
 cd apachen
 echo hi >ick.txt
 cd htdocs
 ln -s ../ick.txt
 cd ../conf
 echo "Alias /whatever /home/dgaudet/ap/apachen/htdocs"
 
 start server
 telnet to server and GET /whatever/ick.txt HTTP/1.0.  It succeeds.
 
 Apache doesn't ever read a symlink.  It uses lstat() to find them, but
 that's all it does with them.  So it's really hard for me to imagine
 this bug existing.  In no event does Apache handle symlinks manually.
 You're invited to read directory_walk() in http_request.c if you want
 to see it yourself.

 That's a nice opinion.  Are you aware that there are systems, which are
 POSIX compliant, on which the owner of a symlink is absolutely irrelevant?
 For example, on said systems, to create a symlink with a particular owner
 you must setuid(owner) first.  On said systems, if a user directory is
 restored from backup, or copied from one filesystem to another, then
 all symlinks in that user's directory will be owned by root.
 
 We have no desire to figure out which systems behave like that.
 So SymLinksIfOwnerMatch won't be changing to cater to the systems which
 do allow chown()ing of symlinks.
 
 > Symlinks should be expanded in the filesystem pathname and not the URL.
 
 As I said earlier, they're never expanded.  We'd have to use readlink()
 to do that, I challenge you to find a call to readlink() in Apache.

 If you want this to change then submit a feature request.  As documented
 Apache does not do this.  Symlinks are never expanded.  If you want a
 personal opinion, I'll give you mine:  relying on symlink protection in
 Apache is a bad idea.  The only real solution is a chroot() cage.

 I was really tired and really cranky.  My hand was hurting.  You're right.
 I hate bug reports like that too.  Especially they're misinterpretations of
 the problem.
 
 As some penance, I got your address from internic and just wrote you a
 personal check.  Expect it next week.  Sorry again...what else can I say?
 And thank you.

 I screwed up and misinterpreted my logs.  But you already knew that
 something like that must've happened.
 
 For what its worth, my Alias directive was in a VirtualHost directive and
 some of my testing was done by telnetting to localhost:80 and getting a raw
 path.  Thus missing the VirtualHost directive and the Alias.  It looked like
 the symlink was screwy.  I was really tired...and even more tired of trying
 to figure out why FollowSymLinks wasn't working.
 
 I have some related weirdness which I'll include in another reply.

 On these systems with the screwy symlink ownership, SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is
 broken already and therefore worthless, right?
 
 On systems where it works, it seems that root is trustworthy.
 
 Food for thought.  Your call.

 WEIRD ITEM #1:
 
 Indexing a directory that contains symlinks causes spurious logging of file
 access failures.  There is no attempt to access the files themselves,
 therefore the logging seems erroneous.

 WEIRD ITEM #2:
 
 Options parsing seems to not conform to my reading of the manual apache
 book.
 
 The directive "Options FollowSymLinks Indexes" at the top-level of
 access.conf, which is not overridden by another Options directive in a
 VirtualHost or Directory context, doesn't make symlinks work.
 
 An .htaccess file with "Options FollowSymLinks" does make them work.
 Options is supposed to be valid in the config context.

 SymLinksIfOwnerMatch works until you copy a users directory as described
 ... but a malicious user could have done "ln -s / hahaha" and it would
 become a hole after a restore or home directory movement.  So if we treat
 root specially we open this subtle attack.

 I'm working on another security model for Apache ... I'm trying to figure
 out another solution to this problem.  But I'm too busy lately to get
 anywhere on the work.  chroot() should be easier in the model;  including
 chroot() compartments for CGI users.  I'll announce it when I've got
 something to show.

 What's up here is a deficiency in the API as currently implemented, well
 ok that depends on how you interpret the symlink rules in the config
 language. 
 
 One interpretation is that the symlink rules say that all symlinks the
 server might use in the process of handling a request have to be allowed
 by the symlink settings.  Another interpretation is that they only apply
 to the first document accessed. 
 
 Related to this are the tests which check if a file is a "special" file,
 i.e. a fifo/socket/device.  To be useful these have to be applied on all
 potentially questionable file accesses.
 
 The indexing function runs a sub_req_lookup_file() on all the names it
 finds, and that sub_req_lookup_file() goes through all the symlink and
 special file checks.  The subrequest is required at a minimum to decide
 what the content type is so that the icon can be constructed.  But the
 subrequest generates warnings and errors just like it would if it were a
 full request.
 
 Subrequests are used like this frequently in the server.  But they're not
 the only reason subrequests are used.  In other cases, such as
 content-negotiation and mod_include, the subrequest is actually run to
 generate output.  In this case the subrequest errors are really useful
 (and the symlink/special checks are absolutely necessary).
 
 But in the case of the subrequests that never get run, the errors/warnings
 are almost always not useful.  Fixing this is not easy in our current
 model... I'm not even sure these symlink tests are absolutely necessary in
 the case of some subrequests, but it's not something I really like
 thinking about.  I'd rather find some other way to protect things. 
 
 An idea just occured to me: a really cheap way to protect a root
 filesystem from being served is to check st_dev in the stat structure and
 only allow serving from particular devices.  Hmmm. 
 
 At any rate ... does this explain this weirdness any?

 Bing!  A fine idea!  Great.  Excellent.  This would help a great deal!

 Yes and I still think it's an annoyance to keep as an active bug in the
 database.

 Doesn't matter.  It's consistent with my view of how the world ought to
 work and how people ought to behave...not necessarily by making everything a
 financial transaction, but by saying "thank you" in some tangible way.  
 
 Spread the meme.

 ok, thanks for explaining it.  Did I mention that I hate it when bug
 compatibility interferes with otherwise sensible design decisions?
 I really do.

State-Changed-Why:
I think we resolved this after long discussion and such... documentation
insufficiency... or you were happy with mod_allowdev or something like
that.  We just wrote too much and my eyes are sore and I don't wanna
read it all again.
