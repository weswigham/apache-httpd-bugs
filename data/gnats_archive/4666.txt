>Description:
Using a slight variation on the config suggested in PR3697 Apache hangs on startup.  With the relevant section of config commented out everything seems to work fine.

#<Location /servlets>
#	AuthType Basic
#	AuthName MarkT test realm
#	AuthUserFile "c:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache Jserv\servlets\Auth.txt"
#	require valid-user
#	Options None
#	AllowOverride AuthConfig
#</Location>

No entries in error log.  Doesn't seem to be a timeout as it continues to hang if left alone.
