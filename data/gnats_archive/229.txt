>Description:
Setting Alias along with Redirect within Virtualhost directive
puts the server into a loop
of accessing the Alias'd directory (/netra/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/pimage/pi/).
 ie.

Alias /pi/ /netra/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/pimage/
Redirect / http://www.isportsnet.com/pimage/

NCSA works well putting the entry  http://www.pimage.com directly into
     http://www.pimage.com/pi
>How-To-Repeat:

State-Changed-Why:
I can't seem to reproduce this against the latest
development version (1.2b9-dev).  Also, the URL
you provide as an example doesn't seem to exist
any  more.  There were a lot of bug fixes in 1.2b8;
can you please upgrade to that version and let us
know if the problem persists?
