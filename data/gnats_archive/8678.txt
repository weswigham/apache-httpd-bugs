Linux kernel 2.4.13 on Slackware 7.1 gcc 2.95.?? (in this moment i'm not in front of the box)
>Description:
I compiled same way 1.3.20 and it runs all ok.
Making apachectl start it seems ok; making apachectl restart or stop it says
that httpd is not yet active.
No pid showed with ps -ef after apachectl start.
I tried some different options for configure but the behaviour is the same.
Thanks and sorry fot not too exhaustive problem description.

State-Changed-Why:

You need to check the apache error log.

In any case, this type of question should be directed to a user-support forum, not the bug database:
http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html

Thanks for using Apache!
