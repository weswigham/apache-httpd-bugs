Win95/8
>Description:
Well this isn't a problem, it's a suggestion.  Could you make Apache for Windows 95/8 run in the system tray, rather than the taskbar?  I really like Apache but I hate server utilities taking up that precious space at the bottom of the screen.  I can't imagine it's TOO much to put a little Apache icon in the lower-right hand system tray.  Anyway, just a wish!

Thanks,

Mike
