You mentioned something about all hosts have the same ip address.
Acording to some of my lookups they don't:

> www.alsutton.com
Name:    www.alsutton.com
Address:  193.243.233.97

> mozilla.alsutton.com
Name:    mozilla.alsutton.com
Address:  193.243.233.97

> www.inet.alsutton.com
Name:    www.inet.alsutton.com
Address:  193.243.233.97

> www.bpmarine.com
Name:    www.bpmarine.com
Address:  194.129.243.156

> www.bluer.com
Name:    www.bluer.com
Address:  193.243.233.97

The next one is very interesting, your configuration:
><VirtualHost www.shatz.com>
>DocumentRoot =
/usr/local/httpd/virtual.servers/shatz/www.shatz.co.uk/htdocs/
>ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ =
/usr/local/httpd/virtual.servers/shatz/www.shatz.co.uk/cgi-bin/
>ServerName www.shatz.co.uk
>ErrorLog virtual.servers/shatz/www.shatz.co.uk/logs/error_log
>ransferLog virtual.servers/shatz/www.shatz.co.uk/logs/access_log
>/VirtualHost>
Different in the VirtualHost and ServerName with different addresses
for these two names:

> www.shatz.com
Name:    www.shatz.com
Address:  195.200.7.72

> www.shatz.co.uk
Name:    www.shatz.co.uk
Address:  193.243.233.97


I did no more lookup's but is this above one, including the bpmarine
address, ok the way it is?


       Cheers,
       Oliver
