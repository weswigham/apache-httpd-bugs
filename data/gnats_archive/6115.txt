Comment-Added:
Can you be more specific?  What does your error.log file
indicate?  Are you trying to run more than one Apache
service at once?  And what user are you trying to 'run as'
in the services control panel for the Apache service?

 I am running Windows 2000 Professional and have downloaded Apache 1.3 HTTP
 server, using the default configuration as installed I get Error 1067:
 Process terminated unexpectedly.

 Q1. is there any message in your apache\logs\error.log file that
     helps you identify the problem?
 
 Q2. does this only happen when you boot the machine, or when you try
     and start the server with the NET START Apache or select Apache
     and click start in the control panel?
 
 Q3. will apache start with simply the apache command from a Command
     Prompt window after you change to the apache folder's drive and
     directory?  ie. 
           c:
           cd "\program files\apache group\apache"
           apache
 
 Q4. are you trying to serve files from a network shared folder, or
     changing the 'log in as user...' name in the services control 
     panel applet for the Apache service?

State-Changed-Why:

ServerName directive required in this case, reporter had
not checked from the command line for errors prior to the
report.  

Apache 1.3.13 (soon to be released) offers additional logic
to work around this issue that prevents the server from
starting.

 That would answer your question... always try running from the command
 line, and then fix the errors reported.  Please provide a valid ServerName
 to the apache\conf\httpd.conf file, and fix any more resulting problems.
 
 You should be on your way.
