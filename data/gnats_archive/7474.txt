>Description:
None of these lines generate any SSIs on my new botched 1.3.19 

    A <!--#exec cgi="http://www.usd.com:81/cgi-bin/referer.pl" -->
    B <!--#exec cmd="cgi-bin/referrerReturn.pl 'Return to previous page'" -->

    D <!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" --> E

All work on my older 1.3.3 (FreeBSD 2.X.Y)
>How-To-Repeat:
So far I have this much .. in .configure script .. 

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/local/apache_1.3.19 \
                  --with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl \
                  --enable-module=so              \
                  --enable-module=info    --enable-shared=info  \
                  --enable-module=proxy   --enable-shared=proxy \
                  --enable-module=rewrite --enable-shared=rewrite \
                  --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE

Which gives me httpd -l report ..

Ive been to apache for dummies and most of the cookbook pages on configuring
Apache with mod_so .. AND n/w Options, AddHands, +Includes, I AM MISSING the
magic step to reassert 'Includes' .. need pointer to the other RTFM .. that
I have not found yet .. over two days looking all over the Apache items, the
PRs and my now One-Way DeJa Usenet.  Thx for any assist.

 I am sorry if you found the answer unhelpful.  Unfortunately, it is really
 impossible for us to answer configuration questions in the bug database.
 We only have the resources to deal with actual bugs in the server.
 
 As is stated on the bug form, you must ask questions on a user-support
 forum before you bring them to the bug database.  There are still several
 methods of accessing newsgroups over the web (see, for example
 http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Usenet/Web_Based/).
 Alternatively, there are a few mailing lists available such as one at
 http://groups.yahoo.com/group/apache-server
 
 I'm going to restrain myself from responding to the nasty tone of your
 message.
 
 Good luck.
 
 Joshua.
