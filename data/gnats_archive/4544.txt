>Description:
I am attepting to access the public_html directory in the user directory /home
My access.conf file currently has
<Directory />
AllowOverride None
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Options None
</Directory>

<Directory /home/*/public_html>
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

This should allow me to access my web site http://IP.Address/~user
But I am getting a 403 Forbidden web page with the error message 
"Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /~jeremy on this server. "

My UserDir is set to public_html.

I got my information on how to configure the access.conf from the Linux System 
Administration Handbook, Komarinski, Collett, page 207 and from the UserDir
documentation file that came with Apache.

I have not been able to find any help on newsgroups, could you tell me what my 
problem is.

State-Changed-Why:

This is almost certainly not due to a bug in the Apache
software, but some sort of configuration issue.  We do
NOT supply consulting through this system.  Checking
<http://deja.com/> for "userdir" results in over 60
matches; did you try looking there?  Please use this system
*only* to report bugs, and be patient when asking for help
on USENET.  The software is free; so's the support.  If you
require results or better turnaround, you're probably going
to have to pay someone for it.
