>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, using gcc (2.7.2.2)
>Description:
When using Apache as the FTP Proxy for a browser (like Netscape),
and then accessing an ftp: URL, Apache doesn't give the length
of the file being downloaded so the browser can't display the
progress of the transfer (or how much time is remaining to
download).
>How-To-Repeat:
Trivial.  With Netscape, just hit an ftp: URL and do a "Save as...".
It will give "unknown" as the total file length.
>Fix:
Yeah.  Send the Content-Length: as part of the response

State-Changed-Why:
Fixed for Apache 1.3b6 by using the response
of the already used FTP SIZE command. 
Thanks for the hint.
