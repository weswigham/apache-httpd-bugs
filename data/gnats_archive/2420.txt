errorlog output:
[Thu Jun 11 13:42:28 1998] [crit] configuration error:  couldn't check user.  No  user file?:

if the user key and the password are correct the sever acts properly.
if the user key exists in the database and the password is wrong the server acts properly.

mod_auth_dbm,mod_expires are the only DSO modules.

 Hi.
 I have done some research on your bug report to apache (the
 synopsis was "mod_auth_dbm returns server error if user is not in
 the database"), but I haven't been able to reproduce it except in
 one situation: setting "AuthDBMAuthoritative off", and not having
 another fall-through authentication method configured. Is this
 your case? If not, I would need some more info, for example the
 section of your configuration related to authentication, and any
 more log lines that might be generated due to this problem.
 Hope this helps.
 Regards.

 Alvaro,
 Yes, "AuthDBMAuthoritative off" was in the access.conf file, and no
 other "fall-through" was provided. I don't have this issue with 1.2.5,
 though I did download 1.2.6, complied it, and the problem did reoccur. I
 guess, my question is, if another fall-through was provided, what would
 it be? And the question looming over my head "is this really a bug?". Or
 should I go back and RTFM!!! Maybe I missed something.
 
 I want to thank you for your prompt response to my problem. You are one
 of the things that make the Internet a great place to live.
 
 Be Well!
 Cheers,
 
 Jay Brown

 The problem is that in a certain authentication space there
 should be al least one authoritative auth method configured in.
 You can check the Apache FAQ, at this URL:
 
 http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#authauthoritative
 
 So I'm afraid this time the answer is RTFM ;-)

 Thank you for using Apache, and good luck.
