Windows NT 4.0 SP5
>Description:
I tried to install apache as an service and start it with the following
commands:
apache -i -n APACHE
apache -n APACHE -k start
If I make that in an dos-box (cmd) then it does work. but I need to to
put these two commands in a batch file. Then the error message "failed to
start service" appears. It´s only possible to use these commands in the dos-box by typing with the own hands. i think that´s a bug.

State-Changed-Why:

Obvious answer: the current drive or path is incorrect where
you are trying to invoke Apache.

Subtle answer: perhaps a .cmd, rather than a .bat, is req'd
if you are attempting this under Windows NT.

Is there a reason you are reinstalling the Apache service
every time?  This is unnecessary in nearly every case.  If
the config is changed, the startup or restart will pick 
the new configuration, without resorting to reinstalling.
