>Environment:
SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-03 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20
gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
If you have a map file with an entry like:
rect ../../sales/index.shtml 237,5 369,22
being called from a URL like http://server.com/graphics/cell.map
the imap_url function gets stuck in a loop trying to remove the second "../"
The variable "directory" seems to run out of directory entries before
the variable "value" runs out of dots.

It seems to loop forever inside the 
while ( ! strncmp(value, "../", 3) || ! strcmp(value, "..") )
loop (line 457)
>How-To-Repeat:
See full description.
>Fix:
A test like:
if ((!strncmp(value, "../", 3)) && (strlen(directory) == 0))
{
    url[0] = '\0';
    log_reason("invalid directory name in map file", r->uri, r);
    return;
}
should work (I think%2
