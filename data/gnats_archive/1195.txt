Given

AuthName "Two words"
AuthType Basic

in a .htaccess file apache produces an ilegal WWW-Authenticate header:

$ telnet www.math.uio.no 80
Trying 129.240.223.53...
Connected to kryseis.uio.no.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /~janl/test HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
Date: Fri, 03 Oct 1997 17:00:57 GMT
Server: Apache/1.2.4
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=""Two words""
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

Note double quotes in the realm spec.  You need not use the quotes in
the realm spec in the .htaccess file, but people will be liable to
if the realm name contains HWS.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  It has been
fixed in the current development stream, and the correction
should appear in the next release after 1.3b3.  It is
unclear whether this will be retropatched to the 1.2
versions.  The fix involves making the AuthName directive
treat its argument like other directives; if the argument
contains whitespace, it needs to be quoted.  It no longer
accepts the text-to-EOL as the realm name.

Thanks for using Apache!
