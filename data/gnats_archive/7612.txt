>Description:
mod_tls does not compile under windows with microsoft compiler
After minor code changes mod_tls compiled, but asserts when reading data from client, caused by the return code WSAEWOULDBLOCK from Windows Socket Library during nono blocking network IO. Expected by mod_tls is EAGAIN.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile mod_tls under windows with microsoft compiler
>Fix:
I have patched mod_tls, but I don't know if I used the apr macro APR_STATUS_IS_EAGAIN(ret) and the macro AP_MODULE_DECLARE_DATA correctly. Patch follows:

 I think APR_STATUS_IS_EAGAIN(ret) returns true or false, because the new
 version from the CVS does not work under Windows and under Linux in contrast
 to my previous patched version.
