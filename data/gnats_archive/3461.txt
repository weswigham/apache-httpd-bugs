State-Changed-Why:
Closing misfiled PR.

Bug reports must ONLY be submitted via the form on the web.
It also gives you a long list of things to do first so we don't waste our time.

The first hint is to check the error log.
>Unformatted:
I don't know if this is the right place for this but here goes:

Apache compiles perfectly, once installed it just dosn't run.
This is the same on all 1.3.x apaches with or without SSL 
I have glib installed, I don't know why it doesn't use it, if it will work
better with glib then libc
I have come to the conclusion it is not apache, but something else on the
system that will not let it run,  I realy need to get this going ASAP, so
if anyone could help me out here, drop me a MSG.

server2:/usr/local/apache/sbin# ./apachectl start
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started
