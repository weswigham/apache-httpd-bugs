Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
1.3.6 Win32 Binary Version
>Description:
When the DocumentRoot of a site is different from the default .../apache/htdocs 
(for example "C:/www/domain") Apache doesn't start (the log says that it cannot
find the dir). If the DocumentRoot is a subdirectory of .../apache (for example
.../apache/domain, but not ...apache/www/domain) it starts, but every access to 
the html pages is forbidden, even if the permissions are set correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
Symply change the DocumentRoot and the <Directory ...> directives of the default 
httpd.conf with a new dir.

State-Changed-Why:
I cannot recreate this problem. I suspect you still have 
directory access permission problems. Are you running Apache
as a service or starting via command line? If starting as a 
service, do you have the service starting with an 
appropriate userid? Is the failing drive NTFS and is it 
a network mounted drive? The default service id is the "Local System" account which does not have network privleges.
