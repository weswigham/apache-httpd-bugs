State-Changed-Why:
Please check out PR #2250 to verify that you're building
suexec correctly.  conf.h is in src/include/conf.h, so
it appears that your compilation line might be missing
an "-I../include" clause.  You can see PR #2250 at

 The problem here is that the docs are broken, not the code.  The docs say
 to just use cc ..., while you really should just do "make suexec".

The docs have been updated to reflect the proper
