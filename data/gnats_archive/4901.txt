>Description:
in mod_jserv.c:1495 if (strcasecmp(r->prev->handler,"jserv-action")==0),
r->prev->handler is null if we are redirected here via an ErrorDocument
directive (ie. ErrorDocument 404 /servlets/help) and this causes a crash.

[Tue Aug 24 18:00:38 1999] [notice] child pid 13535 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)

I'm not sure the full fix, but adding code to check r->prev->handler!=NULL but
then still assigning r->path_info=r->prev->uri got me what I needed.
>How-To-Repeat:
ErrorDocument 404 /servlets/trivialservlet
http://yourserver/non-existing-file.html
>Fix:
As above, yes at least in part.  I do need the path_info from the previous
request, to write a reasonable error servlet, but I have not dug deep enough
to know everything that is going on here... this is a diff -c
