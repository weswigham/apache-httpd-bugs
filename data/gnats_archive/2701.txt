>Environment:
uname -a: SunOS sunforw0 5.6 Generic_105181-06 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
gcc -v: gcc version egcs-2.90.23 980102 (egcs-1.0.1 release)
Apache configured with "--enable-module=most --enable-shared=max"
>Description:
After compilation and installation I tried to test the new httpd with
'apachectl start' as described in the docs. But the launch failed with this 
error msg:

Syntax error on line 26 of /home/proj/www-1/Apache/etc/apache/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /home/proj/www-1/Apache/libexec/mod_env.so into server: ld.so.1: /home/proj/www-1/Apache/sbin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /home/proj/www-1/Apache/libexec/mod_env.so: symbol ap_palloc: referenced symbol not found
../../sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

This line 26 is just the default entry:
LoadModule env_module         libexec/mod_env.so

Compiling the daemon with mod_env statically linked in (and the above line 
commented out) just let it fail on the next module (mod_log_config.so), this 
time with "symbol ap_psprintf: referenced symbol not found".

So -- what did I miss?
As far as I figured it out, these functions live in libmain.a, and it is called
by the linker. So everything should be in its place...

>How-To-Repeat:
I have repeated it now for several times. Next thing would be to try it on a
different machine (but that's currently not available for me).

So, try:

configure --prefix=/bla --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max
make
make install
cd <to Apache-sbin-dir>
apachectl start

At least it does it for me. 
>Fix:
Currently -- no. I will try to create a version without DSO suppport.

 After compiling all modules static I successfully launched the daemon, 
 browsed through the docs -- AND FOUND IT!! 
 
 So, for the next updates:  Please add the remark from the file "dso.html"
 that "some systems require --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE" also in the 
 README.configure and/or INSTALL files!
 
 After doing this, Apache works with DSOs for me... :-)
 
 So, it seems that Solaris 2.6 requires this, but configure does not know 
 about it...
 
 bye...
