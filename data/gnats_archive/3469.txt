>Environment:
FreeBSD 2.2.6-R + Apache 1.3.0 (Installed from FreeBSD's ports) is my
environment, but this seems to happen on other versions of Apache too.
>Description:
When an invalid URLs that doesn't exist such as 
http://server/index.html/index.html is requested, the server transfers
document located at http://server/index.html instead of Not Found error.
The images in the document are broken, because any request of that kind
gives the file index.html in this case.

To the transfer log, those requests including the broken images are
recorded as complete transfers, and nothing is recorded to the error log.
>How-To-Repeat:
This seems to happen with Apache's site too, as well as mine.
Please try these below.

>Fix:
I haven't figured what's causing this yet.

State-Changed-Why:

This is not a bug.  The second "/index.html" string is
what's known as 'path info,' and it is made available to
the actual index.html file in the environment variable
PATH_INFO.  Files using SSIs can make use of this
information, as can CGI scripts.  This is correct and
expected behaviour.  Thanks for the report, though,
and for using Apache.
