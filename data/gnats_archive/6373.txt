Configured as a proxy server with a CacheGcInterval directive, the Apache HTTPD

>How-To-Repeat:
Here is part of my configuration (intranet web site)
listen 80
#----------------------------------------------------
<VirtualHost 200.105.211.201:80>
	CacheRoot  "D:\proxy"
	cachesize 10
	CacheDirLength 5
	CacheDirLevels 1
	CacheGcInterval 1
	proxyrequests on
	ServerAdmin webmaster@essai.fr

	<Directory proxy:80>
		AllowOverride None
	    	Order deny,allow
	    	Allow from all

</VirtualHost>


>Fix:
It's probably because of the '/' in the path that is not translated for Windows
file system in '\'
