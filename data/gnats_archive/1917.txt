State-Changed-Why:
Please read the documentation at

   http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/

this is almost certainly a user configuration problem.
If you are sure it isn't, you need to provide exact
details of what you are trying to do, if you are trying
to use IP or name based virtual hosts, what config directives
you are using ,etc.

 Ok, go back to the docs page and read about the NameVirtualHost
 directive.  You need it.

 here is my httpd.conf file. I am using one IP and one port. only the first
 listed virtual host works. I switched, and the new first virtual host was
 the only one to work. All requests to latter virtual hosts are sent to the
 first virtual host page.
