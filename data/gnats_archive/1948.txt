>Description:
Our apache http server is crashing once a week. Below is a piece of my error_log file:

[Fri Mar 13 12:20:02 1998] connect: 206.64.127.141 port 80: Connection refused

[Fri Mar 13 13:28:50 1998] [notice] httpd: caught SIGSEGV, attempting to dump core in /usr/
local/apache
[Fri Mar 13 14:03:34 1998] [error] server seems busy, spawning 4 children (you may need to
increase StartServers, or Min/MaxSpareServers)


I'm not sure if the above error are causing the crashes. Stopping and starting the daemons
cures the problem for a week. Any help would be extremely helpful.

Many thanx in advance

State-Changed-Why:
First, please do not use obsolete betas.  Please upgrade
to b5 and see if that helps.

When you say it crashes, does it actually stop serving
requests or does it just log what you see in the error log?
