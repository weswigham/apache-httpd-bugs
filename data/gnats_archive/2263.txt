>Description:
Trying to move fron Netscape to Apache.  Need to duplicate all functionality 
first.  Virtual hosting using the BASE tag doesn't seem to behave the same.
Clicking on a link in a page which has the BASE tag in it where the link is a
relative link, works nicely on Netscape but Apache seems to duplicate the 
right hand end of the BASE tagged default URL.  As a result the off page URL's
fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
Yup.  Create a page with the BASE tag in the header where the BASE HREF points
to a non-root directory.  Virtuas host to the directory containing that page.
Then click on a relative link in that page which leads off page.  The URL it 
trys to get will be relative to the real root not the virtual host root.  If 
the virtual host root is off the real root, it seems that the real root is 
used apparently duplicating the right hand end of the BASE HREF pointer.
>Fix:
First, figure out who's behaviour is broken.  I'm not sure at this point.
I don't think a suggested fix will work until we know who if anyone is doing
the wrong thing.  Thank you.

      I've been poking around with this some more and I think I see
 what's happening.  
 
     Apache seems to be doing something which make sense, to me anyway.
 It just replaces the virtual host reference with the real path to that
 virtual host's virtual root.  Hence all references to the virtual host
 are by definition looking in the right place.  Netscape on the other
 hand has the really strange requirement of the BASE tag in the HTML.
 AFAIK, the BASE tag is supposed to supply the browser with a default
 URL.  However, Apache, already knowing how to proper translate a
 virtual hosdt reference is taking that translation and tacking the
 BASE HREF to it causing the duplication of the right most portion of
 the HREF.  I thought this Netscape method of doing virtual hosts
 looked a little strange at the time.  I could, and still can't,
 understand why they would need a BASE tage when the virtual host
 translation should be doing the proper thing.
 
      Upshot, I think Netscape's behavious is broken.  Example:
 I have a virtual host www.resp-ed.org which points to a non-root
 (relative to DocumentRoot) directory of /server/ns-home/docs/ire in
 httpd.conf.  The BASE tage in the index.html there is 
 <BASE HREF=http://www.resp-ed.org/ire/>.  This is what Netscape
 requires for some off the wall reason (if you can call it reason).  Of
 course, all references to off index.html pages use the HREF'ed url
 which ends up duplicating the /ire/ fragment in Apache.  In fact in
 Apache it would seem I don't even need to BASE tag since Apache is
 doing the right thing with the path translation.  
 
      AARRGG!!  VENDORS!
 
      In the mean time I'm trying to make the transision from Netscape
 to Apache as transparent as possible and this ain't helping any.
 
      Any suggestions?

You might be able to work around the issue with Alias
directives or mod_rewrite.  E.g., for your example

 Alias /ire /server/ns-home/docs/ire

even though '/' maps to the same location.
