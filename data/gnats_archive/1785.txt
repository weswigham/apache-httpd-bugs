Linux 2.0.31 + GCC 2.7.2.3 + Apache 1.2.5
>Description:
Netscape (v 4.04 and lower; higher?) does not do the right thing when it
receives a 407 Proxy authentication required response from a pass-through
proxy.  Presumably this is because a pass-through proxy looks like a reg-
ular server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Turn on ProxyPass, and add a
<proxy: *>
</proxy>
section to your config files to force proxy authentication.  Then try to use
the proxy server with Netscape.
>Fix:
Sure.  Have yet another set of kludges.  Add r->proxypassreq to http.h.  Then
in modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c: proxy_trans(), change r->proxyreq to r->proxy-
req = r->proxypassreq = 1;

To the config files, add:

BrowserMatch Mozilla no-407-with-proxypass

To http_protocol.c add the following code; use similar code as needed
elsewhere:

void note_basic_auth_failure(request_rec *r)
{
    char *auth_header_string = "WWW-Authenticate";

    if (r->proxyreq
          && ! (r->proxypassreq
                /* workaround for Netscape, which won't take error
                 * 407 responses from pass-through proxies */
                && table_get(r->subprocess_env, "no-407-with-proxypass")))
        auth_header_string = "Proxy-Authenticate";

etc.  You get the idea

State-Changed-By: brian
State-Changed-When: Tue May 19 19:29:01 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Our proxy is so ill-maintained right now that to add
effort to work around browser bugs seems counterproductive.
Particularly since this effort would require putting
proxy-specific coding into the core of the server, regardless
of whether someone compiled in mod_proxy or not.

If Netscape doesn't implement it correctly I'm sure it'll
be fixed in mozilla :)  If you see an area where Apache
does not comply to (non-de-facto) standards, please let us
know.

If on the other hand you want to whip up a patch to this, 
please do, and let http://modules.apache.org/ know about it.

Thanks!
