BSD/OS wichita.fn.net 2.1 BSDI BSD/OS 2.1 Kernel #1: Wed Feb 12 08:45:31 CST 1997     root@wichita.fn.net:/usr/src/sys/compile/LOCAL  i386, 

All known patches from BSDI.

>Description:
This problem looks like problem reports 295 and 611.

httpd processes start with the 8 StartServers that we have in our httpd.conf file. But the httpd process never responds to any request.

No errors reported to any log files.

We run about 170 virtual hosts, and it works fine on ver 1.1.1.

I have not tried to adjust the number of virtual hosts as of yet but wanted to know if apache had found the problem in the problem reports 295 & 611.

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly a problem with file descriptors;
see the FAQ for workarounds.  In your case, recompiling 
Apache (and possibly your BSDI kernel) with FD_SETSIZE
increased should make you able to use more fds in select.
If you have trouble, contact BSDI for how to increase the
number of fds available to select().  You could, of course,
cut down on the number of log files.

The change in behavior is not a bug in Apache, but simply
a change.  The old behavior is desirable, but isn't trivial
to restore.
