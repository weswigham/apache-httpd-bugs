>Description:
1) The line from srm.conf:
RewriteRule     ^/cgi-bin/(.+)$ /usr/local/lib/cgi-bin/$1 [T=application/x-http-cgi,L]
2) dummy script /usr/local/lib/cgi-bin/env (prints out environment)
3) link /usr/local/lib/cgi-bin/env.html -> /usr/local/lib/cgi-bin/env

accessing to URL http://localhost/cgi-bin/env shows environment
accessing to URL http://localhost/cgi-bin/env.html shows script source

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, sure. mod_rewrite operates a lot earlier in
the processing than mod_mime, so mod_mime can change
the MIME-types you set. That's just a side-effect
of the fact that mod_rewrite is a URL translator.
That one can do some tricks by setting MIME-types
is a goody for some situations, but isn't intended
as a real MIME-type force functionality. So, I
think although it's perhaps nasty in your situation
that mod_mime overrides mod_rewrite's things, it's
correct this way. Any hacks to change this behaviour
would result in surprises by users under other
situations I think.
