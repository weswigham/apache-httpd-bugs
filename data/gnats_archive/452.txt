>Environment:
Linux 2.0.30 as NFS client.
>Description:
If the server is started as root and later runs as another user when the logging
doesn't work and possibly the scoreboard file doesn't work as it should. The problem
is because root creates the logfiles and when the server changes to a new user
that tries to write to the open files the linux kernel sends the new uid/gid to
the NFS server and that user may not write to the logfiles.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The author of the NFS client code for linux claimed that the NFS standard
supported this "bug" and if that is the case when the forked servers will
have to log to a pipe to a process that run as root which in turn writes to
logfiles.
A temporary fix is to use CustomLog |"cat >file" format but this doesn't work
very well when you've got 100 Virtual hosts with their own log files. A solution
that works better is to use another program instead of cat that
reads the from stdin and writes to different logfiles depending on the type
of message that comes in the logfile

State-Changed-Why:
This is an operating system issue which apache cannot easily
work around without compromising security.  There are other
reasons you shouldn't log to an NFS partition, including
performance and reliability.  NFS doesn't guarantee the same
atomicity of O_APPEND opened files that is guaranteed by
local filesystems.  It's strongly urged that you put your
ServerRoot on a local filesystem.

BTW if you really have to log via NFS and are using a piped
program to do it then you should consider using CustomLog and
opening exactly one logfile which includes the vhost name as
the first field, which your pipe'd program could then split
up the log on.  This saves you descriptors in the httpd letting
you run far more virtualhosts.

You can add -DHAVE_SHMGET to your Configuration to at least
eliminate the use of the scoreboard file.

Thanks for using Apache!
