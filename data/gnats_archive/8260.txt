[Wed Aug 29 09:40:03 2001] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
[Wed Aug 29 09:40:08 2001] [notice] Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) PHP/4.0.5-dev configured -- resuming normal operations

The site has been configured to accept maxclients limit to 256
 and MaxRequestsPerChild 10000
We have tried recompiling apache also !.
The HARD SERVER LIMIT has also been set to 1024.

Still the child process spawned are not getting killed.
This is pulling down the sites performance. The no of hits is higher for this site.

Can u pls help me out in this?

Thanks.
