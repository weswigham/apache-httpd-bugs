-----------------------
I am still able to start JServ manually and it works fine.
I have this problem with jdk 1.1.7b release on Windows95.
I do not have this problem with jdk 1.1.1 on Windows98.
>How-To-Repeat:
Default installation
>Fix:
For me it looks like security restrictions. I am unable to open server socket.
Probably I am wrong.
