SunOS krokodil 5.5.1 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10
gcc version 2.7.2

>Description:

We observed the problem of a dying httpd described in PR#832 and installed
the patch mentioned in the known bugs page.

From that time, everything got worse:
- apache still dies on SIGHUP
- apache cannot be restarted because of a "bind: socket in use"

This error is reproducible.

 Thomas, please reverse the old patch (use patch -R or unpack apache_1.2.1
 again and retrieve the original http_main.c) and try this patch below.
