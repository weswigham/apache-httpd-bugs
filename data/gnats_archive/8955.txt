>Environment:
I am noticing an inconsistency in the way that the hostname is treated.  The problem is visible on www.apache.org.  See the full description for details.
>Description:
Look at the following URL running on 1.3.17:
 
http://www.whirlycott.com/phil/

Now do this:

http://www.whirlycott.com./phil/

See the final period after ".com." that absolutely specifies the hostname from the root of the DNS?

Ok, now go here:

http://www.apache.org/foundation/

... and now go here:

http://www.apache.org./foundation/

The last URL results in a 404.  It is also inconsistent behaviour and is also inconsistent with the docs on, for example, http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_proxy.html.

I looked in RFC 2068 (http/1.1) and didn't *see* any specific reference to this issue.

I have not had time to look at the src :(
