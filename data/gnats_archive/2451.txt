>Description:
There is a bug with .htaccess file.
If I set few parameters, such as
DirectoryIndex xyz.cgi
etc.
but don't set the authorization AuthType etc.
The .htaccess is viewable by the browser,
that is, going to http://localhost/.htaccess display the .htaccess file.
And i don't think this file should be displayed publicily.

Please take notice to this problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
dunno
>Fix:
Set the server not to return the file which is same name as
the AccessFileName configuaration directive.

State-Changed-Why:
This is not a bug; it is documented that if you don't
want htaccess files to be readable than you should use
something like a Files section that denies access to them.

Globally decreeing that no htaccess file shall be readable
would break numerous configurations and be quite inflexible.

Comment-Added:
To expand on what Marc said, the following will protect
.htaccess and .htpasswd files within its scope:

<Files .ht*>
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>
