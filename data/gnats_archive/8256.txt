>Description:
Hi.
The explanation of the Apache name at
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#name
is helpful and well worded,
but must have been written some time ago.
Information on the Apache Nation is not in fact 'difficult to find' on the WWW;
a simple search for "Apache Nation" at any popular search engines turns up
tons of good sites.

The current wording implies that the Apache are a small or faded group,
which they are not.

Otherwise, good words.


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#name :
Change the wording to "Online information on the Apache Nation is easily found;
we recommend searching for 'Apache Nation' at blah blah blah..."

Thanks for the note.  I deleted that wording and removed
a couple stale links.  If you have particular links
to suggest, we will consider them.
