State-Changed-Why:
The client is the one that does that, not the server.
Apache has nothing to do with how the client figures it
out.  What you are probably trying to do is get the last
modified date from a page that doesn't have one, like
a page parsed for SSI.  As is documented, last-modified
dates aren't sent with SSI documents because they change
dynamically.

If you don't think this is what is happening, someone may
be able to comment futher but you need to give an actual
URL to a page that shows the problem.
