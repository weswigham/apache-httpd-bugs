>Description:
I was configuring the 1.3.11 release for gprof profiling support with a CFLAGS="-pg -DGPROF" pushed into ./configure .  So then httpd builds as a monolithic process by way of the extern "moncontrol()" function in http_main.c.  BUT moncontrol(int) is not defined anywhere else in the source (or system libs for that matter) thus I get a linker error as "moncontrol()" can't be found.  Is there some extra profiling support source that I'm missing?  Thanks!

State-Changed-Why:
moncontrol has to be supplied by your OS's profiling support.  If it doesn't support it, you can't use the GPROF apache compile option since it relys on being able to use moncontrol to enable and disable profiling.
