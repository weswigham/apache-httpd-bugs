>Description:
There is no documented way of undoing a SetHandler directive (for example,
within sub-<directory> sections).  By looking at the mod_mime source code,
I found that "SetHandler none" would accomplish this.  I would like a note
about this added to the SetHandler documentation, so I feel more comfortable
that the feature will not be removed.  (Alternately, some other documented
way of doing what I want.)

Possible wording:

The special handler "none" will turn off any handler that may be set.

Thanks for using Apache!
