>Description:
rewrite rules placed in .htaccess files  that worked fine under apache 1.3.6
now don't. they cause the child httpd process to die with the following error:
[Sat Jun 17 15:57:23 2000] [notice] child pid 2131 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)

(and of course the browser reports "document contains no data".

this only seems to happen when the rewrite rule finds a match. when the url "passes through", there's no
problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
the best i can do is give you an example of the rewrite directives. which, again, work fine
under 1.3.6:

RewriteEngine   On
RewriteCond   %{HTTP_COOKIE}        !1
RewriteCond     %{HTTP_REFERER}     !^http://www.detritus.net/.*$
RewriteCond     %{HTTP_REFERER}     !^http://flotsam.detritus.net/.*$
RewriteCond     %{HTTP_REFERER}     !^http://detritus.net/.*$
RewriteRule     (.*\.mp3)           /cgi-bin/badref?request=$1
