State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri May  9 08:46:17 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Either recompile your kernel to support shared memory
(not sure of the option, perhaps SYSV_IPC or something like
that) or edit Apache's conf.h and remove the HAVE_SHMGET
line from LINUX section.
