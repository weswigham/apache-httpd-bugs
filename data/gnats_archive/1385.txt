>Description:
In srm.conf, I uncommented the line:
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

However, this caused files like "foo.cgi.txt" to be executed
as CGI scripts, even though the extension was just ".txt" and
the file was not intended to be interpreted as as script.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a file foo.cgi.txt, without execute permissions.  The
server will attempt to execute this file, fail, and generate
an error.

If it has execute permissions, the file will be executed.
>Fix:
Correct AddHander's detection of file extension.

A work-around is to use the line:
    AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .cg

If you only want files ending in .cgi to be handled, you should use:

      AddHandler cgi-script .cgi$

PR716 is on the same thing.

 Thank you for prompt handling of the 'bug' report.
 
 It seems as though I encountered a 'documentation' bug rather than a
 'software' bug.  (In other words, "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" -- as
 indeed I suppose it is.) 
 
 The documentation for "AddHander" makes reference only to extensions, and
 not to Regex handling.   Moreover, it is very peculiar that it would work
 differently from the AddType directive which has nearly identical syntax
 and description.
 
 If "This is the way things are supposed to work," it would be very useful
 to have that reflected in the documentation.  Thanks again for letting me
 personally know what to do.
