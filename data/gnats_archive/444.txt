Used a Netscape Server before.
>Description:
If you try to switch from a Netscape server to apache and keep your user database (dbm) you have to modify the code.
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes. Just create a dbm-user under a Netscape server and try to login under Apache. Will not work.
>Fix:
mod_auth_dbm: in get_dbm_pw change
q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr); to q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr)+1;
to fetch the last byte with the users name.

Can we have a switch for this?%0

State-Changed-Why:
Have you verified that this is still an issue with the
1.2 beta version of the server?  The chances of a fix
being made to/for Apache 1.1 are very slim..

State-Changed-Why:
Customer reports:
"it is. i still use the db which was created under the netscape server.
i had to patch 1.2b8 to make user-logins possible.
with the original version apache will refuse the logins as invalid.
but the fix is the same.

in     dbm_auth_module
funct. get_dbm_pw()
change q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr);
to     q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr)+1;"

State-Changed-Why:
I merged it into 1.3 as a compile time option.  Others may object
to it though, it is a pretty site-specific change.  But hey,
why not make it a bit easier to upgrade from netscape?
