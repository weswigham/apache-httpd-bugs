 If you log %{cookie}i (i.e. the contents of the cookie header on the
 request) and the client has cookies off, the cookie header will always
 be empty and so nothing will be logged. If the client has cookies on,
 for the first request from a given client nothing will be logged
 (because the client didn't yet have a cookie to send) and for
 subsequent requests the cookie will be logged.
