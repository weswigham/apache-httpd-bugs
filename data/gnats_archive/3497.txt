State-Changed-When: Sat Dec  5 11:38:04 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
You have to be more explicit about exactly what you are doing
and exactly what you are seeing.

Please send a script that demonstrates the problem.

How are you determining that "the header is overwritten partially"?

This really sounds like either your script or your method
of determining the last-modified are broken and is unlikely
to be an Apache problem.

State-Changed-When: Sat Dec  5 12:08:41 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Your date format is incorrect.  You can't just make up a
format.  As the HTTP spec defines, the following formats:

          Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
          Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
          Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format

have been historically valid and are accepted, althoug the first is the only
one that should be generated.

 Here is a little script that shows the problem.
 
 -------------------- script start

 I didn't make it up as such...
 It is perfectly correct but for the year.....
 It is a Y2K problem........
 If I set the Year from 98 to 1998 it works perfectly.........
 Perl localtime returns only a 2 digit year if used in an array context......
 But it returns a 4 digit year if used in a scalar context.........
 
 Sorry to bother you......
 
 (Still trying to get something reproducable for the connection problem)
