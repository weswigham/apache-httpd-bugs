>Description:
After the powerdown the box started to boot automatically
"apachectl start" had to start apache but didn't do it saying "httpd (pid 226) already running".
>How-To-Repeat:
1. stop apache
2. create apache pid_file (usually file called httpd.pid placed in directory /$APACHE_HOME/log)
3. write "1" into apache pid_file
4. put the link to apachectl in /usr/local/etc/rc.d (don't forget to append ".sh" to it)
5. reboot the computer
>Fix:
"my quick and dirty fix" was (diff apachectl apachectl.org):
<diff>
53c53
< if [ "x$PID" != "x" ] && kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && $LYNX $STATUSURL >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then
---
> if [ "x$PID" != "x" ] && kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null ; then
</diff>
