>Description:
The Header-line is ignored in proxy_http.c

  Header set Kalle "Kalle"
  ProxyPass /proxy/ http://freja:8080/
  ProxyPassReverse /proxy/ http://freja:8080/
>How-To-Repeat:
GET /proxy/ HTTP/1.0
does not return 'Kalle: Kalle' in the header.
>Fix:
This is not a correct patch but it works for me.
