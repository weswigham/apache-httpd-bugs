>Description:
If you have a 
ProxyPass     / http://193.xxx.xxx.14/
line in your config and the  193.xxx.xxx.14 has no dns entry
the Proxy will not work, it tries open to a random ip-number.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
1) to give the 193.xxx.xxx.14 an in-addr.arpa dns entry
2) I think to fix proxy_util.c:proxy_host2addr
	if gethostbyname(host); failed it should try to
        the ip-number as hostname?
