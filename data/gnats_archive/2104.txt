State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Apr 21 10:10:03 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
It means that Windows is broken and we are logging a message
to indicate that.  The fix for that is to get Microsoft
to make Windows work right.  There is a workaround in place
to avoid the problems it can cause, however we still log
the message as a debugging tool.  It may or may not be
removed before 1.3.0 is released.
