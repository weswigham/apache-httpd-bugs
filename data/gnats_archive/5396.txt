ERROR MESSAGE -- [30/11/1999 16:33:05:282] (ERROR) ajp12: Servlet Error: GET is not supported by this URL

SYNOPSIS: After restarting the apache web server and jserv, the servlet below (ExtendedServlet) intermitently fails with above error message. Once it has failed once (see above error message) it continues to fail until another servlet is loaded. After that, ExtendedServlet executes normally.

CODE:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class TestServlet extends BaseServlet {

    public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
        super.init(config);
    }

    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws IOException, ServletException {

        response.setContentType("text/html");
        ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();        
        out.println("POST REQUEST");
        out.close();

    }

    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
            
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();        
        out.println("GET REQUEST");
        out.close();        
            
  }
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;


public abstract class BaseServlet extends HttpServlet {

    public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
        super.init(config);
    }

    //Abstract classes to be implemented
    public abstract void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
        HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException;
        
    public abstract void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response)throws IOException, ServletException;

}
>How-To-Repeat:
I have been able to repeat this problem by:
1. restarting the web server (& jserv)
2. making repeated requests to ExtendedServlet
>Fix:
Not at present.

 Jon,
 
 As root:
 
 1. apachectl stop
 2. apachectl startssl
 
 I can send configuration files for apache and jserv if that would 
 help.  Basically what we were trying to do was to have some functionality 
 in our base servlet (error handling, logging, and etc). All of our other 
 servlets extend the base servlet. The error kept showing up randomly (every 
 few days). I simplified the code to what I sent, and was still able to 
 duplicate the error if I restarted the server, and made numerous requests 
 (through a web browser) to ExtendedServlet. We have worked on this for 
 quite a few days, with no success, and any help/insight would be greatly 
 appreciated. Also, our system administrator did the actual installation. If 
 you need specific details, I can get him involved.
 
 Regards,
 Mike
