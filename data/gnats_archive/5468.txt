Sorry... this isnt really a bug.

Im pretty sure this is not a bug (its a security restriction), but
is there ANY way to read files on remote NT file systems.  Server runs as
a network account (but not administrator) and i cant "see" remotely mounted
files using their full paths (ie.  //remoteserver/c-drive/winnt/system32).
Same script of course works from command line... just looking for a workaround. 

I read that this was done for security reasons... wondering if there is
an option on how to do it.

looking for a workaround even at the expense of security.  This is a trusted
environment.
