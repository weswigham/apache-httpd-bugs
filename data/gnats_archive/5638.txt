>Description:
I'm configuring mod_rewrite to handle name based virtual hosting.  This
included the following lines:

RewriteMap   lc            int:tolower
RewriteCond  ${lc:%{HTTP_HOST}}        ^(www\.)?([^.]+)

Which usually worked fine.  However, when HTTP_HOST is not set, httpd hangs
and goes into an infinite loop.
>How-To-Repeat:
RewriteMap   lc            int:tolower
RewriteCond  ${lc:%{HTTP_HOST}}        ^(www\.)?([^.]+)
RewriteRule  . -
-----
% telnet localhost 80
GET /
>Fix:
I can get around this problem by setting an environment variable to HTTP_HOST
or a default value.  This ensures int:tolower wont be called with a null value.
My kludgy workaround looks like:

RewriteMap   lc            int:tolower
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}                (.+)
RewriteCond www.defaultsite.com         (.+)
RewriteRule .                  -        [E=HTTP_VHOST:${lc:%1}]

Then I use %{ENV:HTTP_VHOST} instead of %{HTTP_HOST} elsewhere.

I've looked at the code, and haven't seen any obvious reason why this is happening,
however, I'm taking 1.3.11 for a test drive and will look into it further.

 I missed an [OR] flag in my workaround stanza... It should actually look
 like:
 
 RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}                 (.+)                           [OR]
 RewriteCond www.default.com              (.+)
 RewriteRule .                  -         [E=HTTP_VHOST:${lc:%1}]

 I just installed a fresh 1.3.11 on a stock RedHat 6.1 system and it
 exibited the same behavior.
 
 Here is what I did...
 
 $ tar -xvzf apache_1.3.11.tar.gz
 $ cd cd apache_1.3.11
 $ ./configure --prefix=/web/httpd_test \
               --sbindir=/web/httpd_test/sbin \
               --sysconfdir=/web/httpd_test/conf \
               --localstatedir=/web/httpd_test \
               --runtimedir=/web/httpd_test/run \
               --logfiledir=/web/httpd_test/logs \
               --proxycachedir=/web/httpd_test/proxy \
               --enable-module=rewrite
  
 $ make
 $ make install
 $ mv /web/httpd_test/sbin/httpd /web/httpd_test/sbin/httpd_test
 $ perl -p -i -e 's|sbin/httpd|sbin/httpd_test|' /web/httpd_test/sbin/apachectl
 
 I then edited /web/httpd_test/conf/httpd.conf, changed the port number to
 8081 and added the following lines to the end:
 
 RewriteEngine On
 RewriteMap    lc                   int:tolower
 RewriteCond   ${lc:%{HTTP_HOST}}   (.*)
 RewriteRule   .                    -
 
 After starting apache, I telneted to port 8081 and provided a host
 name:
 
 $ telnet localhost 8081
 GET / HTTP/1.0       
 HOST:www.test.com
 
 I got the "It Worked" page back
 
 However if I don't provide a hostname, ie
 
 $ telnet localhost 8081
 GET / 
 
 The httpd process spins wildly out of control.
 
 $ top
   PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
 13698 nobody    11   0  1160 1160  1020 R       0 96.1  0.4   0:04 httpd_test
 
 This system is pretty much out-of-the box RedHat 6.1
 Linux 2.2.9
 egcs-2.91.66
 
 I had this same problem on a RH5.2 system and a Solaris machine.
  
 I've tried to provide some detail here, because I noticed a similiar
 bug posted to the database that couldn't be replicated.
