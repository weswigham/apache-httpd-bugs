FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE, built from ports.  GENERIC kernel ...
>Description:
I have two boxen.  Both running FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE built from ports.
One box has Apache 1.3.12 installed.  The other has Apache 1.3.17.

The former box properly processes my includes, but nothing at all happens
on the 1.3.17 box:
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/games/fortune splash" -->
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/games/fortune fortunes" -->
<!--#exec cmd="/home/abp/bin/imgcount" -->

Nothing in the error log, and the HTML comment itself is swallowed by the
server, and not sent to the client.

I have tried various Options for Includes, as well as ExecCGI, XBitHack,
hitting the file URL explicitly versus using / ... nothing works.

My echo= works, though:
<!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"-->

 Okay, I'm wrong.
 
 1) The first problem I had was because the path to fortune was invalid on the
 second box.  Once I installed the command, everything worked.  That there was
 no error in the error log is either a bug, or a result of me misunderstanding
 how my eror logs are working.
 
 2) The second problem was masked by the first, and was simply a problem of not
 having activated the handler.
 
 Please close this bug and accept my apologies for troubling y'all.
 
 Thanks,
