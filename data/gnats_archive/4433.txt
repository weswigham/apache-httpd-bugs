>Environment:
Windows 98, Visual C++ 5.0
>Description:
this version of ApacheCore.dll does not use crypt.h header instead of wincrypt.h,
so Windows can't process encrypted passwords
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I have updated file "ap/ap_md5c.c", and sent it to Hypermail archive of new-httpd.
If you can't find it there, please see URL: http://sysd.stech.net/ap_md5c.c, the file is there.

State-Changed-Why:

Windows does not contain an embedded crypt() function, and
Apache cannot supply one that uses the common DES-based
algorithm.  On Windows, versions of Apache earlier than
1.3.6 can only handle plaintext (i.e., unencrypted)
passwords; 1.3.6 and later can handle passwords encrypted
using the src/support/htpasswd.exe tool.  There are two
bugs in 1.3.6: plaintext passwords no longer work, and
even encrypted passwords must be shorter than 8 bytes.
Both of these are fixed in the next release after 1.3.6.
Thanks for your submission, though, and for using Apache!
