State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 12:16:27 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/

The current JServ version is 1.1.2
