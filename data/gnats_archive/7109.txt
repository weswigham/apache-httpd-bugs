This is a request for enhancement
>Description:
I'm using mod_auth_dbm and I'm happy having a single dbm
for users/groups. I have a couple of dozens groups and give
different access rights based on groups. The problem is how
to display links on menu-like pages, since it's an obvious
nuisance to provide navigation to URLs that the user won't
be able to access.
>How-To-Repeat:
Writing an .shtml page for a logged-in user that,
rather than saying
- section A (for group A only)
- section B (for group B only)
will say something like
<!--#if expr="$REMOTE_USER_GROUPLIST = /GroupA/" -->
- section A
<!--#endif -->
<!--#if expr="$REMOTE_USER_GROUPLIST = /GroupB/" -->
- section B
<!--#endif -->
>Fix:
A workaround is to explicitely set the group list
in the enviroment, via an ad-hoc external program.

Including this feature directly in mod_auth_dbm
would save an additional lookup in the dbm file.

I hope this feature can be added for version 2.0
Keep up the good work!
