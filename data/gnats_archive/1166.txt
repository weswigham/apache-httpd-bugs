>Description:
We want to map some remote web-servers CGI's URL into the URL address-space of
a local web-server.
It seems to me, that using the mod_proxy module and the ProxyRemote
configuration statement is the best way to achieve this.

Unfortunately, the mod_proxy module does not turn off buffering despite
the ``nph-'' prefix to the remote CGI URL.

See above.

Haven't looked at the internal apache architecture yet :-(

Maybe, there is another solution to our problem by using
another module of apache. But I don't know any other solution so far.

Any suggestions are welcome. Maybe this should go into the FAQ %3

State-Changed-Why:

First, the new Apache 1.3 uses a better (HTTP/1.1 compliant)
way to create unbuffered cgi output, without any 'nph-' hack.

But it is unlikely that mod_proxy will ever be modified to
send unbuffered output, because it is no good idea to do
this for regular files...

I suspended your change-request for a later review.

 Subject: Apache as a proxy to CGI (quick patch)
 
 We run apache 1.2.4 as a non-caching proxy for a couple of CGI scripts
 that execute on a different server which we want to hide.
 
 The apache proxy module uses a large buffer for all data returned by the
 remote CGI. This is very undesirable in our case, since our data-source
 is slow and data arrives in small increments.
 Whith the standard apache set-up (including the proxy-module) the
 browser client must wait a long time before anything is returned.
 
 My request for change to the apache development team (mod_proxy/1166)
 has been suspended.
 
 To overcome this annoying limitation, I developed the following
 quick patch to the source in src/modules/proxy.
 Somebody else might find this useful :-)

Hey this looks like a reasonable change considering the
similar change to CGIs in 1.3.
