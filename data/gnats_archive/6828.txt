>Description:
The following does not work:

   http://www.snert.com/~chrisma/server-info

Server-info, server-status, and other handlers that would have been defined as
URIs with <location /cool-handler> sections are not found when the URI prefix is
/~user.  

Everything after the /~user should be considered like a URI, be it a file or
a module handler.  mod_userdir should perform a subrequest on the remaining URI
to determine if its a file or handler.  If it is a handler, it should be the
module's responsibility to determine whether or not it processes the request
in relation to users.

This issue came up during the development of mod_throttle 3.0, where I want to
have a special handler to return the status of an induhvidual server or user.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install something like server-info or server-status. Request a URL something
like this:  http://www.snert.com/~chrisma/server-info
>Fix:
Not as yet.

 Here is a proposed patch for mod_userdir.c
 
 An example of this patch in operation can be found here:
 
         http://www.snert.com:8888/~chrisma/server-info
 
 While the above is not of great interest, the following is now possible:
 
         http://www.snert.com:8888/~chrisma/throttle-me
         http://www.snert.com:8888/throttle-me
 
 I can now specify a <Location /throttle-me> that invokes the throttle-me 
 handler in mod_throttle/3.0 and get different results depending whether
 a ~user is specified or not.

 Why do you expect a location starting </cool-handler> to match a URI
 starting <~user/>?
 
 Why can't you use this config?
 
 	<Location /~*/cool-handler>
 		SetHandler cool-handler
 	</Location>
