 It'd be great if you could provide a small config file that demonstrates
 the problem.  There were some changes to virtualhosts in 1.2.6, but they
 should only have affected various "undefined" behaviours, not any of the
 defined behaviour.
 
 Thanks
 Dean

 Hello.
 
 I've upgraded to 1.2.6 from 1.2.5 and one (only one) of my virtual
 hosts did not point to the correct one. They are non-IP virtual hosts
 (all on one IP address). The pages showed where the "default" for this
 address, meaning the last host entered in the configuration.=20
 
 The host that fails is ntinternals.ovb.ch, ntinternals.mhs.ch works
 fine, which points to exactly the same location, perhaps that matters.
 
 Here are the relevant lines, all virtual host for this ip address.
 
 # --- Address 195.65.24.145---
 <VirtualHost fwu.ovb.ch>
 ServerAdmin ovb@ovb.ch
 DocumentRoot /usr/www/fwu

 </VirtualHost>
 
 # --- Address 195.65.24.145 ---
 <VirtualHost ntinternals.ovb.ch>

 ServerName ntinternals.mhs.ch

 CustomLog logs/ntinternals.ovb.ch-referer_log "%t Host: %v From:

 </VirtualHost>
 
 # --- Address 195.65.24.145 ---
 <VirtualHost www.ovb.ch>

 ServerName www.ovb.ch

 TransferLog logs/www.ovb.ch-access_log
 CustomLog logs/www.ovb.ch-referer_log "%t Host: %v From: %{Referer}i
 =46or: %U By: %h"
 </VirtualHost>
 
 I also noticed, that the time needed to answer a request to
 ntinternals.ovb.ch, which returns www.ovb.ch, took much longer until
 it got answered as all the other hosts which work correctly.
 
 
 
        Cheers,

 On your webserver machine, try this:
 
 % telnet ntinternals.ovb.ch 80
 % telnet ntinternals.mhs.ch 80
 
 and make sure that it does get the same IP address for both -- maybe
 there's something wrong with the DNS on that server which is causing
 ntinternals.ovb.ch to have the wrong IP address. 
 
 (I'm still looking for other possibilities.)

 DNS is ok, points for all hosts to .145. BUT if found what the problem
 caused on my host. I have the lookup order in my host.conf as follows:
 
 hosts
 bind
 
 and in the hosts there was the "wrong" ip address entered. The address
 there was .144, which is the primary address for this machine (FreeBSD
 2.1.7 by the way). The DNS has .145, which all the other mentioned
 vhost have too.=20
 
 >(I'm still looking for other possibilities.)
 I still see it as a strange behavor in Apache 1.2.6 and definitly
 different that 1.2.5. The .144 is a valid address for this host and
 Apache does listen to that IP too. Another very strange this is, that
 if I make a request to the IP address itself, http://195.65.24.144, I
 don't end up at www.ovb.ch, but the default page for that IP address,
 which is not a virtual host but the "global" page as defined by
 ServerRoot outside any VirtualHost. So if Apache only checks
 VirtualHosts for .144, it shoud have returned the main documents for
 the server and not www.ovb.ch.
 
 I hope you can follow my thoughts.
 
 
        Cheers,
        Oliver

User had an /etc/hosts mismatch with the DNS... and it worked

 Yup this is the bug then, it's a configuration problem... you'll need to
 fix that dns.  (That's why I asked about it).

 It's definately different, it was deliberately changed for security
 reasons.  Suppose that one of the addresses had been 10.0.0.1 and only
 supposed to be accessed via your local network, and not from the wild
 internet (i.e. filtered at your router).  Apache prior to 1.2.6 (and prior
 to 1.3b1 I think it was) would happily let you access hosts that were
 bound to other IP addresses.  Here's the CHANGES entry:
 
   *) SECURITY: When a client connects to a particular port/addr, and
      gives a Host: header ensure that the virtual host requested can
      actually be reached via that port/addr.  [Ed Korthof <ed@organic.com>]

 I'd need more of the config to know if this is wrong.  Usually you want to
 put in a _default_ virtual host to control access to otherwise unspecified
 IP addresses.  It could just be one of the other brokennesses of pre 1.3
 vhosts... and unlikely to be fixed (since it's all rewritten in 1.3
 anyhow).

 The machine my problems occured on only has one IP address, and the DNS
 entries for all names are fine.
 
 As I stated before, 1.2.5 works fine, drop in the 1.2.6 binary and
 things break, drop back to the 1.2.5 binary and all is OK again.

 Without a sample config I can't debug any problem.  That's why I asked for
 it.

 Did you look at your hosts file? At my site the problem was a wrong
 address in the hosts file for the host that failed!

[Adding misdirected text from Al Shatz that got created as
a new PR]

Hi Oliver,

www.bpmarine.com has since been moved to a new box, the web server only
serves the pages for old DNS data hanging around. Since sending the
Email to Dean it's been cleaned out of the config files.

www.shatz.com is comming over to our servers, and so the data is set up
so that using bind on the local machine it resoves to 193.243.233.97 so
that when the DNS changes propagate the web server will be on-line and
waiting.

The problem occurs with www.guernseyci.com, which appears to become the
default server (i.e. if people type in http://193.243.233.97/), as well
as the server for www.sbc.org.uk.
