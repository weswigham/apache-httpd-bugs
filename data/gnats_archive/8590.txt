>Description:
I want the server give configurable "deny" response. Currently, all denied client will receive a 403 error message. Although ErrorDocument give an option to customize error message, but there're still some headers can not be removed (such as "Date", "server" etc.), but I need another option: no any response (included all headers) to the denied client, as if the daemon is not running at all, i.e. the server is hidden.
I searched many forums and this database, seems no way in current config setup, include "mod_headers", the "unset" cannot remove any headers before this module.
Here is my last chance! Help!
>How-To-Repeat:
Just compare the browser display with or without Apache running to see a denied response.
>Fix:
Add a new directive to configure what headers should the denied access response.

State-Changed-Why:
Umh... the client has to make a request to the server before the server knows what it is requesting.  So it has to send some response to the client.  What you are asking for simply is not technically possible, period.

Sure, you can control the headers by using an ErrorDocument that goes to your own module... but that still won't do what you want.

 Sorry, I forgot to point out that my client access permission criteria is
 set by IP address such as: "allow from x.x.x.x".
 I think the IP address info can be got before any response
 been sent, even "HTTP/1.1 200" etc.

Comment-Added:
Whether it could theoretically do this or not, it is not
the job of an http server to be dropping requests on the
floor.  If you want that, you should configure your OS
or firewall to do the job.
