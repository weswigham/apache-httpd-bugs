>Description:
The on-line documentation for suexec makes reference to 
"APACI's suEXEC configuration options".  The documentation does not explain
how to use these options, however.  

I tried (from the src directory) doing 

./Configure --layout

and

./Configure --enable-suexec

and always get 

"ERROR: Bad command line option"

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
So I've gone ahead and manipulated the suexec.h file directly.  Anyhow, you 
should add a bit of documentation (perhaps an example?) of how to use
these flags.  Maybe you could add something to both the suexec doc, and the
general Apache installation doc.

"src/Configure" is not APACI.  "configure" in the directory

 Marc,
 
 Thanks for the quick response.  That's got it fixed for me.  I still
 suggest improving the documentation to make
 this clearer.  The stallation documentation (
