>Release:        1.3.9
>Environment:
Digital UNIX 4.0D version 878.  gcc 2.95.1, gnu make 3.78.1, and default 
version of sed (unknown version: 'sed -V' generates an error.)
>Description:
When trying to compile a shared module, apxs generates bad commands.  Here
is a sample of the error:

> /usr/local/bin/make APXS=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs
/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs  -o mod_ip_forwarding.so  -c mod_ip_forwarding.c
gcc -DOSF1 -DUSE_HSREGEX -DUSE_EXPAT -I../lib/expat-lite -fpic -DSHARED_MODULE -I/usr/local/apache/include  -c mod_ip_forwarding.c
ld -shared -expect_unresolved * -s -o mod_ip_forwarding.so mod_ip_forwarding.o 
ld:
Object file format error in: Makefile: read_cur_obj_info: bad file magic number(0x440a)
apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=65536
make: *** [mod_ip_forwarding.so] Error 1

>How-To-Repeat:
I built and installed apache_1.3.9 and apache-contrib-1.0.7 from ftp.apache.org
on a DEC UNIX machine.  The problem occurs whenever I try to build any of the 
modules in apache-contrib.
>Fix:
It looks like apxs is trying to issue the command 
"ld -shared -expect_unresolved * -s -o mod_ip_forwarding.so mod_ip_forwarding.o".
The man page for ld warns that any wildcards following -expect_unresolved should
be shell-escaped.

I was able to fix this by fixing the definition of $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB in apxs.
It should be:
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = '-shared -expect_unresolved \* -s'; # substituted via Makefile.tmpl  
instead of:
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = '-shared -expect_unresolved * -s'; # substituted via Makefile.tmpl

With this change I was able to build and link everything without troubles.

State-Changed-Why:

This was fixed after the release of 1.3.9, and should
appear in the next release.    You can apply the patch at
<http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/apply_to_1.3.9/apxs-osf-dso.patch>
to fix it in the meantime.
Thanks for the report and for using Apache!
