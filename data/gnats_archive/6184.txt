My server is running fine. Server side is a Korn shell script(s) with some
C executables . As the functions performed by these are critical and cannot
be stopped in the middle, pls advise me as to how I should handle (capture)
the stop button of the broswer(Netscape and IE) when a user presses it.

My scripts stop the processes in the middle and the system behaves odd after
a "Stop".

Thanks and Regards
Balaji
>Description:
When the browsers "stop" button is pressed by the user of a system that
runs on the apache server version 1.3, the server side scripts which
are korn shell scripts when stopped in the middle loose their connections to
the client (browser and the server daemons). This aborting of execution
leaves incomplete cycles of function executions and the system fails
from then on.

How shall we capture the "stop" button of the browser in a Korn shell server
script or how shall we inactivate the stop button of browser who browses.
As this is a socket connection , I feel trapping signals wont work.

Kindly suggest some ways
