>Description:
If I'm a lowly user and my server admins have configured httpd with

IndexIgnore README ...

then there's no way I can get a file named README into a FancyIndexing index.
It would be nice if I could do something like this in my .htaccess file:

IndexUnignoreAll
IndexIgnore . .htaccess

Or if you wanted to be more ambitious:

IndexUnignore README
