Linux 2.0.35
>Description:
When i get a file in netscape 2 3 or 4 from my old windows 3.1 server of type
home   (IE no extension) i get the webpage.
if i pull it from the linux box it sees it as mime  text.
Where can i read about mimes and how netscape KNOWS what a file is?
I assume i need to call home home.htm or home.html?

Also on the java prob you say to put
    matchbrowser jdk1.0  or some such on a line in a config file.
 ok thats nice but WHICH config file?
Which files ie access/httpd/magic/mime.types/srm do what?

>Fix:
