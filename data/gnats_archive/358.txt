>Description:
  An ErrorDocument directive in a .htaccess file no longer displays the
specified document. The system-wide ErrorDocument (in srm.conf) is used 
instead. This worked in 1.2b7.
  Other directives (rewrites) in the .htaccess file are being executed.
  In b7, the ErrorDocument in srm.conf didn't work, but the one in the .htaccess
did. Now the situation seems to be reversed. Both cases work in 1.2b6.
>How-To-Repeat:
  http://www.ao.com/gribble  displays our system default 
(contains the Alpha Omega logo).
  http://www.ao.com/~kohler/gribble should display a page with a picture
of a well-known cartoon character, but instead displays the same page as above.
  We are still running b6 on a backup server (http://www2.ao.com). These same
URL's with www2 substituted for www work as expected.

 Does the one in the .htaccess file work if you remove the system-wide one? 
 Are any errors being reported in the error log? 
 
 What are the exact directives you are using?
 
 A quick test shows it working fine in my setup, so there must be something
 else necessary for it to happen.

   I mailed a followup to my original report, but it probably hasn't reached
 you yet.
 
   Anyway, the short form is... Nevermind!
 
   I had forgotten that in an attempt to get ErrorDocument working in b7, I
 had enclosed the system-wide instance in a <Location> block. When I removed
 that from the srm.conf file everything worked properly again.
 
   Sorry for the hassle. I feel really stupid!
