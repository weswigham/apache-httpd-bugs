>Description:
Following the instructions found at www.apacheweek.com/tips under the section
"How to speed up Apache," it is recommended that the following be used to 
prevent Apache from searching the entire directory tree above the DocumentRoot
for .htaccess files:

                   <Directory />
                   AllowOverride None
                   </Directory>

                   <Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs>
                   AllowOverride All
                   </Directory>

This part works fine.  However, I also added:

                   <Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin>
                   AllowOverride All
                   </Directory>

Unfortunately, this does NOT seem to work.  .htaccess files in the cgi-bin 
directories are being ignored!  The only way to get them to work again is 
to comment out the original Directory directive:

                   #<Directory />
                   #AllowOverride None
                   #</Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try what I said above...
>Fix:
Sounds like a software problem to me..

 Sorry but I can't reproduce this.  I did this:
 
 % echo garbage >cgi-bin/.htaccess
 
 and I set up the <Directory>s the way you listed.  And when I access
 /cgi-bin/printenv it fails and my error log shows:
 
 [Fri Feb  6 11:42:06 1998] access to
 /home/dgaudet/ap/apachen/cgi-bin/.htaccess failed for 127.0.0.1, reason:
 Invalid command garbage
 
 So it is definately reading the .htaccess file.

Are you sure that your ScriptAlias and Directory directives
are referring to the same directory?  I.e., do you have a

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/

to match your "<Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin>"?

 Hi guys,
 
 I think I found the problem.  I'm not sure if it's considered a bug or an
 error on my part, but what I had done was this: 
 
   <Directory />
   AllowOverride None
   </Directory>
 
   <Directory /opt/local/etc/httpd/htdocs>
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
   AllowOverride All
   </Directory>
 
   <Directory /opt/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin>
   AllowOverride All
   </Directory>
 
   ...
 
   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/
                          ^^^
 
 Notice that /cgi-bin/'s ScriptAlias points to /USR/local... instead of
 /OPT/local...  This worked because /usr/local is a link to /opt/local.
 However, probably because of the way Apache determines the directory tree, 
 the <Directory /opt/local/.../cgi-bin> did not get evaluated for
 /usr/local/.../cgi-bin.  
 
 To make a convoluted story short, changing the ScriptAlias to
 
   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /opt/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/
                          ^^^
 fixed the problem. :)
