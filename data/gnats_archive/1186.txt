Uhm... I don't understand your problem.
You cannot access pages without an extension?
If you want a page without an extension to be transmitted
with a "text/html" content-type you have to use the
DefaultType directive...

         Regarding the problem I queried by e-mail, I think there is a
 confusion.
 Probably I did not explain the problem very well. What I would like to
 know is if there is an option for the server software which allow the
 users to specify a html file inside an URL without extension, that is,
 in the case I specified a html file name without extension, I would need
 the server will be able to concatenate the extension .html or .htm
 automatically.
 I hope the problem will be better explained this time.
 
         I try to explain better my problem with an example:
 
         I have a html source file called sinclair.htm and I'd like to wath
 this page with this URL --> http://www.ugr.es/sinclair instead of this -->
 http://www.ugr.es/sinclair.htm
         If I specify the fist URL, the server does't find the file. I'd like
 to find the way for adding at this type of pages the extensions automatically.
 
 Thanks in advance and regards

Ah, I see.
As James Sutherland already pointed out you can use
mod_speling (see http://www.zyzzyva.com/module_registry/)
for this task or you can activate MultiViews to
achive the desired behaviour (although the MultiViews
search is normally used for content negotiation,
see the manual for details).

But please use comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
for questions like this in the future and only
use the bug report system if you are sure that
you've found a bug in Apache.
