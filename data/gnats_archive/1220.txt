Linux rat.org 2.0.27 #1 Sat Dec 21 23:44:11 EST 1996 i586
compiler: just regular gcc
>Description:
output from CGI apps won't even begin to send until the program is terminated.
This renders server-push programs totally useless.
Try making a multipart/mixed document. it won't even send any of it
to the client until the program finishes.
Is there a way to work around this behavior?
>How-To-Repeat:
there's an example of server push at
http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html
or http://rat.org/cgi-bin/xx is the test script i've been using. notice
it hangs for awhile, then spits out the output all at once.
>Fix:
have a way to make cgi programs print their output in realtime.
or if there is a way, i'd love to know how, and i'd be extremely grateful. :)

In v1.3, this will not be necessary as the buffering will
be removed.
