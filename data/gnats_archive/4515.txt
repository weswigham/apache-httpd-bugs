* Presidential Primary, On-Line, Nationwide, July 4, 1999 
On the anniversary of our Declaration of Independence from an English habitual politician, King George III, please help end the current reign of habitual politicians. Help legitimize on-line democracy with your nominee for President. 

Reform American Politics at the national, state and local level by proving out a zero-cost primary and election process. There is no charge. In fact, you will receive lifehour tax credits for your contribution. If we can use computer to work and shop from home, how soon before we start using them to govern from home? It's up to you.
