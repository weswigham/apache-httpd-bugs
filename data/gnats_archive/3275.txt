  Solaris 2.6 for x86
  GNUg77 0.5.2.1  which is equivalent to GNUgcc 2.7.2.3
  Perl 5.004.04
Tried Configuration file with WANTHSREGEX set to default and yes (neither worked).

do I have incorrect compilers or am I missing classes??

State-Changed-Why:
You need a compilation environment installed.  That has
to include the "ar" program.  If you look on your 2.5 system,
you will find that your path is different or you have it installed
somewhere different.  By default, it is in /usr/ccs/bin
which isn't in your path by default.
