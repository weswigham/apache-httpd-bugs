i386-ibm-aix - IBM AIX Version 1.3.0 ptf (patchlevel) 0024
gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
The IBM AIX version 1.X operating system does not allow a file name or directory
name to be "@" (a single ampersand).  When I enable and use the mod_proxy
module, it is consistently logging the following type of errors:

[Thu Oct 23 20:30:35 1997] proxy: error creating cache directory
- mkdir: /usr/local/etc/httpd/proxy/2/G/@: No such file or directory
[Thu Oct 23 20:30:35 1997] proxy: error linking cache file
- link: /usr/local/etc/httpd/proxy/2/G/@/cFQnVidGCEF7152linQ: No such file or directory
[Thu Oct 23 20:36:09 1997] proxy: error creating cache directory
- mkdir: /usr/local/etc/httpd/proxy/W/c/@: No such file or directory
[Thu Oct 23 20:36:10 1997] proxy: error linking cache file
- link: /usr/local/etc/httpd/proxy/W/c/@/@s9PQJTCvqmSKK@b@og: No such file or directory

This fail is caused because a file and/or directory name cannot have a single
"@" as it's name.  In AIX versions 1.X and 2.X, IBM used the single "@" character
as a special type of hidden directory/file.  This was used with the IBM/Locus
Transparent Computing Facility (TCF) code.

The ONLY fails I received from the mod_proxy are when the "@" was going to be
used as a file / directory name.
>How-To-Repeat:
The only way to recreate this fail is to use an AIX 1.X or 2.X system.
>Fix:
I can give you a fix for AIX 1.X.  A slightly different symbol (which I don't
know) would be required for AIX 2.X.  But, the odds of anyone having AIX 2.X
are pretty slim these days, anyway.  A quick fix that doesn't screw up the
hashing function is to use the "%" character in place of the "@" character
on AIX 1.X.  This causes file names and directory names to be created with a
single "%", which has been running for a while now without any fails of any
type being logged.

To fix AIX 1.X, apply the following context diff to apache_1.2.4 source:


*** src/modules/proxy/proxy_util.c-	Fri Oct 24 15:31:02 1997
--- src/modules/proxy/proxy_util.c	Fri Oct 24 15:31:52 1997

 Oh wow.  What a cool misfeature :)  Thanks for the patch.  Is this test: 
 
 #if defined(AIX) && defined(__ps2__)
 ...
 #endif
 
 Sufficient to distinguish AIX 1.x from all other AIXs and operating
 systems?  Or should we maybe -DAIX=1 or 2 (where 2 means > 1) in
 src/Configure, and use that?

 Dean:
 
 The patch you mention below is prefectly adequate to distinguish AIX 1.X from
 the other releases of AIX.  This type of check is used in a lot of software
 and has never given anyone a problem.  I'd go with it, and not try to do anything
 more fancy.  The chances of screwing things up are increased if we try to be more
 clever.
