>Organization:
>Environment:
Server is running on Redhat 6.0.
Client is Netscape 4.5/4.6 or 4.7
>Description:
Module: mod_auth
password files created with htpasswd
Test case 1.) When Netscape authenticates access to a directory the username and password
have to be entered twice before the server authenticates the username.
IE5 in comparison to Netscape does not exhibit this problem.

Test case 2.)
With two useraccounts in the password file... 
entering the first one with the correct password, authentication fails.
Entering the second pair of username and password directly thereafter
creates an internal server error.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up an environment as described above ...
Redhat 6.0
Apache 1.3.9 
use a simple authentication scheme with mod_auth and test with Netscape client
>Fix:
I believe the bug is in mod_auth.c or in one of the functions it calls. 
Probably in the first attempt to authenticate the username or password 
is not read properly into the variables that holds the username or password
so that the authentication fails. On the second attempt the variables are
both filled properly and the user can be authenticated.
