>Description:
I have recently upgraded to 1.2.0, because I was under the impression that this problem would go away (otherwise I was perfectly happy with 1.1.3)
httpd -v = Server version Apache/1.2.0.
httpd -l =Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_browser.c
there is no mod_usertrack or mod_cookies.
I even put CookieTracking off in the httpd.conf file to no avail.

Why do you say cookies are being sent to the client?  The
server at the site you reference does not appear to be 
generating any such cookies.  Are you sure you properly
stopped the old server and started using the new one?

 Actually, this can be closed.  I screwed up stopping the old server,
 so it was still running.  Once I did what I was supposed to do, it
 worked fine.  Thanks for the follow-up.  Sorry to bother
 you.  Great product.
