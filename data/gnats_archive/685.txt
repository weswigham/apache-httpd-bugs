Subject: Apache bug # 503

Hi,

we've resolved the problem with the mod_rewrite module.  With beta 11,
we figured we had better try some things.  Basically, we "promoted" the
rules from a per-directory scope to a per-server scope and now they're
working correctly.  The per-directory scoping worked in beta 6,7,8.

In any case, we're very happy with the whole thing.  The rewrite module
is very to be important to us.

Thanks for the help.
