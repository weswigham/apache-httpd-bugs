Linux 2.0.32 #13 Thu Mar 19 22:19:28 EST 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
Basically, it's something that I consider to be a bug.  If --compat is
included on the ./configure command line, then any --prefix is overridden,
forcing the install directory to /usr/local/apache.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run './configure --prefix /whatever --compat' and you'll see in the 
Makefile that it's going to put it in /usr/local/apache anyways.
>Fix:
I think the problem is on line 359.. prefix='/usr/local/apache'.  I can fix 
it by commenting it out
