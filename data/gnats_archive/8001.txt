>Environment:
FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE i386
gcc
>Description:
Under a very heavy server load, we get an occasional hung child process.  Our
analysis shows that FreeBSD's dynamic linker has just begun its work, having
applied a thread lock, when the Apache child receives a SIGUSR1.  The just_die()
function calls clean_child_exit(), which calls exit().  The exit() function goes
through its __atexit routines, one of which is the dynamic linker termination
function.  This function spins on the original thread lock, and the Apache child
is hung.
>How-To-Repeat:
This bug is extremely hard to replicate, but it can be done using torture.pl
(see http://stein.cshl.org/~lstein/torture/).  It also helps to set
MaxRequestsPerChild to a fairly low number, such as 50.  Then invoke torture.pl
against your test URL, such as 'torture.pl -c 2 -t 100 URL'.  It helps also to
send SIGUSR1 intermittently to the Apache parent process.  The hung child will
generally show up after a couple of hours.  You're trying to hit a pretty small
window in time.
>Fix:
The exit() function should never be called from a signal handler -- it is not
async-safe.  When clean_child_exit() is called from a signal handler such as
just_die(), it should invoke _exit() instead.  It will skip running the __atexit
functions, and the problem is solved.  _exit() is guaranteed async-safe.
