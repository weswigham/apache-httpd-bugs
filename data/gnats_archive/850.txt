>The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of a vulnerability in

>The CERT/CC team recommends installing a patch from your vendor or upgrading

>I.   Description
>
>     Several web browsers support the ability to download JavaScript programs
>     with an HTML page and execute them within the browser. These programs
>     are typically used to interact with the browser user and transmit
>     information between the browser and the Web server that provided the
>     page.
>
>     JavaScript programs are executed within the security context of the page
>     with which they were downloaded, and they have restricted access to
other
>     resources within the browser. Security flaws exist in certain Web
>     browsers that permit JavaScript programs to monitor a user's browser
>     activities beyond the security context of the page with which the
>     program was downloaded. It may not be obvious to the browser user that
>     such a program is running, and it may be difficult or impossible for the
>     browser user to determine if the program is transmitting information
>     back to its web server.
>
>     The vulnerability can be exploited even if the Web browser is behind a
>     firewall (if JavaScript is permitted through the firewall) and even when
>     users browse "secure" HTTPS-based documents.
>
>II.  Impact
>
>     This vulnerability permits remote attackers to monitor a user's browser
>     activity, including:
>
>        * observing the URLs of visited documents,
>        * observing data filled into HTML forms (including passwords), and
>        * observing the values of cookies.
>
>
>III. Solution
>
>     The best solution is to obtain a patch from your vendor or upgrade to a
>     version that is not vulnerable to this problem. If a patch or upgrade is
>     not available, or you cannot install it right away, we recommend
>     disabling JavaScript until the fix is installed.
>
>     A. Obtain and install a patch for this problem.
>
>        We are currently in communication with vendors about this problem.
>        See Appendix A for the current information. We will update the
>        appendix when we receive further information.
>
>     B. Disable JavaScript.
>
>        Until you are able to install the appropriate patch, we recommend
>        disabling JavaScript in your browser. Note that JavaScript and Java
>        are two different languages, and this particular problem is only with
>        JavaScript. Enabling or disabling Java rather than JavaScript will
>        have no affect on this problem.
>
>        The way to disable JavaScript is specific to each browser. The
>        option, if available at all, is typically found as one of the Options
>        or Preferences settings.
