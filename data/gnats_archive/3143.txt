>Description:
When writing a module which needs to add data to the per-connection conn_rec
structure, one finds that it is necessary to add a field to the module
independent src/include/httpd.h file. This is undesirable, because it is
incompatible with the idea of modules being self-contained extensions
>How-To-Repeat:
Try modifying mod_ldap.c to retain both the username and the LDAP Distinguished
Name in the conn_rec to avoid the overhead of an extra LDAP lookup.
>Fix:
Add a simple API to add extension specific data to conn_rec, retrieve a
pointer to it, and clean up on connection closing. This API makes sense for
other structs as well, e.g. the per vhost struct.

E.g, in httpd.h:

struct conn_rec {
	...
	struct extension_data *extdata;
};

struct extension_data {
	struct extension_data *next;
	char *module_name;
	void *data;
}

In src/extensiondata.c:

void *
add_connrec_extensiondata(conn_rec *cr, char *module_name, void *data)
{
	/* link in new field */
}

void *
get_connrec_extension(conn_rec *cr, char *module_name)
{
	/* Retrieve the struct from the linked list */
	return extdatarec->data;
}

In modules/mod_example.c:

	/* Extend conn_rec with our foobar data */
	add_connrec_extension(cr, "mod_example", (void *)foobar);

You get my drift :-)

If there is an appropriate forum to discuss this, please let me know. I'm
pretty new to Apache development. If this idea stands a fighting chance of
being adopted, I'm prepared to do a proof-of-concept first, and then
propose a set of patches to the source tree.
