SunOS infobase2 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-250
gcc v2.8.1
>Description:
When setting Apache up as a reverse proxy using the "ProxyPass" and
"ProxyPassReverse" directives, Apache refuses to cache any data going
through it. The CacheRoot directory is configured, and is writable by the
Apache user, however this directory remains empty. No error messages appear
in any log file reporting the failure of writing of objects to the cache but...

The failure to write to the cache triggers bug PR3178, it seems the filename
of the file the object is being cached under is a NULL string.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up Apache install as a reverse proxy for a website, try enable caching.
>Fix:
