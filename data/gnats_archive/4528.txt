RedHat Linux v6.0
>Description:
Under RedHat Linux 6.0, the file <ndbm.h> is now located in /usr/include/db1 (at least on my system).  The configure script thinks my system has ndbm support but mod_rewrite.h breaks because cpp can't process #include <ndbm.h>.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just run ./configure :-)
>Fix:
Solution:
INCLUDES="-I/usr/include/db1" ./configure [other options]
