>Environment:
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP3
MSVC 5.0
>Description:
If an ISA uses a DLL that's installed in the same directory as the ISA,
isapi_handler()'s LoadLibraryEx() call fails.  Windows pops up a dialog naming
the required DLL and listing the path it searched, which does *not* include the
directory that the ISA is located in.  LoadLibraryEx() is apparently able to
locate the ISA, but not to add its path to its search list.

Running Apache under a debugger reveals that the filename passed to
LoadLibraryEx() uses forward slashes for directory separators. Changing these
to back slashes remedies the problem.

I'm running Apache as a service.  For some reason, this problem does not occur
if Apache is running as an app.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create an ISA that uses an import library to make calls into a DLL.  (This
causes the OS to load the required DLL when the ISA is loaded.)  Install
the ISA and its DLL in one directory (*not* system32 or any directory in the
system's search path).  Then invoke the ISA.
>Fix:
My tested, minimal fix: make a local copy of the filename, change its forward
slashes to back slashes, and pass it to LoadLibraryEx().  A more robust
approach might be to perform this replacement on r->filename any time it's set.
I get the impression that revising sub_canonical_filename() might do the trick,
but I'm not familiar enough with the code to be sure, and it's possible that
this would introduce new problems.

The entire os_canonical_filename processing has been 
rewritten.  Could you give it a try again with the
latest CVS or the next release, and report back?
Thanks!

Ok.  I'm changing the state of the PR back to open.
More investigation is needed on how the DLLs are loaded.

Thanks for getting back to us.

A lot of work has gone into the Windows code since 1.3.6;
can you give it another try?  Thanks!

 I haven't tried 2.0a, but the problem still exists in 1.3.12.

Your report seems to be accurate, as I can reproduce the
first chance exception in the debugger in NTDLL.

It seems very odd, however, very localized to that function,
and a bug within WinNT.

I've applied the / \ transposition you suggest to 1.3.13-dev,
and expect this will resolve the issue.

Thanks for the report and your interest in the Apache
httpd project.
