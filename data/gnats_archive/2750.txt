Slackware Linux 3.5  (Linux 2.0.34)
GCC 2.90.29
Apache 1.3.1
wwwcount 2.4
>Description:
This has been tried on several installations, each shows the same behaviour.
The output gif from the wwwcount2.4 (or 2.3) program is only displayed
some of the time, more often than not it shows as a broken link.

Tested with Netscape 4 and IE 4 - same fault.

>How-To-Repeat:
Since this is a production machine - I'm running 1.2.6 (see below)
>Fix:
I removed Apache 1.3.1 and re-installed 1.2.6

The problem disappears... Sorry guys, this is a weird one!

Can I squeeze in a quick Thank You all message here?  Apache rocks.. I've been
using it for a few years I think now on some mahcines with >100 virtual hosts
and all manner of CGI - it just *WORKS* and is as stable as hell - Thanks :)

Does anything appear in the error log?

What happens if you try just saving the image to disk and
comparing the contents when it works and doesn't?

 It has to be sending something.  If Navigator doesn't show anything, use
 something else.  Can you set it up on a different port so I can see what
 it is doing from here?

 How many virtual hosts are on the machine?  How many child processes are
 typically running?

 No errors are reported in the logs, and I can't save the image to 
 disk when it fails - there simply is no image to save  :(
 
 All works perfectly with Apache 1.2.6   I've tried every browser I 
 can lay my hands on - the only consistent constituent is apache 1.3.1
 though I notice the same problem - though less sever with 1.3.0
