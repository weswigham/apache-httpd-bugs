>Description:
After having done the usual configuration, compilation
and small changes in the *.conf-files, I tried to start
httpd - as usual with the command:

/usr/local/etc/apache/httpd -f /usr/local/etc/apache/conf/httpd.conf

This results in some 50 or so lines as follows:

Cannot open scoreboard file:
/usr/local/etc/apache/logs/apache_status: Permission denied

I have not had this problem with previous versions. I have now
started my 1.2 version of httpd with no problems, even though
I use exactly the same *.conf-files.

What are the permissions on the directory 
/usr/local/etc/apache/logs/?  

Also, could you show us the compile-time flags to GCC, both
for 1.3a1 and 1.2? 

Thanks.

 The httpd-daemon is running as user httpd, member of group www, of which
 
 root also is a member.

 I'll list what I believe to be the relevant parts of the two Makefiles:

 Don't do that.  Anyone who can get the uid httpd or gid www can compromise
 the user that starts Apache, which is normally root.
 
 In http_main.c there are two sections with code like this:
 
     scoreboard_fd = popenf(p, scoreboard_fname, O_CREAT|O_BINARY|O_RDWR, 0644);
     if (scoreboard_fd == -1)
     {
         perror (scoreboard_fname);
         fprintf (stderr, "Cannot open scoreboard file:\n");
         exit (1);
     }
 
 Try removing the O_BINARY| from it, ie. leave it something like:
 
     scoreboard_fd = popenf(p, scoreboard_fname, O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0644);
     if (scoreboard_fd == -1)
     {
         perror (scoreboard_fname);
         fprintf (stderr, "Cannot open scoreboard file:\n");
         exit (1);
     }
 
 Recompile then try starting the server again.

 I tried to do this, but it did not seem to change anything. Still lots
 of lines
 on the screen, complaining about the scoreboard file.

 Looking further, it does appear this is broken.
 
 In http_main.c, find the child_main subroutine.  Move the
 
     reopen_scoreboard(pconf);
 
 line to the line _before_ the first #ifdef MPE line in child_main.  This
 should fix it.  Hopefully.
