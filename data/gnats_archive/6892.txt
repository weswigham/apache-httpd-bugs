Linux ignatius 2.2.17 #5 Fri Oct 6 18:01:46 EDT 2000 i586 unknown
running apache 1.3.14 as distributed by Slackware
>Description:
I have a LAN in which one machine is connected to world via DSL; it masquerades for the machines behind it.  Both this machine (pete) and a machine behind its fw (ignatius) run apache.  Pete port forwards pete:8080 to ignatius:80 so I can access ignatius' httpd when at work.  I disabled UseCanonicalName, to prevent the 8080 from being dropped and to prevent rpg-theory.org from being replaced with ignatius.rpg-theory.org

This works fine, except for the following case:
  while http://rpg-theory.org:8080/~samael/  works,
  http://rpg-theory.org:8080/~samael does not
(note the lack of trailing / on the broken URL)

In the latter case, the port number is dropped and all manner of browser (lynx, MSIE, NS4-6, Opera) attempt to retrieve http://rpg-theory.org/~samael/

I understand that the / is required by spec, but tradition allows it to be dropped.  This seems to be a problem with the implementation of UseCanonicalName, perhaps?

State-Changed-Why:

I think there are some details missing in your problem
report:

1. Are you using mod_proxy to pass the requests
from the external machine to the internal machine?
If so, are you using ProxyPassReverse to assure
that the redirects get properly rewritten?

2. If you aren't using mod_proxy, what technique
are you using to pass the requests?  Whatever technique
it is, it needs to be responsible for rewriting the
trailing-slash redirects to the proper port.

UseCanonicalName is used to assure that Apache uses
the same port that the request came in on.  In this
case, it seems that Apache on the internal machine
is doing exactly the right thing.  The requests are
coming in on port 80, and the redirects are going
out for port 80.

I'm closing this report because you asked the same
question simultaneously in the newsgroup, and you
already have a good response there.  Please use the
bug database only as a last resort.
Thanks for using Apache.
