>Description:
In short: when compiled as documented, the Java portion of Jserv is compiled without optimization.

In the Makefiles that are generated using configure the option $(JAVAC_OPT) is used to set compile flags, however $(JAVACX_OPT) is actually used on the compiler command line.

Therefore, any settings (eg. '-O' or '-g -deprecated') are ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just compile the standard distribution and watch the flags with which javac is launched.
>Fix:
It is hidden somewhere configure.in or acinclude.m4 (aclocal.m4) - I did not study the configure mechanism in detail.

(to fix it for me I just hacked configure)
