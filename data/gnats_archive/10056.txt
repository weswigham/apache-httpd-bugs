>Environment:
Linux 2.4.16, gcc 2.96
>Description:
Receiving SigSev.  In http_request.c, process_request_internal is calling directory walk which at line 535 calls ap_os_is_path_absolute which is located in os-inline.c line 30.  The Seg Fault occurs in os_is_path_absolute.  It appears that the code does not handle a situation in which the entry_dir variable of directory_walk does not contain a value or contains an incorrect value from the per_dir_config of http_core.c  I am receiving this error while running Apache 1.3.22 in proxy mode.  Apache 1.3.23 seems unchanged in this section so I assume that it would happen there as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
It does not appear to have any unique qualities that cause it to happen.
>Fix:
Verify the variable before use.

State-Changed-Why:
What modules are loaded?  What is the specific conf that
applies to this particular request?

It appears that a module has some nasty interaction with
dir_walk, but that code in the 1.3 branch is very stable.
What was the specific request, which handler died, and is
it possible to provide a stack trace?

It's quite possible this is related to the mod_proxy changes,
if I'm reading your comments correctly.  I've reclassed the
bug as such.
