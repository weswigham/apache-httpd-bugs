Its all statically compiled into apache (no DSO).
Apache works fine but when I try to execute the example servlet
"servlets/Hello" y get "Document Contains No Data". That means that
server just disconnected me after I did a "GET" on the servlet.
Log doesn't say anything at all about the error (no exceptions thrown).

Random Behaviour:
After a "restart" of the server SOMETIMES the first GET to the Hello
servlet Works! The followings requests will fail with the disconnection
problem stated above.

>How-To-Repeat:
- Have the same environment as mine setup
- Use the default configuration that comes with the JServ
- Try to make the Hello servlet work (it probably wont).
>Fix:
I tried to get inside a bit into the JServ code. When JServ receives the
client socket he instantiates a BufferedOutputStream for the write stream
of the servlet (here is from where the client should receive the html
response). I tried to do a write() with foo strings and the browser/client
keeps receiving the disconnect problem without the "trash" being received.
Its seems like when the servlet answers the request the httpd already closed the socket on
of the client side.
