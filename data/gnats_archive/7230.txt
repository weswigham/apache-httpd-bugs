State-Changed-Why:
This problem has been reported before.  The a9 release was released
without the test directories, as all Apache releases are.  However,
many of our Makefiles still refer to those directories.  Please
edit the Makefiles, and just remove the test directories.  This
problem has been solved in CVS, and the next release will not
suffer from it.

Thank you for using Apache.
