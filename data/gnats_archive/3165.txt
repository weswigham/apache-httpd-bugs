Linux bk 2.1.108 #2 SMP Thu Jul 2 13:12:08 PDT 1998 i586 unknown

Compiled with gcc version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
We have a directory comprised mainly of cgi scripts that create dynamic web pages.  In Apache v1.2.6 we set the SetHandler cgi-script .cgi in the <Directory> tag as well as set DirectoryIndex index.cgi and have no problems running that.  However in Apache v.1.3.0 those commands did not work on a <Directory> level (I even tried AddHandler) but they did work on a global level.

What we got instead was the server generated direcory index instead of index.cgi and when we clicked on the index.cgi we got the file itself rather than the resulting output if it had been executed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunatly both our servers are production servers and I've had to "fix" the problem by issuing the commands on a global level instead.

State-Changed-Why:
I just tested this in 1.3.3, and it appears to be working.  I
have a few suggestions.  First, your syntax for SetHandler is
wrong, please review the docs for how it should be used.  Second,
if you are getting the text of the cgi document, instead of the
output, that is a config issue.

Please review the docs, and if you are still unable to fix
these issues, post questions to comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.

 I'm sorry I made a mistake...I double checked my configuration files =
 and I'm swapped SetHandler for AddHandler in my report.  I patched my =
 Apache to 1.3.3 and tried it again but it didn't work but I can get it =
 to work by using the same commands but on a global level (srm.conf).  I =
 have double-checked the docs and all of them say it should work in =
 Directory tags and it does work on our Apace 1.2.6 server with no =
 changes to that part of the configuration and I cannot find any =
 documentation stating you changed syntax.
