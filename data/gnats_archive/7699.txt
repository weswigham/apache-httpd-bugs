>Description:
The .htaccess file is not using the supplied AuthUserFile to get usernames/passwords.  It is reverting to the /etc/passwd file on the system.  Here is how my .htaccess file looks
##############################
AuthName "J Cubed Sandbox Members Area"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile "/home/jason/members/Sandbox"

Require valid-user
##############################

Here is the <Directory> entry for this directory:

##############################
<Directory /home/jason/www/members>
  Options All
  AllowOverride All
</Directory>
##############################

I created the password file, /home/jason/members/Sandbox using htpasswd to create a user 'test'.  This user did not work.  To make sure it was reading the correct file, I copied the /etc/passwd file over Sandbox.  I could access the directory with any user I had on the system.  I used htpasswd to add the 'test' user to this file.  It would not work.  I used htpasswd to change the password of an existing user.  The new password would not work, but the system password would still grant me access.

State-Changed-Why:

Please download and compile Apache directly from
http://www.apache.org/dist/

Apache as distributed from this site never has and
never will authenticate out of /etc/passwd.  However,
some hacked versions of Apache distributed by other
vendors may do this.  In particular, I have seen reports
of the Cobalt Cube version of Apache being modified to
authenticate from /etc/passwd.

Thanks for using Apache!
