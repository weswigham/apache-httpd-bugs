>Description:
Hello,
I noticed when I searched bug track that a lot of people are asking 
for a downloadable documentation in the form of .pdf .ps or .doc 
I work for an ISP but also I teach some system and web administration.
As part of my work i converted the documentation on your web site to 
both .doc and .pdf files, and I should have a .ps available this week. 
My question is : Since web material is copyrighted can I freely distribute the 
manuals I cnverted with inclusion of copyright?  What kind of Copyright 
information do I need to inlude in them for the purpose of distributing 
it to people?  Would you like to receive them maybe for a purpose of 
putting them on your web or ftp site?

Sincerely 
Kris Kedzierski
