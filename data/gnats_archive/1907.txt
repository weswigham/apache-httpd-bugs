SunOS saarland 5.5.1 Generic_103640-05 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20
>Description:
I am just playing around with a Non-IP based Apache Server 1.2.5 and
discovered the following
strange behaviour:

I had a ScriptAlias /cgu-bin/ outside the <virtualhost> statements.
Scrips could be run with
http://<domainname>/cgi-bin/script.cgi for all configured
<virtualhost>s. Then I tried to put different
/cgi-bin Aliases into each <virtualhost> enviroment The global
ScriptAlias has been removed.
From now on Apache tried to start the script from
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/cgi-bin/ as the error_log show:

[Wed Feb 25 15:11:18 1998] access to
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/cgi-bin/test.cgi failed for saarland,
reason: File does not exist

Here is are the lines of the <virtualhost> section:


<VirtualHost epsilon.sz-sb.de>

ServerName      epsilon.sz-sb.de
DocumentRoot    /WWW/domains/epsilon/html

CustomLog       /WWW/domains/epsilon/logs/access_log "%h %l %u %t \"%r\"
%>s %b \
"%{referer}i\" \"%{user-agent}i\" %v "
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/           /WWW/domains/epsilon/cgi-bin/

</VirtualHost>

Why does not Apache recognize ScriptAlias inside this section ????

Thanks
Andreas

 It's likely that apache isn't recognizing the virtual host.  Which can be
 for any number of reasons... Have you read the vhost documentation?
 Non-IP virtual hosts changed significantly between 1.2 and 1.3.

 Can you verify that it is in fact recognizing the virtual host that you're
 having the cgi-bin trouble with? 
 
 And you're sure none of your other config files have ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/
 directives? 
 
 For example, the following config works as expected for me.  So there's
 definately something more in your config.

 I am sure I does because this machine is now running as a production
 server with more than 20 non-IP based virtual hosts !
 Do you need more infos ? Maybe our config file ?
 
 Thanks,
 Andreas
