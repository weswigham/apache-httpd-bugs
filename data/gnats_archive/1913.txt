Sun Solaris SPARC5
Compiler: gcc
>Description:
From the FAQ, this error cause that "group directive (conf/httpd.conf) needs to name a group that actually exists in the /etc/group file."  So I made groupid and groupname.

In my /etc/group, I add followling lines,

root::0:root
groupname:password:groupid:memberlist

In my /etc/nsswitch.conf, I add following lines,

group:  files  nisplus

Unfortunately, I still can't start the server.  If you know any other answers or options, please send to me an email..  Thank you.

What happens if you use "Group nogroup" in httpd.conf?

Comment-Added:
You need to have a group numbered 65534, unless you edit the
DEFAULT_GROUP define in httpd.h and recompile.  This is
true even though you may specify another Group in the config file.  I
consider this a bug, but... for some reason others don't.
