>Description:
The problem I am describing has been reported before:
http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/5362
http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/3235

Apologies for coming back to it.
It has now become impossible to index our site.  All it takes is one 
error (bad URL) and the robot can go in an infinite loop.  It is more
worrying because there is no way of identifing where the problem occurs
so the robot cannot be modified ... on this assumption, robots of other 
engines are unlikely to be any better.
>How-To-Repeat:
Real examples
Eg: 
http://www.dundee.ac.uk/links/reference/wwwlink.htm  OK
http://www.dundee.ac.uk/links/reference/wwwlink/dirname/ 
I get wwwlink.htm
http://www.dundee.ac.uk/links/reference/wwwlink/dirname/more/more/more/
I still get wwwlink.html
>Fix:
Having seen your comments to previous reports, if only you could at least provide 
a switch as part of "Includes", to stop or allow "long" urls be processed.
