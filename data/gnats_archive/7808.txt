Apache was built with:
% ./configure 
--enable-so \
--prefix=/home/httpd/apache2 \
--with-mpm=perchild
>Description:
apachectl stop does not halt the server

Here is the scenario:

The value stored in log/http.pid is 16686

Before running apachectl stop, ps -ax | grep "bin/httpd$" displays 44 processes
After running apachectl stop, the same command displays 33 processes
I am using the default settings for perchild

There is more info below.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
..er.. I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but you could explictly kill every process that has a PGID that matches the value stored in logs/httpd.pid???

I have just been using ps -ax | awk '/\/bin\/httpd$ {system ("kill -9 " $1)}'

State-Changed-Why:
I can't reproduce this with the latest build out of CVS.
There have been many improvements since Apache 2.0.16, and
I believe this problem has gone away.  Please let us know
if you are still seeing this, and we will re-open this
PR.

Thank you for using Apache.
