I am running NFS & NIS if this may have something to do with it.

Here is what is getting put in the error_log:

[Mon Dec 22 13:52:43 1997] fcntl: F_SETLKW: No record locks available
[Mon Dec 22 13:52:43 1997] - Error getting accept lock. Exiting!

Every time we get a hit another error is added.  It's already filled up our
file system twice! This is a production site. Can you help me try and
track this down? What do I have to do to the configuration to cause apache
to stop this particular error?

I tried recompiling with these options, thinking it might have something
to do with the mutex problem (i.e. listener...):

-DUSE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

AND

-DUSE_FNCTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

But it didn't solve the problem.

Please help.

This error never occured in previous versions.

State-Changed-Why:
If you had searched the bugdb for something odd like
F_SETLKW you would have found dozens of reports of
similar things and the fixes.

Use something like "LockFile /var/tmp/accept.lock" in
your config file to move the lockfile to a non-NFS partition.
NFS file locking isn't.
