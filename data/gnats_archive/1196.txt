>Description:
Using <Limit HEAD GET POST> which is valid in NCSA causes an Internal Server Error in Apache 1.3a1.

A comment on the same line as an "allow from" type line causes authentication to fail.  Example:

allow from 127.0.0.1       # this comment works in NCSA but not Apache

State-Changed-Why:
You raised two issues:

 1. <Limit HEAD GET POST> does not work because HEAD is
    not a valid method here. Limiting GET is sufficient to
    limit HEAD as well. As far as I can tell, NCSA works
    the same here (although perhaps it silently ignores
    the invalid HEAD argument?). 
    (See http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/access/Limit.html)
    The Apache documentation should be updated to reflect this.
    Of course the best way to restrict all methods is
    to omit the <Limit> and </Limit> lines altogether.

 2. Comments are not valid on the same line as a directive.
    There is no suggestion anywhere in the documentation that
    they are valid here. Put the comment on a separate line.
