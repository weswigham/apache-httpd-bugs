and linux 2.2.16-3
>Description:
We're running a apache w/ mod_proxy.  The httpd.conf file has the following:

ProxyRequests On
<Directory proxy:*>
order deny,allow
allow from all
AuthName "blah"
AuthType Basic
PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthenSession
require valid-user
</Directory>

Everything's works fine till we try to proxy a web catalogue system which generates
%3 in their URL.  This causes the server to generate a 400 Bad Request error.

This seems to happen w/ apache servers (tried it with 1.3.9)
For example:
> telnet www.apache.org 80
GET /%3 HTTP/1.0
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2000 22:08:49 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) ApacheJServ/1.1 PHP/3.0.12 AuthMySQL/2.20
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html


With Netscape Enterprise:
> telnet  www.ucpress.edu 80
Connected to www.ucpress.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /%3 HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 404 Not found
Server: Netscape-Enterprise/3.6 SP2
Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2000 22:06:52 GMT
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 207
Connection: close

>How-To-Repeat:
Do a 
GET /%3 HTTP/1.0

on site running apache and compare it w/ sites running other servers.
