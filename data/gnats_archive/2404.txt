I want to make possible simple search.

I tried to use diferent CGI-scripts, but they generate the same error:

"Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable
to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, karlo@lanet.lv and inform them of
the time the error occurred, and anything you
might have done that may have caused the error."

Before Apache server I have used MS IIS v 1 as a web server. Script 'Mekle.dll' 
(http://priede.bf.lu.lv/Search2.html) and it works fine.

 Here it is:
 
 [Wed Jun 17 07:34:04 1998] [error] (8)Exec format error: couldn't spawn 
 child process: e:/www/system/scripts/mekletaji/mekle.dll
 
 "mekle.dll" is pre-compiled binary. In problem report I have mentioned 
 other scripts as well. These files are text format scripts. The problem with 
 these other scripts was my fault - the wrong pointer to perl 
 interpretator was included.
 
 Best regards,
 
 karlis

 Erm... DLLs are not generally standalone executables.  Does it run (even
 if it doesn't run properly) if you try to execute it from the command
 line?

  No, it looks like somebody has written something very special for MS IIS. 
 Sorry.
 
 It looks like this problem report has to be closed. 
 
 Thank You for Your time. 
 
 Karlis
 
 P.S. I have one related question:
 
 1. Is there any search capabilities built in Apache Server?
