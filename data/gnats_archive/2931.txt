I have the following mod_rewrite rule set

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} -U
RewriteRule ^/(.*)	http://otherhost/$1 [P]

It doesn't work properly. Here is the rewrite log:

172.16.0.4 - - [31/Aug/1998:10:44:56 -0400] [www.redshift.cimedia.com/sid#80b14cc][rid#80cbb44/initial] (2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /foo/bar
172.16.0.4 - - [31/Aug/1998:10:44:56 -0400] [www.redshift.cimedia.com/sid#80b14cc][rid#80cbb44/initial] (3) applying pattern '^/(.*)' to uri '/foo/bar'

172.16.0.4 - - [31/Aug/1998:10:44:56 -0400] [www.redshift.cimedia.com/sid#80b14cc][rid#80cbb44/initial] (4) RewriteCond: input='/foo/bar' pattern='!-U' => not-matched

I assure you that /foo/bar does not exist on this server, yet the RewriteCond
is getting back a 200 as the result of its subreq lookup. I have confirmed
this behavior under both 1.2.6 and 1.3.1.

Here's a grab at a document that DOES exist on the server:

172.16.0.4 - - [31/Aug/1998:10:47:49 -0400] [www.redshift.cimedia.com/sid#80b14cc][rid#80cbb44/initial] (2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /index.html

172.16.0.4 - - [31/Aug/1998:10:47:49 -0400] [www.redshift.cimedia.com/sid#80b14cc][rid#80cdb54/subreq] (2) init rewrite engine with requested uri /index.html

Same results.

 Argh. I figured this out I think. Unfortunately, the '-U' switch
 doesn't check for the existance of a document, it just checks to see
 if the URL is valid (meaning it passes auth and access checks, is in a
 document root or aliased, etc). You have to actually do a run_sub_req
 to find out if the document is servable, and that then serves the
 document, which is not what we want.
 
 What we do want is the ability to proxypass every URL that fails on
 the local server to a remote server. The local server acts as a stage,
 so any content that is missing on the stage needs to get filled in
 from the live server. We need to be able to do this for <!--#include
 virtual's as well though, so it can't be done just by a CGI error
 document processor. (And in fact can't be done by mod_rewrite either
 since it doesn't allow for proxy'ing sub_req's, though we've locally
 removed that restriction from the code.)
 
 There isn't really a good way to do this other than doing a bunch of
 -f and -d checks, and that is a pain.
