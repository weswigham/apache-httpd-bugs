apache
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.13 RedHat 6.1 Apache 1.3.9 from RedHat rpm
>Description:
I have 1 A name and 2 CNAME's for my box. Internally the box is named as a node in a subdomain from one of the CNAME's.
(habitrail.home.fools-errant.com)
Note that www.fools-errant.com actually resolves someplace else. However, removing that virtual host and restarting changed nothing.

I set up name virtual hosts in the config file. The config file is the vanilla file supplied by RedHat, I added:

NameVirtualHost 216.41.5.170

<VirtualHost 216.41.5.170>
ServerAdmin webmaster@www.hacksaw.org
DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/hacksaw
ServerName hacksaw.org
ServerAlias *.hacksaw.org
ErrorLog logs/error-log.hacksaw.org
TransferLog logs/access-log.hacksaw.org
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 216.41.5.170>
ServerAdmin webmaster@www.privatecircus.com
DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/privatecircus
ServerName privatecircus.com
ServerAlias *.privatecircus.org
ErrorLog logs/error-log.privatecircus.org
TransferLog logs/access-log.privatecircus.org
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 216.41.5.170>
ServerAdmin webmaster@www.fools-errant.com
DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/fools-errant
ServerName fools-errant.com
ServerAlias *.fools-errant.com
ErrorLog logs/error-log.fools-errant.com
TransferLog logs/access-log.fools-errant.com
</VirtualHost>


I have only the one httpd.conf. The output from the -S option

habitrail:/etc/httpd/conf
hacksaw > httpd -S
VirtualHost configuration:
216.41.5.170:80        is a NameVirtualHost
                       default server hacksaw.org (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:342)
                       port 80 namevhost hacksaw.org (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:342)
                       port 80 namevhost privatecircus.com (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:351)
                       port 80 namevhost fools-errant.com (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:360)

The browser I am checking it with is Netscape 4.7 and lynx 2.8.1rel.2. The lynx is running on a host on a different network.

Running strace on the httpd -X run reveals the browser is send a well formed Host: header,
(i.e. "Host: www.hacksaw.org")

My net connection is an SDSL line, with the router doing NAT. No one else is running a web server on my network, I'm running just apache on one box.

 In given conf entry 
 
 ServerName privatecircus.com  -- 2 octets address
 ServerAlias *.privatecircus.org --  3 octets address
 
 Make the both entry in equal number of octets address
 and do the correction in Domain Name Server A & CNAME
 entry.
 Or 
 
 modify the ServerAlias entries like  
 
 ServerAlias hacksaw.org *.hacksaw.org
 
 Sample DNS and httpd.conf entry as follows:
 
 DNS entry :
 
 xxx  IN A 216.41.5.170
 
 x1 IN CNAME xxx
 x2 IN CNAME xxx
 
 Httpd.conf entry:
 
 NameVirtualHost 172.16.1.101
 
 <VirtualHost 172.16.1.101>
 ServerAdmin ZZZ@mail.kovaiteam.com
 ServerName x1.kovaiteam.com
 DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs

 <VirtualHost 172.16.1.101>
 ServerAdmin yyy@mail.kovaiteam.com
 ServerName x2.kovaiteam.com
 DocumentRoot /usr/local/JSDT-2.0/ViConnect
 </VirtualHost>     
 
 With above changes here it is working fine.

 The length of address thing makes no sense to me. I tried it, because I'll be 
 the first to admit that occasionally things are non-intuitive, but why should 
 apache care how many sections the name had? It should not.
 
 The documentation on ServerAlias is pretty sparse as well.
 
 In any case it fails just as ably if I comment out the ServerAlias lines 
 entirely.
 
 I did have a misspelling, there is no privatecircus.org, but correcting it 
 solves nothing.

 I am also having this problem with RedHat 6.1 and the Apache versions
 1.3.9 and 1.3.12
 
 I wonder if anyone has determined a workaround?
