>Environment:
Amdahl's UTS 2.1.2 with ANSI C compiler version 2.7.5 (8/4/94)
>Description:
The assembler of the ANSI C compiler on UTS sometimes bombs on apache source
files.  Before apache 1.3.6 it has only happened in optional modules and I
just skipped compiling them.  With the latest release, it is bombing in
the required http_protocol.c so I investigated further for a workaround.
It turns out that removing the second "const" from the status_lines array
definition is the easiest way, although it can also be avoided by splitting
the existing code into two separate files.  I chose to use the easy way.
This is such an obscure problem that I wouldn't blame you if you don't want
to incorporate it into the base, but I thought I would submit it anyway just
in case.

You'll have to trust me.
