I can't figure out why/how/etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Constantly happening. I can supply httpd.conf to someone if necessary.  I don't know
if its something in the HTML, something in the config, what. I've upgraded the server
and its still happening.
>Fix:
No, I can't find in the code where its happening. I see no "undefined".

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Apr  4 22:33:31 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Well, something is telling clients to request that file, 
so they do, so Apache does what it does when a file doesn't exist.

It could well be some javascript that is using an undefined
variable, which gets translated into a text string "undefined"
(gotta love weakly typed languages).

You may be able to figure out what page it is by logging referers
in the access logs (see the docs).  Or you may not.

Either way, nothing to do with Apache...
