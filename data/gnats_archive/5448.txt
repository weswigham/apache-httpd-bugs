Apache 1.3.9
Raven SSS 1.4.1
JRun 2.3.2
>Description:
Cannot get the servlets to be called via apache since loading the SSL stuff.  I have configured the DSO stuff, and reloaded the apache and JRUN.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The suggestion is that I run apxs -o mod_jrun.so *.c
I have however loaded this in via DSO.  Will now running the apxs have any adverse effect.
Will it solve the JRUN problem?
