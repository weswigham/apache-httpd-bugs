Excerpt from error_log:

[Thu Jun  5 21:48:34 1997] access to /usr/data/web/newfree/redirect.cgi failed f
or pigdog.wws.net, reason: couldn't spawn child process

I'm trying to run a very simple redirect cgi script,
and 9 out of 10 times I get an error.

racer.wws.net/newfree/redirect.cgi?www.cnn.com (for example)
>Fix:
No!  It works fine when the server is first started, but then fails every time!  Help%2

State-Changed-Why:
You are likely running into either file descriptor or 
number of processes per user limits imposed by your OS.

If you are running numerous virtual hosts, see 
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#fdlim

If not, then check the output of a "ulimit -u" which
shows how many processes each user can run.  If it
is low, try doing a "ulimit -u unlimited" as root before
starting the server.
