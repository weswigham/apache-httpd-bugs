RedHat Linux 5.0 (with most up-to-date patches)  and Redhat 4.2
>Description:
Apache 1.2.5 and apache 1.3 on Redhat 5.0 acts as a web proxy to the Internet, 
client machines (linux, Solaris) use netscape-communicator 4.05 to access the apache proxy.
Apache report wrong client login name when IdentityCheck is turned on.

About half of the connection was logged as from user root of the client machines,
when root is not even logged in.
>How-To-Repeat:
On machine A (linux or Solaris), use netscape to access 
web through an apache proxy on machine B with IdentityCheck turned on.
Machine B will report most of the connection as openned by root, even
root is not running any browser.

State-Changed-Why:
If the client is going through a proxy, the end server
only sees the connexion from the proxy host.  Thus any
RFC1413 identd lookup on the connexion will result in
a query being sent to the proxy, not to the originating
client.  And since the proxy server is started as root,
that's what identd on the proxy host is going to return.
Why would you expect otherwise?  Proxies don't typically
forward RFC1413 requests through to the origin client.

[More from submitter]
Hi:

I examed the source code, and got the following findings.

In normal HTTP access to local file system, the rfc1413 was called by
auth mod. This is still at an earlier stage of processing of the
request, so the client machine, upon receiving the Identd check,  was
able to locate its end of the tcp/ip connection, and properly reply the
user id who owns that port.

But in proxy mode, the Auth module was some how skipped, so the Identd
check is left until the process reached log modules. I believe that it
was too late for log module to ask the client machine for the remote
user ID. When HTTP connection in question is closing,  it's impossible
for the client machine to respond when the FIN packet of the HTTP
connection was sent.

I inserted a rfc1413 call to get the remote user ID into the
ap_read_request () function, just after it constructed all the request
record. The problem is thus fixed as the rfc1413 request is early
enough. Yet, my solution doesn't seems to be a gracious one.  Any advice
of where should do the remote ID check in the proxy module?

Thanks
Fu Ming
