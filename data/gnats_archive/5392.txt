Windows NT 4 (service pack 5), Sun JDK 1.2.2, JSDK 2.0, MS SQL Server 7.0
>Description:
On every servlet request I get an alert box with the heading "java.exe - Application Error". This only happens with Apache/JServ (not whern I use JavaWebServer 2.0). The text of the alert box reads "The instruction at 0x412346c5 refernced memory at 0x412346c5. The memory could not be 'read'". After I click OK, it goes away. This alert appears after the servlet completes its processing and the servlet seems to work perfect (page displays as it should). As I said before, I never get this with JavaWebServer 2.0. From what I can remember, this error also happens on several other servlet engines such as JRun. Any ideas on what is causing this?

State-Changed-Why:
JWS uses its own JVM.

If you are seeing this problem with other servlet engines
(ie: jrun), then why do you think this is an Apache JServ issue? It is obviously and issue with the JVM installation or some other error on your box. Try re-installing the JVM.

this definitely isn't an apache jserv issue or bug.
