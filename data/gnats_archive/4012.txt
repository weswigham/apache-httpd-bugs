>Environment:
OS/2 v4 running the provided binary: httpd.exe.
>Description:
'file util_os2.c line 22 assertion failed' is being logged in error log and a core dump is taking place.
The server never sends the page to the browser.  This only happens when using an SHTML page with standard SSI
statements such as #if, #else, #endif, #echo, etc.  Server performs fine with standard HTML.  Previous version,
v1.3.3 executable does not experience the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have a specific SHTML page that can make it happen every time, but I haven't been able to pinpoint which code may be causing the problem yet.
>Fix:
Not yet.

State-Changed-When: Sat May  8 08:22:53 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
The assert was triggered by an invalid file name.
As of v1.3.6 an appropriate error message should now be
logged instead.
