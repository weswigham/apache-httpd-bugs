>Description:
"ExtendedStatus on" returns a syntax error in the config file if mod_status is compiled shared and the ExtendedStatus keyword comes before the LoadModule directive.

There is already a bug report on this (3936) but it appears as if the problem wasn't fixed, or maybe it's just in this case (shared module).
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with status as shared module.
Put "ExtendedStatus on" before the "LoadModule" directive.
Attempt to start Apache and see error message.
>Fix:
Fairly simple to fix this one bug.  Other ideas include:

* Create a full list of all reserved keywords for Apache config and allow all keywords to at least exist in the config file regardless of whether they are "allowed" (ie, don't barf with "syntax error")

* Do 2 passes on the config file, one to check basic syntax and appropriate modules and the second to check usage and such
