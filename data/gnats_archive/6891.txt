AIX 4.2.1.0, xlC.C 3.1.4.0 and native AIX make. Now I have a gnu gcc-2.95 and a gnu make-3.78.1.
>Description:
I am trying compiling an apache-1.3.14 with an php-3.0.17 support on AIX 4.2.1.0. PHP is configured with mysql support using php installation guide. Compilation is finished successfuly and when I try starting up httpd, it doesn't start. Compilation without php is done successfuly and httpd starts well. I have xlC.C 3.1.4.0 and native AIX make. Now I have got a gnu gcc-2.95 and a gnu make-3.78.1 and result is same.


Please help me

P.S. Sorry for my English language. I am beginner.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Probably this is an AIX, or PHP specific problem with special options for compilation.

Sorry, but I will need to ask you to take this
problem to the PHP site: http://www.php.net/.
This database is only for reporting bugs in
the Apache HTTP Server.
Thanks for using Apache!
