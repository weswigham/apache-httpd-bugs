>Description:
So as not to run 'analog' on our main server our CGIs indirectly call 'rsh'
to offload the job onto another server.  Since upgrading to 1.2.4 we've had
problems where reports would abort prematurely, with no HTML document
returned.

Log symptoms would include lines such as 'rsh: select: bad file number', indicating that the Apache server had closed the output socket.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Defining USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT (although supposedly only related to problems on new listening sockets) appears to have cured the problem

State-Changed-Why:
I do find it somewhat odd that USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
would do anything.

Are you sure nothing else changed when you did this?

Is it easy to reproduce the problem?  ie. even if it doesn't
happen every other time, can you always make it happen
by making a number of requests?

Do you have a lot of virtual hosts?  How many total
Listen directives + logfiles do you have?  Could you
be running out of file descriptors?  It is possible
rsh is picky and doesn't like high file descriptors.

 There shouldn't have been any other changes, it was exactly the same build
 tree as I normally use but with the #define added in conf.h.

 In order to determine the answer to some of your questions I've just
 started the old binary back up and am now unable to duplicate the problem. 
 I'll monitor the situtation and see if we can determine at what point
 the problem reoccurs.
 
 When the problem was apparent we found that one request would work, and
 then we wouldn't be able to make the script work for ages, and then it
 would just start working again for a few requests.

 I'm currently running 159 virtual servers, 'lsof' reports about 172 fds
 per process.  I had considered that lack of file descriptors might be a
 problem but Digital Unix has a getdtablesize() of 4096 and I also tested
 that sizeof(fd_set) is actually big enough to hold that many fds (it is). 
 
 I've only got two listen directives, a global 'Listen 80' and a single-IP
 'Listen xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:443' for a single SSL virtual server.
 
 Ray.
