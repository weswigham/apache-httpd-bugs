>Environment:
SunOS fsinfo 4.1.3 1 sun4c unknown, gcc version 2.8.1
with Apache 1.3.4 PHP/3.0.6
(Also tested it with Apache 1.2.1 PHP/FI-2.0b12 and 1.3.6 mod_macro/1.1.1 on
 other machines)
>Description:
The query string of an http request to a type map is not passed to the SSI 
document, which is selected by content negotiation.

An example:

request: 
GET /~abe/test/test.var?test HTTP/1.0

type map test.var contains: (Also tried it with text/x-server-parsed-html)
---8<---
URI: test.shtml
Content-type: text/html
--->8---

In test.shtml there is a printenv SSI command, which shows among other lines:
QUERY_STRING=

So the query string is not passed to the SSI document called via content
negotiation.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~abe/test/test.var?test
(Apache 1.3.4 with the above type map.)

http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/test.var?test
(Apache 1.3.6 with same type map)
