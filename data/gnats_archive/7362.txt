I added an empty 'all' target to the empty Makefile in srclib/apr-util/test and it goes for a while, but fails with 

Making all in test
make[1]: Entering directory `/dvl/sw/nt/apache/2.0a9/apache_2.0a9/test'
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/dvl/sw/nt/apache/2.0a9/apache_2.0a9/test'
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1                

add another all in 

/dvl/sw/nt/apache/2.0a9/apache_2.0a9/test/Makefile

Is it valid that these makefiles are mostly empty and have nor all rule ???

./configure --prefix /dvl/sw/nt/apache/2.0a9
