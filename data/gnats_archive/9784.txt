>Description:
The ChildPerUID and AssignUserID directives assume the user/group are specified with numeric uid/gid. This is confusingly different than the User/Group directives. 

Since these use atoi() blindly, using an alphabetic username results in the virtual host running as root!

It should not be possible to run servers as root without defining BIG_SECURITY_HOLE as with the User directive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the perchild module. Add to the main configuration "ChildPerUID user group 1" (alphabetic user/group). Add to a virtual host "AssignUserID user group". It will not do what you'd expect.
>Fix:
I've got a patch that makes the behavior more like the User directive.
