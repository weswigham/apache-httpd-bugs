>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.14, mod_jserv 1.1.1, ibm jdk118
>Description:
Since mod_jserv 1.1.1 get_param() in jserv_balance.c scans r->uri instead
of r->args for the JServSessionId. But the Uri does not contain the
Request-Params, the SessionId is not found. Thus the load balancer can not
determine the correct ajpv-Server, load balancing fails. This happens
only if you don't use cookies and have the Session URLencoded.
>How-To-Repeat:
Do some load balancing without(!) cookies, it will fail, sessions will not be
continued.
>Fix:
The old code from 1.1 (which is still there, but commented out) works
fine.
