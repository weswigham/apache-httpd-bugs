>Description:
The "apache-1.3" collection differs between the CVS and CVSup
repositories.

If apache-1.3 is checked out using anonymous CVSup, only the "src"
subdirectory is retrieved. I believe that this is a mistake, and
CVSup should retrieve the complete apache distribution. As far as I
can tell, retrieving the complete apache-1.3 is not possible with
CVSup.

Here is my supfile:

-START
*default tag=.
*default host=apache.org
*default prefix=/usr/home/tom/apache/
*default base=/usr/home/tom/
*default release=cvs
*default delete use-rel-suffix compress

mod-perl
apache-1.3
apache-1.3-docs
-END
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the supfile above with "cvsup supfile", replacing /usr/home/tom with an appropriate
directory.

You should find that the "src" directory is retrieved, rather than the complete
apache-1.3.
>Fix:
Fix the repository, or perhaps clarify the docs at http://dev.apache.org if
I've misunderstood something, and my configuration is wrong.

Thanks (and Merry Christmas!),
Tom
