Although the problem is probably not dependent on any of these
>Description:
in a non-root working environment, where more than one user
may be willing to run a private instance of apache on one 
machine, the current default pid file naming leads to clashes.
>How-To-Repeat:
On one and the same machine start two instances of apache
$ httpd -f <httpd:8000.conf>
$ httpd -f <httpd:8001.conf>
, where both config files contain the line with the ``PidFile'' 
directive unchange from the default.

You will experience, that one apache instance overwrites the PidFile of the 
other instance /*last one wins*/.


>Fix:
I suggest to replace the PidFile directive in httpd.conf by
the [new] default

# PidFile: The file the server for Port 80 should log its pid to
PidFile /var/run/httpd:80.pid

.  I think, this would give thinking of any non-root apache
configurer the right direction.

Since for every machine, there cannot be more than one webserver 
instance per port, this naming scheme should be unique.

State-Changed-Why:
There certainly can be more than one PID file per port and,
on many machines, there is.  I really don't see that it is
necessary to change the default PID file.  It would add
considerable confusion for people running one server that
listens to multiple ports and wouldn't really solve the
problem that you describe, since people can have web servers
using the same port on different IPs.

I don't think it is unreasonable to simply expect peple to
be able to configure each instance of their webserver to
what whatever unique files are necessary.
