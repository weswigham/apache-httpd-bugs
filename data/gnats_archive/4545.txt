>Description:
No documented or predictable combination of require, allow, deny or SetEnvIf
achieves access control based on the response from the RFC1413 IdentityCheck.

Congratulations for reading this far - I appreciate your openmindedness.
Yes, I know that ident can be spoofed by anyone with administrator privileges
or with network level access.  Yes, I know that ident is of limited value on
the internet.  However, it remains that ident is a useful technology on an
intranet or extranet.  Limitations on it's use should be in the documentation
not the software.

Obviously the facility should be documented as only worth using in combination
with host address based access control between hosts you control over networks
you control.  I will undertake to write the required documentation if that will
improve the chances of the patch being adopted (and if I can grok the format).

The only problem I can see with this change is with the special logname
"unknown".  There is no way outside the core logname code to distinguish between
<no-reply-from identd> and "unknown" sent by identd.  It would be nice to move
the "unknown" string constant to the logging modules, or to make it user-
definable.  However, if this potential source of confusion is ignored, the
command sequence here works with the patch below.
>How-To-Repeat:
In httpd.conf:
SetEnvIf Remote_Ident unknown noidentsupplied
deny from env=noidentsupplied
>Fix:
A patch to mod_setenvif.c achieves a fairly good fix, but leaves the problem
with the "unknown" special value unanswered:

State-Changed-Why:

In the Apache model, access checking occurs before
authentication and authorisation checking -- and all
of these occur before content handling.  So the
information should never reach a CGI script, for
instance, because the access decision should have
been made much earlier.

You might check out the mod_access_identd module, which
is available from <http://Web.MeepZor.Com/packages/>.

 Dear Ken,

 Thanks for the pointer!  This is one possible solution to
 my problem, although I still think that the mod_setenvif
 change is worthwhile.  I'm worried that a change to the
 semantics of the "allow" and "deny" commands make the
 MeepZor module a source of confusion for anyone who
 inherits my web config files.  The mod_setenvif patch is
 more localised and does not change the way the old familiar
 NCSA commands work.

 I don't understand the relevance of this response.
 I believe the patch I attached to this bug report does the job.
 With the config fragment I gave as the How-To-Repeat it successfully
 limited access based on the response from identd.
 
 Are you saying that the patch doesn't work?
 Are you saying that mod_setenvif is the wrong place to do this?
 Are you saying that this feature should not be part of the
 standard distribution?
 
 Hope you can clarify.
 
 Thanks,

This is a reasonable thing to do, so I'll add it to my
