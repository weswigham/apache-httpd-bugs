State-Changed-When: Tue Jun 30 15:35:13 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Make sure that the file has the same permissions as the
error_log file, and stop and restart the server.  If the
server hasn't been restarted, it won't know about the new
file.  If this doesn't fix your problem, reply to this
message according to the bracketed instructions in it.
