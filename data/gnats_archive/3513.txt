Hi,

I compile and package lots of freeware for AIX. I was surprised that there
wasn't already a binary distribution for AIX (or any others).

Anyway, for your information, my binary package is available from
http://www-frec.bull.com/

Thanks,
Ciaran

 Wow, that's an impressive collection of binaries. I can't believe
 that I missed the path to them.
 
 I'm equally impressed that you're offering an LPP for aix, using my own
 tools and all. Double wow.
 
 So I should "kill" the LPP I built for the version 1.3.3, and just put
 your binary on my server (or a link to your site).
 
 The approach I used to package the LPP I built resulted in a slightly
 smaller package, maybe for the v1.3.4 something can be reused?
 
 Bye
 Ciaran
