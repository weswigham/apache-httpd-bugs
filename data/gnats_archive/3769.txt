>Description:
I have an apache and an IIS running with the same directory mappings (doc and script).
With apache I can not access a document with the following URL:
http://ntzeus/docus/jws/jws12/com.sun.server.http.pagecompile.sgmlparser.SGMLTagsParserBase.html
Result is a Forbidden (permission error). The files have the same permissions
(Full for everyone).
If I access the same file with the IIS (port 81):
http://ntzeus:81/docus/jws/jws12/com.sun.server.http.pagecompile.sgmlparser.SGMLTagsParserBase.html
I doesn't get an error.

If I rename the file from:
com.sun.server.http.pagecompile.sgmlparser.SGMLTagsParserBase.html
To:
com.html
I can not access it.

But if I rename it to bom.hml it works.

I have 524 files starting with "com."

Other pages work well.

 Output in error.log:
 Apache: [Tue Jan 26 14:49:49 1999] [error] [client 10.0.1.21] Filename is
 not valid:

 A "dir" command call shows that the file exists.

State-Changed-When: Sat Jan 30 11:20:19 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This was not actually related to the dots in the filename.
From 1.3.4, Apache checks that the requested filename
does not include a DOS device name, such as AUX or NUL,
which can cause hard crashes when accessed. It should
have also checked for COM1 thru COM4, but due to a bug
this check actually matched "COM", thus denying access
to your files.

This will be fixed in the next release.
