Naturally, I'm using the version of gcc and make that came 
with RedHat Linux 5.1 so there should not be any version problems
as you suggested in the FAQ.  

Any ideas?

Thanks.

 Are you adding any extra modules or linking against any extra libraries?
 
 Can you compile _anything_ on the box?
 
 This really looks like a seriously broken compiler...
 
 Try just running "gcc helpers/dummy.c".  If that doesn't work, then your
 compiler is broken and there is nothing we can do about that...

 Marc,
 
 I followed your advice and re-installed all of the C devel tools that came
 with RedHat and I'm compiling like a champ!!!!! I've got Apache with SSL
 working great.  My big problem now is getting Apache/SSL to properly
 recognize client certs but that's a more complex problem.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Ed
