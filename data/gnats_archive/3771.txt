uname -a = Linux pworcester 2.0.36 #16 Sun Jan 10 08:36:27 EST 1999 i686

gcc -v = Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-linux-libc5/2.8.1/specs

>Description:
When setting up user authentication with .htaccess, after the userid and password
are accepted, the browser (Netscape 3.01 on both hp-ux 9.05 or Linux 2.036) 
replies with "Document contains no data".

If I remove the "require valid-user" directive, I can see the contents of the directory.

.htaccess contains;

AuthName "Secure Directory"
AuthType  Basic
AuthUserFile /root/public_html/.htpasswd
require valid-user

httpd.conf contains;

UserDir public_html

<Directory /root/public_html>

        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride ALL
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all

</Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
set-up public_html dir and compile apache for glibc2.0.7 libraries.

This does not happen on a libc5 system.

 I haven't revisited it.  I'm not running redhat. 
 This is a slackware with kernel 2.036, gcc 2.81,
 glibc-2.0.7

State-Changed-Why:
Well I mentioned redhat/glibc to indicate that it does work
on at least one glibc system.  I'm not sure what the problem is
with yours... but I'm tempted to say that it's a slackware
specific bug.  If you do find out that apache is at fault
I'd like to hear... but I'm going to close this out for now,
sorry.

thanks for choosing apache!
