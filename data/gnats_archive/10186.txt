Darwin 5.3 (Mac OS X 10.0.3)
Darwin Kernel Version 5.3: Thu Jan 24 22:06:02 PST 2002; root:xnu/xnu-201.19.obj~1/RELEASE_PPC  Power Macintosh powerpc
>Description:
    The apache 2.0.32 beta release does not build automatically in Darwin >= 5.3 (Mac OS X >= 10.1.x). 

    Affected files:
srclib/apr/libtool
srclib/apr-util/xml/expat/libtool
>How-To-Repeat:
make  (will not build complete)
>Fix:
The correct libtool(s) should contain:
<correct-libtool-code>
# Flag that allows shared libraries with undefined symbols to be built.
allow_undefined_flag="-flat_namespace -undefined warning"
</correct-libtool-code>

Note: Apple introduced some changes in the linker & runtime environment (two-level namespaces), reference:

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: jim
State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 26 06:12:09 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
In most cases libtool is generated automatically. There are 2 real solutions if building from CVS. The first is to grab a later version of libtool and place in /usr/local on Darwin. The other is to edit /usr/share/libtool/ltconfig and look for 'allow_undefined_flag' line in the darwin/rhapsody section and change to:

   allow_undefined_flag='-undefined warning -flat_namespace'
