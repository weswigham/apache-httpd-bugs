NT 4.0, jdk1.2.2,
>Description:
Under IE 4.0, everything works fine and redirection is quick. However, under
Netscape 4.61, it takes about 4-6 seconds before the redirected page is
displayed.

If I use another Servlet engine (e.g. JRun), this problem doesn't occur.
>How-To-Repeat:
TestServlet.java:
---------------------
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
throws ServletException, IOException {
  resp.setContentType("text/html");
  PrintWriter out = resp.getWriter();
  out.println("<HTML><HEAD>");
  out.println("<TITLE>HTML directory");
  out.println("</TITLE></HEAD><BODY TEXT=\"#800000\"
BGCOLOR=\"#FEFBEB\"><FORM METHOD=\"POST\" >");
  out.println("<BR><INPUT TYPE=\"SUBMIT\" VALUE=\"Test redirect\"
NAME=\"Test redirect\">");
  out.println("</FORM></BODY></HTML>");
  out.close();
}
public void doPost(final HttpServletRequest req,
       HttpServletResponse resp)
  throws ServletException, IOException {
  int port = req.getServerPort();
  String abs = req.getScheme() + "://" + req.getServerName() +
     (port == 80 ? "" : ":"+port) + "/servlet/HelloServlet";
  System.err.println( "Redirecting to: " + abs + " resp class name:" +
resp.getClass().getName());
  resp.sendRedirect( abs );
}
}
----------------
HelloServlet.java
-------------------

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
throws ServletException, IOException {
  resp.setContentType("text/html");
  PrintWriter out = resp.getWriter();
  out.println("<HTML><HEAD>");
  out.println("<TITLE>Hi there");
  out.println("</TITLE></HEAD><BODY TEXT=\"#800000\"
BGCOLOR=\"#FEFBEB\"><FORM METHOD=\"POST\" >");
  out.println("Hi there </FORM></BODY></HTML>");
  out.close();
}
}

Call TestServlet and press "Test redirect" under Netscape 4.61 (try this
with IE 4.0 and see the speed difference).

State-Changed-Why:
I'm testing with the latest stuff in CVS and I cannot
 duplicate this problem. My only difference is that I tested
 with Netscape 4.5 and 4.6, not 4.6.1. Here is the site
 running your code:

http://www.working-dogs.com/example/TestServlet

Could you please test it with your copy of Netscape 4.6.1 and
 let me know if it is still an issue? If it works fine for
 you, then I will assume that this bug has already been 
addressed and I will close this bug report by telling you 
to upgrade to the next version when it is released or to 
use the stuff in CVS instead.

thx.
