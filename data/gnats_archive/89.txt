>Release:        1.2b4
>Environment:
SunOS 5.6, gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
SunOS 5.6 has a getcwd prototype in unistd.h.  The macro from conf.h
causes the prototype to expand into garbage and the build fails:

gcc -c -Iregex  -O3 -mv8 -DSOLARIS2 -DSTATUS -DICMD  alloc.c
In file included from conf.h:519,
                 from alloc.c:61:
/pkg/gnu/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.6/2.7.2.1/include/unistd.h:280: parse error before `MAX_STRING_LEN'
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `alloc.o'
>How-To-Repeat:
Build on SunOS 5.6
>Fix:
Use guards such as HAVE_GETCWD instead of guards like SOLARIS to determine
whether or not workarounds/features need to be used
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Fri Feb 21 12:48:03 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed by getting rid of the getwd() macro entirely.  The
fixed version will be available in 1.2b7 when released
in a few days.
