State-Changed-Why:
You don't say what version of Apache you are using.
However, since you mention 1.0.3 I suspect that you
are using something horribly outdated.  It is stated
quite clearly that you should try the lastest version
(1.2.1) before reporting a bug.

 Do you have the latest SCO tcp/ip patches applied to your system?  I'm
 pretty sure that stock 5.0.0 is not good enough to run apache.
