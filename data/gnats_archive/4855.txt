>Environment:
Win32 (NT4), Sun JDK 1.2.1
>Description:
After shutting down the Apache server (either CTRL-C or 'apache -k shutdown'), its "java.exe" process is left running.  This can be seen as an ~8MB process in the Windows Task Manager.  Not a terrible problem yet, but it means that if I change a class (as is frequently the case during SW development), I have to open up the Task Manager and kill the Java process before re-running apache!  EVERY time.  This sucks!  It took me a long time to figure out that was even the problem, but JServ should definitely kill the JVM when it's done.

BTW I checked all through the FAQs, and couldn't find anything on this, so if it has been discussed, please point me to the right place.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description... Contact me if you can't reproduce it, though I can't imagine it's too hard to see.
>Fix:
JServ should force the JVM process to terminate when Apache shuts down.  If this is evil, then at LEAST there should be an option for this to happen.  There are normally 6 or so Java.exe processes running, and for me to pick one at random to terminate isn't the best solution right now.

 It is in the fAQ...

 apache -k shutdown is the only proper way to do it and it definately kills
 the JVM.

 Does this happen also when you run Apache and JServ from the Service
 Manager Panel in Windows NT Control Panel? I'm running NT4 either, and I
 never had this problem.
 What does your Apache error log say? Does it report that it cannot kill
 the JVM?

Cool... We'll close the bug report :-)
