>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
HPUX 11.0 - With patches  sachant que le module
	externe est un module C++ compile avec le compilateur aCC 3.25
>Description:
The initial problem appears when we try to start the httpd server linked in DSO mode , this one tries to load (shl_load) a library C++ tha was compiled with aCC  we got the message :

/usr/lib/dld.sl: Can't shl_load() a library containing Thread Local Storage: /usr/lib/libcl.2
	/usr/lib/dld.sl: Exec format error.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Patch PHSS-23699 is compulsory and in addition the following modification has to be done in the sources :

1- In src/main/http_main.c,  in the function REALMAIN, before any other code add the 

       following lines :

                #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10) || defined(HPUX11)

                        (void *)_main(); // initialization of the runtime C++

                #endif

     2- In src/os/unix/os.c, in the function ap_os_dso_load change the  following line :

                        handle = shl_load(path, BIND_IMMEDIATE|BIND_VERBOSE|BIND_NOSTART, 0L);

                by 

                        handle = shl_load(path, BIND_IMMEDIATE|BIND_VERBOSE, 0L);
