Linux 2.2.1 i586, gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
When multiple servlet init parameters are specified using "initArgs",
e.g. servlet.myserlvet.initArgs=firstOne=value1,secondOne=value2,
JServ reports that: ", has no value", or something to that effect. Specifying
multiple parameters for all servlets works OK,
e.g. servlets.default.initArgs=firstOne=value1,secondOne=value2 works and
both parameters are recognized.
