>Description:
I made a servlet printing a message.The servlet was on local filesystem.
After I changed a message in servlet,I tried to run it.But its message didn't change.
I checked servlet tracing message,and I found a message "cl#0 Loaded class GetPut from system"."GetPut" is my servlet name.I recongnized you understood servlets on local filesystem were system classes and system classes were not autoreloaded by servlet loader.
I want to ask you this phenomenon is a specification or not.
>How-To-Repeat:
following steps.
1.Make a simple servlet.Then instal it to apache.
2.Run it by WWW client.
3.Change this serverlet.For example ,chage a message in this servlet.
4.Rerun it by WW client.But not reloading WWW server.
>Fix:
It is too difficult for me.

 i'm not sure if it is a specification (ie: as part of the JSDK), but it is
 the intended effect of Apache JServ because of the fact that it implements
 its own classloader. this allows Apache JServ to provide some level of
 "abstraction" so that servlet zones can be implemented and servlets can be
 protected from one another with the use of zones.
