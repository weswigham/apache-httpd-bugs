Windows 98
>Description:
I want to run a database program from an HTML form which then calls a CGI script, which calls a batch file, which calls a database program - CDS/ISIS - 16bit, and the result of the search is returned and displayed.
It works fine under UNIX/Linux with Apache, but not with the Windows version. Internal Server Error.
The error log says: [Sun Jun 06 22:39:55 1999] [info] removed PID file c:/program files/apache group/apache/logs/httpd.pid (pid=-3801719) [Sun Jun 06 22:57:38 1999] [error] [client 192.168.2.1] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: c:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/isfrag.pl.
I then had a look at Apache's Website and found bug reports at PR 2707, 2836, 2494, and downloaded the 'apache-mhz' from ftp://ftp.mhs.ch/pub, but the error message now is that Apache 1.3.1. is not in the Windows registry. 
Is there any solution to this problem in the latest version (1.3.6) of Apache for Windows. Renate Morgenstern

State-Changed-Why:
I intuit that you are running 1.3.1? True? If so, then I
think 1.3.6 will fix the problem.  Apache for Win32 1.3.1
had problems with spaces in path names. Upgrade and post
the results here.

Make sure to shutdown Apache before installing the new version.

 Looks very much like PR#4628 - you called _16-bit_ application and got ex=
 actly
 the same error message as it was there. PR#4628 is for 1.3.6, so problem =
 still
 exist and probably not related to spaces in the path (in PR#4628 there we=
 re no
 spaces, program was called test.exe).
