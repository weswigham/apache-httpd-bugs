>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP3, Windows 95 OSR2
Using 1.3b6 Binary release
>Description:
Project 98 comes with a web interface for task updating, which seems to
be a Visual Basic .EXE.  It works very well under Win95 with the Microsoft
Personal Web Server but fails when Apache is the server.  

The web interface is accessed through "http://<server>/project/mspjhttp.exe".
After pressing the "GO" button on the login screen, I get the following 
message:

Not Found

The requested URL /project//program was not found on this server.

Looking at the html source for the login screen, the POST URL is as follows:

<form method=post action="\program files/apache group/apache/htdocs/project/mspjhttp.exe?">

while with the Personal Web Server the login procedure is completed with the
correct URL, i.e. "/project/mspjhttp.exe?"
>How-To-Repeat:
You need MS Project 98 and the 1.3b6 binary installation.
>Fix:
No.  Microsoft reports that their CGI program works with O'Reilly Website,
Netscape FastTrack and Entreprise servers.

State-Changed-Why:
Without source to the ms project CGI it is difficult for
us to tell what environment variables are being used to
construct the URL for the form submission.  Any ideas?
Could you run the equivalent of "printenv.cgi" under
each of those servers to see if you could tell us what we
do differently in the CGI environment?

Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:

This may well be due to the space character, or the
initial '\', in the path to your DocumentRoot and/or
ServerRoot.  Try installing Apache 1.3.2 into a path
that doesn't include these characters.
