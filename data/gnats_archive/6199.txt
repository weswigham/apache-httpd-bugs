apache
>Environment:
SuSE Linux 6.3 (i386) on a 486 DX 33MHz. Kernel 2.2.13 (from SuSE)
>Description:
When doing a server "reload", the logfile (syslog) indicates that the
server processes get a SIGHUP, another SIGHUP, a SIGTERM after 3s, and
a SIGKILL after 6 seconds. On my system I get the "SIGHUP received.
Attempting to restart" AFTER all the complaints that some processes
did not exit. So there either is a bad race condition, or the timeouts
are much too short (e.g. if a process is swapped out).
>How-To-Repeat:
I did "rcapache reload" which effectively sends a SIGHUP to the main
process. (I can provide httpd.error_log via EMail if requested)
