State-Changed-When: Wed May 20 04:21:35 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Need more details here.  Solaris is a very well supported
platform, though the developers don't use Sun's own compilers.
Is this a fatal error?  What are the other lines causing this?

Also, see http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/1646 as that 
could also be a cause of some failures.  

Thanks.
