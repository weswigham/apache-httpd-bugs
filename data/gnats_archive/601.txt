>Description:
Log entries show transactions with a request "-" that recieves a
return code of 200:

ouppp213.modems.ou.edu unknown - [20/May/1997:18:16:32 -0500] "-" 200 -
>How-To-Repeat:
I have been unable to reproduce the problem as an erroneous request
should produce a code 400.  For example, telneting directly to the
server and entering a dash produces:

cindy.cs.ou.edu sbnoble - [21/May/1997:10:54:22 -0500] "-" 400 -

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sat May 24 17:25:40 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This happens when a client opens a connection but does not 
make a request before the timeout expires.  There are
several different behaviors that are arguably acceptable
in this case, including not logging anything; we will 
consider the best solution.

State-Changed-When: Wed May 28 20:47:25 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:

We have changed the code to log 408 (Request Time Out) if
the request is not received before the server Timeout.

Thanks for using Apache,
