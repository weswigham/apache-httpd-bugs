WinNT without C complier
>Description:
The first error after I ran this command is :
httpd: cannot determine local host name. User ServerName to set it manually.
So I add my PC IP address as ServerName entry in httpd.conf and rerun this command. Then got the above error.

In logs directory, access_log and error_log are created, but no httpd.pid file.
>How-To-Repeat:
d:\Apache > apache -i

>Fix:
I did try to do the same thing when I login as administrator in my PC.
Then I got the error:
Too many arguments in command line

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid I don't understand exactly what you did, in
what order, and what result you got from each step.

Did "apache -i" work?  What happened when you tried it?

After that, did you have an Apache entry in the services
control panel?  If so, what happens when you try starting
it?

What happens if you try running Apache from the command
line (ie. no arguments)?  It should just start up and 
remain control of the shell while starting to serve
requests.
