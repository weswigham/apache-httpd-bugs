>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP3 with hotfixes
Apache compiled with MSVC++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
I do not seem to be able to restrict access to the proxy module using the <Directory> directive.  I have the following access.conf:

<Directory />
Order Deny,Allow     
Deny from All
Options None
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

<Directory proxy:*>
order deny,allow
deny from All
Options None
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.

<Directory "C:/Apache/htdocs/">

# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".

# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you (or at least, not yet).

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
# override. Can also be "All", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo", 
# "AuthConfig", and "Limit"

AllowOverride None

#Controls who can get stuff from this server.

order deny,allow
allow from *
</Directory>

# /apache/cgi-bin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.

<Directory /apache/cgi-bin>
AllowOverride None
Options None
</Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
Try these settings:

<Directory proxy:*>
order deny,allow
deny from All
Options None
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

I'm perfectly willing to accept I've screwed up in some way, but can't figure out how.

Sorry, no.

 Did you try doing as the docs say, and use "deny from all"?

 Yes, sorry about that.  The behaviour is still the same though.
