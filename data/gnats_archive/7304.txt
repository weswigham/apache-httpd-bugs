>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
All/Any
>Description:
According to the CGI 1.1 specification, the server should parse the following 3 server headers,

Content-type:
Location:
Status:

Status apears not to be parsed in the correct manor.
If the cgi sends a printf("Status: 404 Not Found\n\n");
the server should treat it as a 404, and call the ErrorDocument 404 handler.
This however does not happen.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the following C source:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

  printf("Status: 404 Not Found\n\n");
  exit(1);
};

compile and place in a "cgi directory"

telnet server port
GET /cgi-bin/test HTTP/1.0

you will see a 0 lengthe document with a Content-type: plain/html

 The problem reported over a year ago still exists,
 
 here is a working patch against 1.3.23

         if (!r->header_only) {
             ap_send_fb(script_in, r);

             return REDIRECT;
         }
 !         else if ( r->status != 200 )
 !         {
 !           return r->status;
 !         }
         ap_send_http_header(r);
         if (!r->header_only) {
             ap_send_fb(script_in, r);

 I'm not sure if this ends up being the best way to handel this however it
 does work for me.
