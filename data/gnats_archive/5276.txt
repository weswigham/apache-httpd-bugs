Building JServ-1.1p3
>Description:
I tried to build my distribution using --with-JSDK, as advised in the upgrade notes.
However, the option that I pass there is ignored completely; the configure
script still looks in /usr/local/JSDK2.0 and I cannot pass a new value in.
>How-To-Repeat:
1) Do not have a /usr/local/JSDK2.0 directory, but move it to another path (mine is /usr/lib/java/jsdk/2.0/)
2) ./configure with the JServ-1.1p3 files
>Fix:
I don't know enough about the configure scripts to help :-/
