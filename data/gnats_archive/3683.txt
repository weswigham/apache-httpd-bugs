State-Changed-Why:

Unfortunately, that field is free-format rather than a
set of specific values.  Adding the ability to filter PRs
with a specific value would certainly result in some
being missed, and having it matchable by regular expression
is far from easy.  You should be able to use an RE
in the search field with 'Header text' selected (e.g.,
"1\.3\.6").  Thanks for the suggestion, though.
