>Description:
I compiled apache with the db_auth_module added in, and I didn't include the 
dbm_auth_module.  I have the Berkeley DB 1.85 installed, and when I went to use
dbmmanage, it created a dbm that was not exactly what apache was looking for.



>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
If you do this:
use DB_File;
dbmopen(%DB, $file, 0664) || die "Error: $!\n";

then...  it will use Berkeley DB (not sure if I spelled that right) instead.
I've ran into that same problem using dbmopen under perl before.  So....
to fix this...  maybe a comment could be added to the script just before the
dbmopen is called so people that run into this problem can fix it quickly.

## db_auth and dbm_auth work with Berkeley DB files - make sure there
## is support for DBM files on your system.  You may need to grab the GNU
## "gdbm" package if not and possibly adjust EXTRA_LIBS. (This may be
## done by Configure at a later date)

If I read that correctly, then you can also use gdbm to do the db
authentication.  I'm reaching here but maybe if you define gdbm when you're
building apache, then it puts use GDBM_File instead of use DB_File inside the
dbmmanage script.  Or it puts use DB_File and then commented next to it the
text says
#use GDBM_File; #uncomment this and comment use DB_File if you compiled with
                #GDBM
Just a suggestion to make things a little easier.  Hope this helps.

State-Changed-Why:
This is because dbmmanage is meant to manage dbm files,
there is no tool in the 1.2.4 distribution to manage db
files.  You can build dbmmanage in a way that it will
work on db files.  Or you could get the new perl-based
dbmmanage that comes with Apache 1.3b2 in src/support
and will work just fine against 1.2.4.
