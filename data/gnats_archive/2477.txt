>Description:
When using the FollowSymLinks directive in virtual host setups you get an access denied message when trying to connect to the virtual host. Putting the hard path in the virtual host setup solves the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a sym link (ln -s) to a home dir for a virtual host and use this path for the Virtual host setup path's.

State-Changed-Why:
This is likely because your access.conf file is missing the
Options FollowSymLink in the <Directory /> section.  This was
an oversight in the distributed .conf files with 1.3.0 and is
fixed in 1.3.1.  It's pretty easy to fix in your files though.

 Actually I have the FollowSymLinks in both the access.conf files and in the
 virtual host area in my httpd.conf file. Double duty and it still doesn't
 work.

 FollowSymLinks is a per-directory configuration setting.  If you have any
 <Directory> containers and they have any Options settings which don't
 include FollowSymLinks then you've disabled symlinks.

 Can someone else take over?  I'm tired of trying to explain to people that
 their entire config is relevant.

 Dean,
    Here is my config, which is virtually identical to my 1.26 config with
 the exception that the paths are now hard...
 
 <VirtualHost test.whtech.com>
 ServerAdmin webmaster@whtech.com
 DocumentRoot /usr/home/whtech/html
 ServerName test.whtech.com
 ErrorLog /usr/local/etc/apache/var/log/wht.error_log
 <Directory /usr/home/whtech/html>
 Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
 AllowOverride All
 order allow,deny
 allow from all
 </Directory>
 <Location /server-status>
 SetHandler server-status
 Order deny,allow
 allow from all
 </Location>
 </VirtualHost>
 
 You can see that I have a <Directory> diretive, and that the option is set.
