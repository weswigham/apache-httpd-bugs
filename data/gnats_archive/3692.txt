>Description:
(Note: This may just be a rephrasing of PR 3001 - I'm not smart enough to see
through that. If it is indeed the case, you're welcome to flame me...)

On Win95, I have set up Apache w/ DocumentRoot "X:" When accessing 
DocumentRoot through the script (PHP), it is reported as "x:/" 
(with the trailing slash). 

On the RapidSite setup, no trailing slash is reported in DocumentRoot (again, 
using PHP). I don't know the contents of the RapidSite .conf files

According to the PHP people, PHP never touches the DocumentRoot before passing
it on to the script.

The problem: As the Win32 version insists on adding the trailing slash, it's
hard to move documets w/ code across platforms.
>How-To-Repeat:
Using PHP and the Win95 setup defined above, create a one-line document 
containing "<? phpinfo() ?>"
>Fix:
Having/not having a trailing slash in DocumentRoot should be consistent
across platforms.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid I don't understand why it is such a problem to
have to deal with the possibility of a trailing slash or not.

On Unix, if you put a trailing / in the config file then
there will be one.  If you don't, you don't.  If you are
referring to the root of a filesystem, there will always
be a trailing '/' since there will be at least one '/'.

On Windows, the same thing holds; the only difference is
that in the special case of "x:" a trailing '/' is added.
You can not rely on the presence or absense of one, since it
can vary depending on how it is configured.
