>Description:
Since update from 2.0.28 to 2.0.32 following message occurs in log:

unable to compile pattern "^[0"

perhaps caused by SSI string:
/^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}$/
(Match an IPv4 address)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try yourself in an SSI page
>Fix:
No, but looks like SSI is broken, like mentioned in an e-mail, SSI on "/" don't work and also not on Multiview pages...
...2.0.28 worked fine.

 I don't know much about SSI documents but I do know how to debug.
 It would save me a lot of time if you could send me a small SSI
 document which uses your regular expression and which exhibits the
 problem.  Please copy apbugs.apache.org so that the information is
 available to other people in the event that I am unable to work on the
 problem.
 
 Thanks!

 Attached you'll find the shtml doc containing some SSI regex. Working
 fine on beta28, causing trouble in beta32

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Wed Mar 13 12:48:20 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
This problem has been fixed and will be in the next release
of Apache 2.0.

Here is the patch that fixes the problem:

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/filters/mod_include.c.diff?r1=1.196&r2=1.197

There have been a number of changes to mod_include since
2.0.32.  I don't know how difficult it would be to apply
the patch to 2.0.32.  

Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache 2.0!
