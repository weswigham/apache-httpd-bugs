>Description:
My server, 24.3.6.108, in addition to the main server page, should have 2 virtual hosts.

When accessing adrok.dustball.com OR www.cbwest.com (the two vhosts) it always shows the main server page. 

Try http://www.cbwest.com or http://adrok.dustball.com -- they show the same as http://24.3.6.108

Thanks,
Jerry

 You are aware that, as documented, having a NameVirtualHost will not allow
 anyone to access the "main" server on that IP, correct?

 Are you sure you are modifying the right copy of the config files?  If you
 try adding some garbage that should make Apache fail and restarting
 Apache, does it complain?  If not, you are probably modifying the wrong
 config file.
 
 What output does "httpd -S" give?  Is there anything related in the error
 log?

 Hi, thank you for the quick response.  Your time is appreciated greatly!
 
 >You are aware that, as documented, having a NameVirtualHost will not allow
 >anyone to access the "main" server on that IP, correct?
 
 Yes, that is the documented behavior.  That is what I want.
 
 >Are you sure you are modifying the right copy of the config files?
 Yes.  I only have one httpd-conf on the system.
 
 >If you try adding some garbage that should make Apache fail and restarting

 Apache fails when garbage is inserted as described.  It's the right file.
 
 >What output does "httpd -S" give?
 VirtualHost configuration:
 24.3.6.108:80          is a NameVirtualHost
                        default server www.cbwest.com
 (/usr/local/etc/apache/httpd.conf:78)
                        port 80 namevhost www.cbwest.com
 (/usr/local/etc/apache/httpd.conf:78)
                        port 80 namevhost adrok.dustball.com
 (/usr/local/etc/apache/httpd.conf:87)
 
 >Is there anything related in the error log?
 Nope, just the startup notice.
 
 Thanks,
 Jerry

I noticed that each Vhost has it's own accesslog. Do requests
for each server show up in the "right" access log?
