All
>Description:
The fact that AuthName requires quotes for a multiple word auth-domain is
documented only in "upgrading to 1.3". This also should be in the AuthName
section of the "Core Features" page. Additionally, the example in the FAQ is
broken.
>How-To-Repeat:
Actually try the example in the FAQ.

>Fix:
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#authname
Syntax: AuthName auth-domain | "auth domain"

http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#remote-auth-only
AuthName "special directory"
