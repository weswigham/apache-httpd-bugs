>Description:
The VirtHost directive does not respond properly when a name given in the virtual
host field resolves out to more than one IP address.  For the second or more IP,
it will use the default setting instead of the VirtualHost settings.  This is bad
for environments where for redundancy or other reasons, each virtual host has
more than one IP address.  I demonstrated it with the IP address both being on
the same server, and the server only handled the first IP properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
put more than one A record for a domain in the DNS and then force it to use both.
A recent version of Lynx makes this easy to demonstrate--to to the referenced
URL with Lynx, exit, then do it again.  The second time it should show up as
the default for the server or that IP.
>Fix:
For each virthost, allow more than one Ip address to be handled

 This sounds like a local configuration problem, Apache does respond to all
 addresses for each domain name used, at least it does for me. 
 
 One guess is that you have the hostname in /etc/hosts and you're receiving
 the /etc/hosts response rather than the DNS response -- and /etc/hosts
 responses only return a single address. 
 
 The next guess is that the DNS name you're using has one address which
 matches the global ServerName, and another address which doesn't. 
 Addresses matching the global ServerName (i.e. overlapping ip addresses) 
 are treated quite differently. 
 
 You should also read the file htdocs/manual/dns-caveats.html since it
 explains why you probably don't want to use DNS names in <VirtualHost>
 statements, especially if reliability is an issue. 
 
 BTW, linux 1.2.30 doesn't exist ... do you mean 2.0.30?

 Checked that, only one name is in the hosts (asside from localhost) and
 that is different than the names I'm using in the virtualhost directive.
 Good idea to check though.

 The global servername is www.the-link.net with an IP address of
 209.12.240.129.  The virtual hosts are on various names, all of which
 resolve out to 209.12.240.131 and 206.25.198.4.  The server's primary IP
 address is 206.25.198.4.  Any ideas with this config?

 The DNS servers are on the same local network and are backed up, and I
 have control of all the domains I host for DNS...

 yep, my mistake.  :)  Work with too many OS's and revisions...

 Thanks for the help on this, but I don't think we've hit it yet...

 When you say the server's primary IP address is 206.25.198.4 do you mean
 that the ip address of the result of the 'hostname' command is
 206.25.198.4? 
 
 And also just to be sure we're speaking the same terminology here, when I
 asked about the "global servername" I was referring to any ServerName
 directive appearing outside all VirtualHost directives.  The situation
 you're describing is exactly what would happen if you had no global
 ServerName directive.
 
 How about sending me your config files?

 when I type hostname, I get shell.the-link.net which is 206.25.198.4 when
 resolved (and 206.25.198.4 resolves back to shell.the-link.net).

 The primary ServerName directive is vhost.the-link.net which has the same
 IP's as what the virtual hosts are using.  Might this be the problem?

 here is the http.conf file, I'll send the others if you need them, but I
 doubt they would be of any use in this situation.  I changed
 vhost.the-link.net to map to one IP for the moment, but it was two...

 Yup this is the problem.  Call it non-intuitive (I'll agree with you), but
 the global ServerName dictates what ip addresses will be considered for
 HTTP/1.1 Host: based vhosting... which is almost never what anyone wants. 
 The standard workaround is this: 
 
 # disable the global server
 ServerName localhost
 
 # define a vhost to match any otherwise unspecified ip address
 <VirtualHost _default_>
 ServerName whatever
 ...
 </VirtualHost>

 This doesn't quite make sense--the global ServerName directive was
 pointing to BOTH IP's that I wanted, not just one.  The virtual hosts that
 I had a problem with were on the same IP's (I used the same dns .hosts
 file for vhost and every other domain to insure consistancy).  It seems
 like it chose to respond to HTTP 1.1 requests only on one of the two IP's
 that were specified in the global servername directive, which I would say
 is wrong, even given the limitations described.

 Oh you and I are talking about completely different things. 
 
 You're trying to give name-based (i.e. HTTP/1.1) vhosts multiple IP
 addresses right?  Well, that just isn't possible.  A vhost is either
 name-based (which works on exactly those ip addresses matching the global
 ServerName, i.e. 209.12.240.131) or ip-based, it can't be both.
 
 Your global ServerName has exactly one ip address, so all your name based
 hosts must also have exactly one ip address.
 
 Have you read htdocs/manual/vhosts-in-depth.html ?

 But the name based vhosts had the exact same IP addresses (note plural) as
 the global servername did.  As I had mentioned, the vhost.the-link.net did
 have two IP addresses (changed due to this problem) and the vhosts were
 overlayed on exactly the same IP addresses.  When it had two IP addresses
 for vhost.the-link.net (the global name), it only handled the virtuals on
 one of the IP's not both.

State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sat Oct  4 19:39:45 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Now that I understand the entire problem ... this should work,
but even if it is broken it won't be fixed in 1.2.  The vhost code
has been changed again in 1.3 and it should support this ... maybe
not in 1.3a1, but in 1.3b1 whenever we release it.

Note that if redundancy is your concern there are other ways to
achieve the same thing.  You only need one IP address, unless you're
running two servers -- in that case you could use m4 or perl to
generate two configs for them.  If you want to use just one server
with two network interfaces then I suggest (and I suggest this for
all servers, even with one network interface) that you put all the
vhost ip addresses on the *loopback* interface rather than on
the ethernet interface(s).  If you slap an entire net of addresses
on your loopback then you only need to tell your router where
to find that net ... and if one host should go down then you can
move to another host by changing the route on the router.

In any event, sorry for the hassle.  The vhost code sucks when
it comes to HTTP/1.1-Host based hosts.
