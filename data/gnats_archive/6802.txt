Apache 1.3.14 + mod_rewrite fix diff
>Description:
When using a Condition backreference as a key to a dbm RewriteMap, used in a
RewriteCond statement, the %<n> is not expanded correctly.

This still exists with the mod_rewrite patch fix for 1.3.14
>How-To-Repeat:
Using a DBM rewrite map named foo, here is the httpd.conf lines

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} /[~|%7E]([a-z0-9]*)/$	[NC]
RewriteCond %{foo:%1}	!NO
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$	/someotherurl/$1 [L]

The foo map lookup fails since %1 is passed as tthe key instead of the 
value of the conditional backreference

 Er, but the syntax for a map lookup is ${map:key} not %{}.

 Sorry for the dup, missed the apbugs cc.
 
 That was a typo, in my copying of the test.  It should be:
 
 RewriteCond ${foo:%1}	!NO
 
 The problem does exist with proper syntax (I lacked cut'n'paste).
