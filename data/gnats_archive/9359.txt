>Description:
I have apache 1.3.22 installed on windows 2000 server, my httpd.conf look like this: 

<VirtualHost 198.7.130.163:200>
Options +Includes
AddType text/html .inc
AddHandler server-parsed .inc
DocumentRoot "C:/wwwroot/httproot"

Alias /html/site/ "c:/wwwroot/httproot/html/development/test_site1/"
Alias /html/common/ "C:/wwwroot/httproot/html/development/common/"
Alias /server/ "C:/wwwroot/httproot/development_server/"

ScriptAlias /SCRIPTS/ "C:/wwwroot/scipts/"

<IfModule mod_dir.c>
DirectoryIndex default.asp default.htm index.htm index.html
</IfModule>

</VirtualHost>

And in my default.asp:

<% @enablesessionstate=false %> 
<% option explicit %>
<% response.buffer=true %> 
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN'>
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<BASEFONT SIZE='3'>
<!--#INCLUDE virtual="/html/site/1.inc"     -->
<!--#INCLUDE virtual="/html/common/2.inc" -->
.....

When default.asp is executed, it return the error: "Include file not found."

I think that the alias is only work with URL directing but not act like virtual directory.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache doesn't include any support for ASP.  Presumably you are using some third party product to do this, and it is interpreting the includes.  Apache has no control over how it does that.
