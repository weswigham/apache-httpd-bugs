>Description:
In line 139 of the apachectl script the output of lynx is piped thru awk. If awk
exits before it has read lynx's complete output, lynx would get a SIGPIPE.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
replace the line by
( trap '' SIGPIPE
  $LYNX $STATUSURL | awk ' /process$/ { print; exit } { print } '
)

By the way in line 53 you could append >/dev/null 2>&1 to kill -0 $PID.
