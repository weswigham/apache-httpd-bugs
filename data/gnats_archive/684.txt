QNX 4.23A
Watcom C 10.6
>Description:
Makefile generated for support direcrtory is not good for QNX. 

It needs extra LIBS1 definition: LIBS1=-lunix
and $(LIBS) must be added to htdigest target (like it is in htpasswd target).

suEXEC wrapper needs extra include: <sys/types.h>
and fake initgroups() definition (like it is in src directory), bacause QNX does not have it.

Problems like above were solved for src directory, but not for support.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just type:
cd support
make
 :-)
>Fix:
Yes, I have fixed Makefile and suexec.c.
diff -n output available too

State-Changed-Why:
Why does it neeed -lunix?  That isn't included in the src 
directory; what does it choke on if it doesn't have it?

suexec.c already does include sys/types.h and has forever.

Please verify this against 1.2.0 and then send the 
diffs required to make it work for you...

Thanks.

 Because some popular Unix stuff is not in libc in QNX. E.g., a function to
 get password from command line without echo (don't remember its name) is in
 unix.lib.

 Perhaps because the rest of Apache code don't use functions which are not
 in libc in QNX. However, it is not good idea to rely on this luck further.
 Generally, only POSIX functions are in libc in QNX.

 Thas was my err - I just included my stuff above, so compiler complained
 :-(

 Well, I did it - that all (except for sys/types.h) applies to 1.2.0 as
 well.
 You probably aware about another my report - about mmap() support. I
 include appropriate stuff here, FYI. If something is unclear, please ask.
 
 Affected files:
 src/Configure		-- required to generate proper Makefile for support dir.
 src/conf.h			-- mmap definitions for QNX
 src/http_main.c		-- mmap handling for QNX
 support/Makefile.tmpl	-- for htdigest.c
 support/suexec.c		-- for itself

 With above changes applied to fresh 1.2.0 everything complies and works ok
 on QNX 4.23A, using Watcom C 10.6

 Looks like we're safe to use that patch.

 P.S. I doubt apache compiles in 16-bit land... the int/ptr stuff would
 easily mess it up.

 You should be safe unless you make a 16-bit version of Apache. The mmap
 support has been in all the 32-bit versions of QNX (4.2 and later). BTW,
 the compiler atomatically defines the __QNX__ macro, so you could compile
 QNX code based on that if you want.

The support/ changes are in 1.3-dev now.  The mmap changes
