>Description:
I've compiled both apache 1.3.6, and Apache 1.3.9, on my machine, to use PHP-4.0B2 with it. Compiles clean, installs clean. When I run 'apachectl start', I get the following:

[Sun Nov 7  21:17:55 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 (PHP4.0B2) configured -- resuming normal operations

Apache is exiting!
>How-To-Repeat:
recompile apache, witht he same setup, as above. glibc-2.1.2 as the main library, and recompile apache, using libc-5.4.46. Same error occurs, on both. egcs-1.1.2 or probably even gcc-2.7.2.3. Either, should give the same error.

initgroups() in http_main.c, line 3018,

         Yes I have. Not only that, but created new groups on the machine, all 
 with unique ids > 0, < 65534. All failed. Here's an example:

         I don't want to have to set it to be as group users (100), as that 
 could easily cause a huge security hole. I've also tried 60001, which gave me 
 the same error above, s/2000/60001. Any other insights into this?
 
                                                         BL.
