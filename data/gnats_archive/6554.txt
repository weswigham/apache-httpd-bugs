>Description:
Hi,
Well I have configure apache 1.3.12 on roc at port 8310 and it is functional. Now configuring the JServ the servlet engine is creating the problem. Well as per the configuration :
First the apache was configured with out DSO support ( as we dont need to go for CGI/PERL ) the configuration was fine with no errors reported. with make and make install too. And it is showing up perfect at http://roc:8310/.
Well the configuration of JServ is going on fine but the server side scripts r not being executed as per the docs an appropriate entries were made i.e. in httpd.conf file of apache where the jserv.conf file is included, and in jserv.conf the jserv.properties and finally in jserv.properties file  zone.properties was include.
httpd.conf -> jserv.conf -> jserv.properties -> zone.properties.
But when the jsp page is being executed the apache doesn't execute the jsp page and I suppose its not even recognizing the JServ engine. 
Any information on this will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Ravindra
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
