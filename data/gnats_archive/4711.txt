>Release:        Apache 1.3.6 JServ1.0
>Environment:
Linux (Red Hat 6.0), JDK1.1.1, JSDK2.0
>Description:
When you run SnoopServlet that comes with a JSDK 2.0 distribution in examples subdirectory, there is an error in what it shows as requested URL.  It always displays the server domain name regardless of what is typed in the address field of a browser.  For instance, you can access the SnoopServlet by typing the IP address/examples/SnoopServlet and it will behave as you have accessed it by typing the domain name.
>How-To-Repeat:
Access SnoopServlet that is installed on a Linux/Apache 1.3.6 platform by IP address of the server and by the domain name of the server and you will get the same result for the Requested URL which should not happen.
