>Description:
I currently have implemented an nt authentication module for apache since 
I didn't like any of the currently registed modules...
(which I plan to submit to the apache module database when I am happy with it)

I am now attempting to create a ntauth.log file and was wondering where the
correct/appropiate place I should open the log file. I want to avoid
opening/closing the file all the time, and I want/need to make it as easy as
possible to integrate into later versions of apache (I also don't want to
use syslog either...). 

How/when/where should I create/open this file? 
Is there a way to do this without hacking the apache source code (too much)?
[ side note: Where is a good resource to the apache API? so I don't have to 
bug you guys with questions like this! ]

An added datastruct to apache for misc logs to be opened?

State-Changed-Why:
Look at any of the mod_log* moduels for examples.  You open
it in the init stage, there are a few API functions you
can use for various parts of it for consistency, etc.  It
shouldn't be difficult to figure out from the existing logging
modules.

The  biggest difference is that you probably don't want to
log to it from the logging stage, but when you are called
to do authentication.

There isn't really any great documentation on this sort of
stuff right now, unfortunately.

 Marc,
   I've already looked at that part of the code, but before I start hacking
 the apache code, I was wondering if there was an API to open a logfile and
 to get a file descriptor prior to when httpd is forked.
 
   The main reason I want to do this is so that when apache 1.x comes out, I
 can simply cp ~nt_auth/src/*.[ch] to ~apache/src/modules/extra
 make some changes in ~apache/src/modules/extra/Makefile compile and go.
 
 I want to avoid going into ~apache/src/main/http_main.c to get the logging
 capability I need.
   
    Since this web server will be authenticating all of the time, I want to
 minimize the overhead of opening and closing the log file (such as when
 apache changes stderr to be logs/error_log file -> which I am using for
 now).
 
   I also plan to only log when it authenticates as well...
 
 Please tell me there is a way around hacking apache... It will make my
 install script a lot more difficult with a lot of assumptions
 (ass-u-me-tions)!!!!
 
   Thanks in advance,
 	-Henry

 Again, look at mod_log_*.

 mod_log_* does not do anything in http_main.c.  It only uses API calls.
 While there isn't a fully API to just open a logfile, it is only a dozen
 lines or so of code.
 
 All logging except from error logging is done completely by modules right
 now.
