>Description:
Sorry for the bug report here, but I'm out of options.

We are running WebObjects (a big cgi program).  When a form on a secure page
is posted from a Netscape 3.03 client, the connection hangs.  The server does not
indicate that the request was received.  The client CPU usage goes to 100% and stays
there until a stop is sent to the browser.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid that there's nothing we can do with or about
this; the SSL stuff is an add-on with which we have
nothing to do.  Please contact your vendor.
