>Description:
I have a cgi program to allow access to protected directories. This program uses the "Crypt" method of creating encrypted passwords. I have modified the script to format for MD5, SH1 and Digest.

My problem is, that no matter what I formatt the encryption in, I keep getting a password mismatch error. No matter how I create a passowrd from the "htpasswd" command that came with Apache 1.3.9, it always defaults to the MD5 for use with windows even when I use the -d command. This produces "test:$apr1$vD/.....$n1PLMtYoBuqq0xX0NwOsg." When writing in MD5 format from a cgi script, I get something like this "test:kjwehrbnskdfsdfkhsd" or a binary code.

Either way, unless I use the htpasswd command that came with Apache, I cannot protect my "Client" directory or at least allow access.

Can I disable this somehow. I have looked all over the documentation to find an answer but cannot.

Please help.

Thanks,
Natalie

State-Changed-Why:
That is designed and expected behaviour.  Apache does not
include the crypt() routine on Windows due to export
control issues, so it cannot interpret passwords that
have been encrypted by another tool using that algorithm.
The MD5 algorithm was chosen as the standard for Apache
because it will work on all platforms on which Apache is
supported.
