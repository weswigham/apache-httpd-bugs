>Description:
After updating to version 1.3.9, my directory listings no longer display the Header.html and Readme.html files. These directories had displayed properly in listings generated under Apache 1.3.6.

The ReadmeName and HeaderName directives appear now as they had in my previous config files:

ReadmeName README
HeaderName HEADER

The corresponding Readme.html and Header.html files are in their same locations within the indexed directories as before and have not changed.

State-Changed-Why:
Check the arguments to the IndexIgnore config directive. 
By default, it is set to ignore README* and HEADER* which
will match the files in /icons/. Furthermore, Win32 is case
preserving/aware but case insensitive. I.e., Header.html is 
the same as HeAdEr.HtMl. 

I suspect the code was not working correctly for Win32 
Apache pre-1.3.9 and it is working correctly now.

 Thanks for the quick response.
 
 Perhaps you misunderstood. The files Readme.html and Header.html do not
 appear in the generated listing as files. This is correct behavior, as the
 IndexIgnore directive instructs the server to ignore the presence of these
 files when generating the listing. The problem is that the contents of
 Header.html no longer appears at the top of the page, nor the Readme.html
 file at the bottom, as it properly did in the Win32 1.3.6 version. All I get
 is a list of files with the Header.html and Readme.html having no effect on
 the formatting of the page at all. Only the relative path text is at the top
 of the page where the contents of Header.html should be and at the bottom is
 the server and port number instead of the Readme.html. This is the proper
 behavior only if no Header or Readme directive is specified, which is not
 the case here. These files should be detected by the server and incorporated
 into their respective parts of the formatted directory, listing the contents
 of the directory as the body of the page.
 
 Thanks again.
 Ron Brown

Comment-Added:
Yes, I did misunderstand because this function works fine 
for me. I have the (dis?)advantage of not knowing how it worked prior to 1.3.9 :-)

Apache 1.3.9 requires that the arguments to ReadmeName and
HeaderName contain an extension recognized by the server,
e.g., Readme.html. Furthermore, the real file's name must 
exactly match the file name specified in the config 
directive. This is a change from pre 1.3.9 behaviour where
the server would intuit the .html extension.  You may be  
able to enable multiviews in the directory to recover the 
previous behaviour.

 I've been waiting to see if there was a response on 
 comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix for this problem before I sent it in as a 
 bug -- I'm glad someone else already did.

 I found that in pre-1.3.9, having "HeaderName HEADER" would cause the file 
 "HEADER" to be used.  Now in 1.3.9, that doesn't work.  The comments in the 
 httpd.conf file says that Apache should be checking for HEADER.txt and 
 HEADER.html, which also doesn't work.

 That kind of sucks -- it means that you are limited to either text or HTML, 
 but the server won't automagically pick the right one for you.

 multiviews doesn't do anything for this, at least with my config.
 
 I did change the "HeaderLine" option to be "HEADER.txt", and renamed the file 
 from HEADER to HEADER.txt, and now it works fine BTW.
