State-Changed-Why:
It sounds as though you mean that you have .htaccess files
that specify authentication information, but when you try
to access the pages, no authentication window appears.  If
that is the case, you probably need to add or modify an
AllowOverride directive to the server configuration files
for the directory in question or one of its ancestors.  The
AllowOverride directive options should include "AuthConfig"
to allow .htaccess files to specify authentication instructions.
See the comments in the conf/access.conf file and the
directives at http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html
Please let us know if this fixes your problem or not.

State-Changed-Why:
No feedback, assuming user is missing the necessary directives
in their .htaccess file to enable the .htpasswd file.  Ken's
response indicates how to do that.
