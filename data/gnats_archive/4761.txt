installed the rpm from the redhat release 6.0
running the server with all non IP virtual hosts

>Description:
Hi,
        I have a site http://www.science-discover.net and this site is now
being syn attacked which is stopping the apache server only ftp and telnet
ssh work fine.
        I get no error messages or access messages from the server. When I
start up the server it will not send any pages. If I change the IP address
to a new one then all works fine.
        I have used a program called tcpdump on linux to find the www
requests coming in from non existent sites and IP address some of the log
is below. I have checked every where for this problem and no one seems to
have reported it.
apache setup to do non IP vertual hosts. The server worked fine for all
virtual sites up to the point that theses messages started coming in.

some of the tcpdump logs showing what is going on.

This causes apache not to send out any pages for the server.
any help you can give on this would be appreciated.

the server says all processes are up and running when I do a ps aux
it shows all 10 runing and one is owned by root all the rest are owned by nobody

State-Changed-Why:
This is not an Apache problem and there isn't too much Apache
can do about it.  By default, the Linux kernel handles SYN
floods _very_ poorly.  You need to make some changes to your
kernel, such as enabling SYN cookies.
