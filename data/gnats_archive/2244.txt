Output from make command:

 ...
 In file included from buff.c:66:
 /usr/include/sys/uio.h:34: conflicting types for `readv'
 /usr/ppco/GNU/lib/gcc-lib/mips-sgi-irix5.3/2.7.2.2.f.2/include/unistd.h:157: previous declaration of `readv'

Looks like another cc vs. gcc difference.

Adding #define NO_WRITEV in the IRIX section of conf.h fixes the problem for us.

User is using gcc compiled against irix 5.3 on an irix 6.2
machine.  That is a broken configuration.

 This should be put in the FAQ so many people run into it.

 IRIX version 6.2, gcc built against 5.3.  This is wrong.  gcc is
 intimately tied with the version of the operating system it is built for. 
 Rebuild gcc on 6.2 and the problem will go away. 
 
 You don't want to run with NO_WRITEV -- it can cause painful network
 traffic against HTTP/1.1 clients (IE4 for example).
