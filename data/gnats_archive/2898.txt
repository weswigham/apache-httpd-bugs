all systems
>Description:
The AuthName syntax changed around 1.3b3 so that
	AuthName foo bar
no longer works; you have to add quotes instead, like
	AuthName "foo bar"

Unfortunately, we at Demon have been using the former syntax fairly extensively,
both internally and in customer documentation. This is making switching to
Apache 1.3 rather more painful :-(
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I suggest that the code be changed to accept either syntax. This would
also fix the original problem that caused the syntax change -- see bug
#1195

State-Changed-Why:

The change was made to move toward uniformity with HTTP and
the rest of the configuration language.  Re-introducing the
original issue plus adding some ambiguity isn't really
desirable.  It should be fairly easy to write a script that
will change occurrences of the old syntax to the new,
such as 's:AuthName(\s+)([^"].+):AuthName$1"$2":i'.
