SunOS suzuka 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
>Description:

We use (httpd.conf)

    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault A2592000

However, this means that Expiration-fields in the headers are added,
even when (conflicting) Expiration-fields are already part of the response.
Our servlet adds some. This is an example of the result:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 29 Apr 2000 09:35:11 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.11 (Unix) ApacheJServ/1.0
Cache-Control: no-cache
Expires: 0
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: max-age=2592000
Expires: Mon, 29 May 2000 09:35:11 GMT
Content-Length: 323
Last-Modified: Sat, 29 Apr 2000 09:35:15 GMT
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Check existing header-fields in responses.
