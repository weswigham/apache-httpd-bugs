>Description:
With b10 my fastcgi processes eventually die and do not restart. 
Once they have all died, the "[an error occurred...]" message appears..
We use a lot of SSIs that call fastcgi scripts. For reason, after time, they 
eventually die off and none restart... There was only a trivial change
needed to get mod_fastcgi.c to compile with Apache b10, the removal of a 
typedef or declaration. There are also a lot of these now:

[Sat May  3 20:52:42 1997] access to /export/home/djh/htdocs/adverts/ad.fcg failed for 198.142.9.14, reason: mod_fastcgi: Unterminated CGI response headers, 0 bytes received from app

Although I don't see how my app would be returning nothing on and off now...
>How-To-Repeat:
I can repeat it by running the fastcgi scripts with b10.

State-Changed-Why:
What was the last version that fastcgi worked with?  Have you
asked folks on the fastcgi mailing list?  It'd be a lot easier for
someone more familiar with fastcgi internals to diagnose this...

  I followed this up mentioning it wasn't Apache's fault. That was quite a
 while ago. You can delete the bug report. ;)
 
   There was a problem with FastCGI that it wasn't configuring itself
 properly, to lock/unlock around accept(), as well as an accept() that was
 never locked. Multiple accept()'s on Solaris == dead fastcgi manager
 process. We've corrected both errors (and a 3rd these fixes revealed), and
 sent them into the FCGI team for inclusion in future versions.
