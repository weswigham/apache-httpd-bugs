>Description:
When defining a customlog tag for use (on a global server or virtualhost)
if you forget to define that tag, logs will be filled with the name of the tag
and no warning is reported.
>How-To-Repeat:
change CustomLog on default httpd.conf for one like this

#LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" user \
"%{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN}x\""  combinedSSL
(note the '#' on the line above)
CustomLog /path/to/access_log combinedSSL

restart apache and do some requests, logs will be filled with the string 'combinedSSL' and nothing else.

>Fix:
at least report 'warning: CustomLog for xxx virtualhost doesn't have a correspondant LogFormat entry', at best parse CustomLog for '%something' constructions, and try to validate its format.

State-Changed-Why:

Your solution will not work because the CostumLog directive
does not need to use a defined nickname.  Instead, it can
use an explicit logformat string.  Since literal characters
are allowed in a logformat string, apache is perfectly
happy with the format string "ssl-format" or whatever.

One solution might be to issue a warning if there is not
at least one "%" directive in the format string.  It is
highly unlikely that anyone wants to have a log with only
literals.
