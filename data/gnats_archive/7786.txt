After installing Apache via SOlaris 8 CD. I configured a minimal httpd.conf file.
when I tried to start apache I got the following error:

mmap: Bad file number
httpd: Could not mmap memory
>How-To-Repeat:
I have not had the pleasure of starting Apache and serving a web page.
>Fix:
<IfModule mod_include.c>
                 Include conf/mmap.conf
                 </IfModule>
This is not included anywhere on the SUN distribution of Apache. I search everywhere.

 I just installed Apache 1.3.22 on Sun Solaris 5.7. I tried to start apache I
 got the following error: 
 mmap: Bad file number 
 httpd: Could not mmap memory. 
 I could not see any reference to mmap in the httpd.conf file. Do you have
 the solution for this problem?
 
 Thanks!
