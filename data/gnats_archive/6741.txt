>Description:
I tried to update my server [www.workandplay.com.br is running Apache/1.3.12 (Darwin) ] to v1.3.14 and first I had problems with the names lenght. Later i had lots of error messages when decompressing the install .tar.gz file. Because this i am not able to upgrade my server.
>How-To-Repeat:
Connect to:
http://httpd.apache.org/dist/binaries/macosx/

download:
apache_1.3.14-powerpc+i386-apple-darwin1.2.tar.gz

try to decompress...   you will receive various error messages and will be not able to install the server.
>Fix:
the name of the files in this ftp folder is too big.
i can't download files with those names to my OS X.
maybe the problem is only the compression.
