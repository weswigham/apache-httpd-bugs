Compiler: Output from gcc -v:
  Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/egcs-2.91.60/specs

>Description:
The include statement

<!--#if expr="$HTTP_USER_AGENT=/Mozilla\/(.)/" -->
arbitrary text/statement here
<!--#endif -->

results in the error: [an error occurred while processing this directive]
The error log contains the statement:
Invalid expression "$HTTP_USER_AGENT=/Mozilla\/(.)/" in file ...

Without the parentheses () the expression works fine, but I want to use
the reference later.
