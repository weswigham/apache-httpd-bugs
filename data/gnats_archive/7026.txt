#I reported this problem on 30/Dec/2000 (PR#7022), but it has overwritten by the other PR.

ap_get_server_port doesn't return the real listening port number.
>How-To-Repeat:
Listen 8080, and try to get /cgi-bin/printenv.

>Fix:
The following patch corrects this problem, but I'm afraid that this would cause some side effects.

 I see, but your reply is about the result of some directives.
 I've reported about the API function.
 
 See the current document about this function:

 This seems to say that the ap_get_server_port returns the *actual*
 listening TCP port number, but it always doesn't do so. I think there
 is a bug about documentation, implementation, or design.
 
 I think that there should be a function that returns the actual
 listening port number, but there are no such functions now.

 Yes, because these directioves control the behaviour of the API
 function. Wherever Apache needs to know its own port number it calls
 that function, so that the sysadmin can control what port number is
 returned.
 
 Think of situations where there is some load-balancing device in front
 of the server that accepts connections on port 80 and forwards them to
 the server running on port 8080. To the external world Apache appears
 to be running on port 80, so when it creates self-referential URLs it
 must use that port number, not the port 8080 that it gets from
 getsockname().

 Documentation bug.
