>Environment:
IRIX guinness 5.3 11091812 IP22 mips
Standard IRIX 5.3 Compiler
the dbm auth mod built in
Fast CGI (java)
>Description:
Accesses stopped being logged until the server was restarted.  No
errors were reported.  (the logfile was not being rotated)
>How-To-Repeat:
I can't repeat it.  Been running the server for over 2 months in
this config and this is the first (and only time so far) it has
happened.
>Fix:
Isn't this why you all get paid the big bucks? <*grin*%3

State-Changed-Why:
There's nothing apache-specific that should cause this to happen
-- especially since each child has a separate handle to the log file.
But just in case you should upgrade to 1.2b10 where several race
conditions were corrected.  If you find some way to reproduce the
behaviour please report it again.

Thanks for using Apache!
