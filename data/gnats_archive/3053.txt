State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the report. A fix has been applied which will
be incorporated into the next release. This fixes the
message if you run Apache with -u, -i or -S, or when 
you run it after stopping it with the service manager
on NT.

(Note you will still get it if you use ^C to stop Apache,
but from the next release there will be a way to shutdown
Apache properly on Win9x, which will remove the PID file
properly)
