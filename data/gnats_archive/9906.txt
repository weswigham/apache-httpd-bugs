>Description:
Just wondering why the AddLanguage thing by default adds Swedish (sv) files as .se (which is the abbreviation for Sweden) instead of using the ISO639 'sv' for Swedish. The language Swedish does not imply that it's about Sweden (could be Finland etc as well), and Sweden does not imply Swedish (although that is more common).
>How-To-Repeat:
Check the default config file.
>Fix:
Change to AddLanguage sv .sv
