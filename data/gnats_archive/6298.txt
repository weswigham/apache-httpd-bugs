NT 4.0 service pack 5.  JDK 1.2.2, but I'm running the precompiled
software.  Let me know what properties might be useful.
>Description:
After rebooting my system without a
clean shutdown, I`m not able to restart the Apache servlets process.  The error
is:

C:\>"c:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\Apache.exe" -d "c:\Program Files\Apach
e Group\Apache" -s
[Thu Jul 06 14:52:47 2000] [warn] pid file c:/program files/apache group/apache/
logs/httpd.pid overwritten -- Unclean shutdown of previous Apache run?
[Thu Jul 06 14:52:47 2000] [crit] Apache JServ encountered a fatal error; check
your ApJServLogFile for details if none are present in this file.  Exiting.

The mod_jserv.log file contains:
[06/07/2000 21:50:54:687] (INFO) wrapper: Shutdown done (PID=105)
[06/07/2000 21:50:54:750] (INFO) Apache Module was cleaned-up

[06/07/2000 21:52:47:781] (INFO) wrapper: can not open/create semaphore
[06/07/2000 21:52:47:781] (ERROR) an error returned initializing protocol "wrapper"
[06/07/2000 21:52:47:781] (ERROR) in init all protocols "wrapper" returned an error
[06/07/2000 21:52:47:781] (EMERGENCY) Error initializing protocols

If there is a semaphore out there on NT,
I can`t find it.  The apache source calls
CreateSemaphore with a name "jserv-wrapper-semaphore", but this file doesn`t exist.  I`ve checked the apache web site FAQ and bug database also and couldn`t find anything.  NT help doesn`t talk about semaphores.  I'm not using any
lockfile option either.

How do I fix this "can not open/create semaphore" error on NT?
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.  It wasn't a clean shutdown and I'm running HP espeak,
but the environment was ok before the restart.
>Fix:
No.
