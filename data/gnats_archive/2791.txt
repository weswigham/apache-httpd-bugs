>Environment:
Windows 95a 4.00.950a
>Description:
CTRL-C cannot be sent to DOS based application from external Windows based
program (Visual Basic). Attempted to use Windows functions SendKeys("^(C)"),
Clipboard passing (Clipboard.Clear, Clipboard.SetText, SendKeys("%( )EP")) to
no avail. It is necessary to shut the server down via my external application
in preparation for a total system reboot.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to get server to shutdown from external programming language.
>Fix:
Allow Apache to stop when a string is passed (or typed at the keyboard).
Something hard to type by accident, 'ShUtDoWn'? Then any application that
can utilize the Clipboard functions could shutdown server.

BTW, 1.3b3 is really ancient; you should upgrade to 1.3.1.
The issue is still there, but the software is much more
stable.

 Upgraded to 1.3.1..
 
 Remote administration with the ability to send CTRL-C to Apache would
 also be acceptable, if there is a known way to do this.

 Thank you for the update.
 I have already upgraded and implemented this corrective action.
 It works fine, thanks to all in the Apache Group for this addition!!
