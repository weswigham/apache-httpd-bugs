>Description:
I have always the message "Expected </xxx> but saw </xxx>" (where xxx is 
Directory, File, VirtualHost, ... in httpd.conf, access.conf, srm.conf) when
starting Apache (apachectl start).

The problem come from src/main/httpd_core.c when Apache compare 2 strings in
the function end_nested_section() with the operator != to compare the 2 string
pointers. When I replace this comparison with a string comparison strcmp(),
it's work.

(Sorry for my english)


    if (cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token) {
        return ap_pstrcat(cmd->pool, "Expected ", cmd->end_token, " but saw ",
                          cmd->cmd->name, NULL);
    }

==========>>>>>>>>>>>>

    if (strcmp(cmd->cmd->name,cmd->end_token)) {
        return ap_pstrcat(cmd->pool, "Expected ", cmd->end_token, " but saw ",
                          cmd->cmd->name, NULL);
    }
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, see the source of http_core.c
>Fix:
Replace the comparison != with a string compare strcmp() in the function
end_nested_section() (in http_core.c).

State-Changed-Why:
Please search tbe bugdb for previous reports of this.  The
pointer comparison is correct; the resaon it isn't working for you is
that there is a bug in your compiler.  Use gcc.  There should
also be patches available for your compiler; search for the
pervious PRs on this for details.
