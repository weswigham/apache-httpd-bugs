>Description:
We're seeing a problem with IE5 and having to click a "submit" button twice.  We're not sure if it's related to Apache.  We have found that when we turn off HTTP 1.1 in IE5 it works fine.  Is there a way through Apache, either through the BROWSERMATCH directive or otherwise, to force an HTTP 1.0 response to make it work?

 "Re: config/5840"
 This may help...
 I have notice this on other sites not running Apache server but when I
 access sites thru a proxy server(squid).
 When I access sites thru another connection running different proxy server
 or no proxy... then is normal clicks for IE5
 I never thought it was apache i think is IE5 and ISP config of Squid.
