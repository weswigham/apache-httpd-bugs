>Description:
I am running the latest Apache and Apache-JServ.
Within mod-jserv.conf I have the following:
	ApJServAction .cat /servlets/CheetahDoc

I request a file as follows:
	http://localhost/dir/index.cat

Apache reports the following error:
	The requested URL /dir/index.cat was not found on this server.

My servlet was never accessed at all.

If I request this file my servlet is accessed:
	http://localhost/index./cat

The problem stems from whether there is a subdirectory "dir".
If there is then Apache will pass control to my servlet,
however, if there is not them Apache will jump in with the "not found" error without letting my servlet handle it.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Give the servlet a chance to handle the situation
