>Description:
In order to load mod_log_config you need to know that it must be loaded with:

LoadModule config_log_module /usr/lib/apache/mod_log_config.so

but the documentation for mod_log_config never mentions config_log_module.
Similarly for mod_negotiation, and libssl.

Perhaps a "Module Name" should be included in the docs?
