Problem:
I installed Apache 1.3.9 on a (freshly setup) machine and accepted all
the default settings.

I wanted to to use the option "Install Apache as Service (NT only)" 
in the Start menu. It didn't register Apache as a Service.

Doing it in a DOS-Box (apache -i -n "Apache") did the job.

I tried to start apache. From the Services-window it wouldn't start up giving
me an "1067 System Error" and a message that Apache terminated unexpectedly.

Starting the service up in a DOS-Box (net start apache) gave me the same error message.

I tried to start Apache in a DOS-Box (apache -n "apache"). Now I received
a more enlightning message. It said something like:

Can not find localhost. Use ServerName Directive to solve the problem.

When I looked into the httpd.conf file and checked for the ServerName
directive I realized that there was a wrong name here (created by the
install procedure).

In my case it was enough to change the ServerName directive (to 127.0.0.1 - it
was a local test server).

I unregistered the apache service (apache -u -n "Apache") and registered
it again (apache -i -n "Apache) - maybe this is not necessary. 

Now I was able to start it any way I wanted.

The the option "Install Apache as Service (NT only)" in the Start menu
still didn't work.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
1. During installation the ServerName directive should be automatically
   set to localhost!
2. Fix the the option "Install Apache as Service (NT only)" - no solution here.
