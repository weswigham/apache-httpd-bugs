>Description:
With "ProxyVia full" on, I expected the Via: header to include names and
versions of modules that has called ap_add_version_comment() to be included
in the comment (so it would be consistent with the Server: header).

This is the Via: header of 1.3.9 (with ProxyVia full):
Via: 1.1 proxy.example.com (Apache/1.3.9)

This is what I'd like the Via: header to contain:
Via: 1.1 proxy.example.com (Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) mod_perl/1.21)
