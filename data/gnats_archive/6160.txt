1)Following is the output duing running Configure
$ ./Configure
Using config file: Configuration
Creating Makefile
Sorry, but we cannot grok "hp9000_811-hpux10.20"
uname -m

uname: illegal option -- X
usage: uname [-amnrsvil] [-S nodename]
Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html. If you don't
wish to do the port yourself, please submit this output rather
than the patches. Thank you.

Pressing on with the build process, but all bets are off.
Do not be surprised if it fails. If it works, and even
if it does not, please contact the above address.

 + configured for Unknown and unsupported OS platform
 + setting C compiler to cc
 + setting C pre-processor to cc -E
 + checking for system header files
 + adding selected modules
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!
2)I read through the document, PORTING and ./helpers/GuessOS It seem to me that 
  the script is using command "uname -X"
  I run this command manully at command prompt, I discover that my OS does not
  support this option(ie, -X)
3)Can you tell me what is -X what info is -X trying to gether and is that an
  alternative
>How-To-Repeat:
it is repeatable when running ./Configure
>Fix:
need to find an alternative for uname -X
