 This ever so friendly error is irix cc's way of saying that some .o or .a
 is not in the right format.  That usually happens if you build another
 architecture first in an NFS mounted directory.  Make sure to do a "make
 clean".  It's also possible that you're mixing -n32 and -o32 objects.

State-Changed-Why:
User had built with gcc previously, and make clean didn't
clean up everything.  Rebuilding from fresh package worked
fine.
