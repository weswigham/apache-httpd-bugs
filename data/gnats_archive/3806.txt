Linux catilina.becomsys.de 2.0.36 #4 Fri Nov 20 12:03:23 MET 1998 i586 unknown
>Description:
If I send a POST request including an Expect: 100-continue header, but
without transmitting the message body to a
none-existing CGI-Skript, apache sends neither a 100 (Continue) nor a 
404 (Not Found) response. It waits until it has read the entity-body
completely and sends the 404 response then. This clearly violates chapter
8.2.3 (first server requirement) of the rev 6 of the HTTP/1.1 draft. 
100-continue works pretty well, if the resource exits.

Example:
client->server
  POST /cgi-bin/test-cgi2 HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.localnet:8080
  Connection: close
  Content-Type: text/plain
  Content-Length: 11
  Expect: 100-continue
  <empty line>

server->client:
  <nothing>

client->server:
  Hello World

server->client:
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  Date: Mon, 01 Feb 1999 10:44:15 GMT
  Server: Apache/1.3.4 (Unix)
  Connection: close
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked
  Content-Type: text/html
  <empty line>
