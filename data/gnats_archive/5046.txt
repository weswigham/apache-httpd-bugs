I have an urgent problem for which solution is required so i have
taken the freedom to ask you.

To enable the Dynamic Shared Object(DSO) module_so ,

we have to execute the following command at the prompt :

$ env LIBS=/usr/lib/libC.so.5 CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --enable-module=so

(Instead of just ./configure, we have to use the env ... coz we
are using gcc compiler, also the $PATH is /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/GCC281/bin)

The configuration executes fine 
ls1-cw# env LIBS=/usr/lib/libC.so.5 CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --enable-module=so 

Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.3

Creating Makefile

Creating Configuration.apaci in src

Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Solaris 260 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
+ adding selected modules
+ using -ldl for vendor DSO support
+ doing sanity check on compiler and options
Creating Makefile in src/support
Creating Makefile in src/main
Creating Makefile in src/ap
Creating Makefile in src/regex
Creating Makefile in src/os/unix
Creating Makefile in src/modules/standard



BUT WHILE BUILDING WITH THE "make" OPTION IT FAILS AND GIVES
an output , listed below ,which i am not able to interpret .

Also for GCC header files it points out the right path as you can see below
i.e from /opt/GCC281/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.6/2.8.1/include/limits.h:11,
but still says no such file or directory. Rest of the header files are not on the 
solaris system like errno.h, stdio.h in /usr/include
