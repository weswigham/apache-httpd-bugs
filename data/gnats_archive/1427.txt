i.e., Redhat 4.2, no patches applied, was able to compile 1.2.4 from source
>Description:
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/landgren/apache_1.3b2/src/support'
gcc  -DLINUX=2  htdigest.c -o htdigest  -lm -lcrypt
In file included from ../main/md5c.c:88,
                 from htdigest.c:20:
../main/conf.h:62: os.h: No such file or directory

I.e., the make bombed out with a missing include file (os.h). My hypothesis is
that an include switch for the compiler was missing. I looked at Makefile.tmpl
and made the following change:

htdigest: htdigest.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) htdigest.c -o htdigest $(LIBS)

became

htdigest: htdigest.c
        $(CC) $(INCLUDES) $(CFLAGS) htdigest.c -o htdigest $(LIBS)
              ^^^^^^^^^^^

I then when back to the base directory and ran 'make clean;make'. This time I
received the following error

gcc  -I../regex -I../os/unix -I../main    -DLINUX=2  htdigest.c -o htdigest  -lm -lcrypt
/tmp/cca148411.o: In function `main':
htdigest.c(.text+0x2cb0): undefined reference to `ap_signal'
htdigest.c(.text+0x2cb4): undefined reference to `ap_signal'
(note the weird (segment+offset) line number)

I have tracked down ap_signal to the following file: ./src/main/conf.h:

/*
 * Replace signal function with sigaction equivalent
 */
#ifndef NO_USE_SIGACTION
typedef void Sigfunc(int);

#if defined(SIG_IGN) && !defined(SIG_ERR)
#define SIG_ERR ((Sigfunc *)-1)
#endif

/*
 * For some strange reason, QNX defines signal to signal. Eliminate it.
 */
#ifdef signal
#undef signal
#endif
#define signal(s,f)     ap_signal(s,f)
Sigfunc *signal(int signo, Sigfunc * func);
#endif

As far as I can see (find . -type f -exec grep -l ap_signal {} \;), this is
the only occurrence of the string "ap_signal" anywhere in the source 
distribution. Since 'ap' reminds me of 'Apache', I'm not going to grep my
/usr tree. Thus, I don't think this can fly.

I'm lost. Please advise.

Also note, my machine is a 64-bit Alpha, and as such, warns of what are
possible 32-bit assumptions (int* != int):

gcc -c  -I../regex -I../os/unix -I../main    -DLINUX=2   http_config.c
http_config.c: In function `set_file_slot':
http_config.c:875: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size

htpasswd.c: In function `add_password':
htpasswd.c:125: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast

Also note the macro redefines:
/usr/include/netinet/tcp.h:97: warning: `TCP_NODELAY' redefined
/usr/include/linux/socket.h:128: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
/usr/include/netinet/tcp.h:98: warning: `TCP_MAXSEG' redefined
/usr/include/linux/socket.h:129: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
>How-To-Repeat:
Um, slaughter a goat during the next full moon? (I mean, this must have worked
correctly for you, right)?
>Fix:
Is my change to ./src/support/Makefile.tmpl kosher?

The macro redefines should be guarded with #ifdefs:
#ifndef TCP_NODELAY
#define TCP_NODELAY (0xf00f) /* whatever */
#endif
