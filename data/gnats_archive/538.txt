Linux 1.2.29 (not relevant)
>Description:
allow id.wustl.edu applies not only to 'id.wustl.edu', but also to all
'host.id.wustl.edu'. A better syntax would be 'allow id.wustl.edu' for
the host, and 'allow .id.wustl.edu' for the subdomain. This is also
true for IP addresses, but of no consequence, since all IP addresses
are the same length (4 pos).
Note: The current behavior is consistent with the docs, but not
optimal IMHO.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try 'allow apache.org'. This will also allow www.apache.org. 'allow
.apache.org' allows the entire subdomain, but there is no way to allow
only 'apache.org'.
>Fix:
mod_access 'else return (domain[0] == '.' || what[wl-dl-1] == '.');' to
'else return (domain[0] == '.' && what[wl-dl-1] == '.');'
