>Description:
With apache-1.2.4 my httpd.conf file contains the following VirtualHost
section...

Listen www-proxy.ats:8082
<VirtualHost www-proxy.ats:8082>
  ServerName		www-proxy.ats
  ProxyRequests		On
  ProxyRemote		*		http://internet2.eds.com:81
</VirtualHost>

My browser (Netscape Navigator 3.0) is set to make proxy requests to
www-proxy.ats:8082 for all URLs outside the company intranet.  The
ProxyRemote directive in this virtual host forwards them to a firewall
(internet2).

When I attempt to access a URL outside the intranet the firewall
requests a user ID and password.  I enter these in the normal
Navigator dialog box and my request goes out on the internet.

I have tried the same virtual host setting with apache-1.3b3 and it
does not work.  The firewall requests authentication as before and
Navigator pops up its dialog box, but when I enter the correct user ID
and password Navigator comes back with a "Proxy Authorization Failed -
Retry" dialog box.



This problem seems to be restricted to ProxyRemote authentication.  My
apache-1.2.4 httpd.conf also contains this...

Listen www-proxy.ats:8080
<VirtualHost www-proxy.ats:8080>
  ServerName		www-proxy.ats
  ProxyRequests		On
</VirtualHost>

This virtual host allows users on our office LAN to get out onto the
company intranet (the apache server sits on both networks).  Navigator
is set to make proxy requests to www-proxy.ats:8080 for URLs within
the company intranet.  Apache goes and fetches the URL and returns it
to the browser.  If the intranet server requests authentication then
Navigator prompts as before and the request is granted.  This works
for both 1.2.4 and 1.3b3.

>How-To-Repeat:
1. Set up a firewall proxy server that always requests user authentication.

2. Configure an apache-1.3b3 virtual host to ProxyRemote all proxy requests to the
firewall proxy server.

3. Configure a browser to send proxy requests to the apache-1.3b3 proxy.

4. Use the browser to visit a URL that requires the use of the proxy.

=> The user authentication at the firewall should fail.

Repeat the above with apache-1.2.4.  This should work correctly.

State-Changed-Why:
Hi.  Sorry about the delay; there hasn't been anyone working
on the proxy module in awhile.

In doing research on this I found the patch which implemented
this: 

http://www.apache.org/websrc/cvsweb.cgi/apache-1.3/src/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c.diff?r1=1.20&r2=1.21

The thread of discussion on this can be found in the archives
for the month of July 1997, at

http://dev.apache.org/mail/nh.9705.gz

unzip it and read it in pine or something, and look for
a thread called "proxy auth".  You'll see that
it was done even though folks knew that it could cause a 
problem like this.  Basically, the HTTP spec says that a proxy
should "absorb" the header and not forward it along if the
credentials being presented are for that proxy. Unfortunately
we absorb it unconditionally.

So to properly fix this we need to block that header only if
we are the proxy server requiring those credentials.  Also
consider the possibility of *two* Proxy-Authorization headers,
one for "us" and one for one of the next proxies down the 
chain.

At this point we're strapped for resources in the proxy
department, so if you think you could implement a fix
we'd be ecstatic.  Failing that, I think it's better to
always block than anyways relay when those are your only
options.

Thanks for the note.

 The Apache Bug database hasn't replied to my bug report yet so I can't
 send you this extra info the correct way.  Sorry.  However I have found
 a way to fix this problem.  Here's the patch...

 !             )
             continue;
         bvputs(f, reqhdrs[i].key, ": ", reqhdrs[i].val, "\015\012",
 NULL);
       }
 
 
 Apache was changed between 1.2.4 and 1.3b3 to suppress the
 "Proxy-Authorization" header field.  I'm not too sure why, but allowing
 it through as before fixes the problem.
