>Environment:
Win 98 with only the MS-SDK installed (no Sun JDK)
>Description:
I have a solution to the problems described in PR #3614. The problem is it can't find %java_exe%, which turns out to be the value of the Java VM the install is looking for (java.exe for the Sun JDK and jview.exe for the MS JDK).

>How-To-Repeat:
Install mod_jserv on Win32 with ONLY the MS-SDK.
>Fix:
Someone basically did not expand the value of %java_exe% when putting up the error message. The REAL problem is that the installer seems to ALWAYS look for "java.exe" NEVER for "jview.exe" 

I was able to fix the problem by 

1) Waiting for the "Can't find" error message.
2) Renaming "jview.exe" to "java.exe" and pointing the installer at the "<MS-JDK installpath>/bin".
3) The install finishes and then I change the name back to "jview.exe" and change the jserv.properties file line "wrapper.bin" to point to "jview.exe".

Voila!!
