>Description:
As per bugs 4892 and 4894 automagic setup as service failed, so I ran spache -i manually.
Fine. But the service will not start.
I usually get:
Error 1067: Application terminated unexpectedly

(probably a pretty generic message?)

Is the ImagePath supposed to be quoted?
Though the error occurs even when there are no quotes
