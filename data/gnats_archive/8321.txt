>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux RedHat 7.1, 
>Description:
Core dump when `hostname` is not a fqdn, e.g. "wooster" instead of
wooster.sdu.se.

This bug is serious only in the sense that it is difficult to
understand why apache dumps core.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set hostname to something that will cause gethostbyname to return 0.
>Fix:
Change the condition on line 2051 as indicated below. I have also rewritten the
surrounding if statement to make it a little easier to understand.
