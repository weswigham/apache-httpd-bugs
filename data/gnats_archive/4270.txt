>Description:
in reclaim_child_processes(), waittime starts at 16ms, and is multiplied by 4
each time through the loop. The comments in the switch statement say
(16, 82, 344, 1400, 6000, 14000). They should say (16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096, 16384).

I only noticed because my module takes > 1s to flush open db buffers, and was
generating "still did not exit..." messages in the logs, so I increased the
multiplier to 5.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Fix the comments, or tell me that I flunk algebra class again.

Hey peter ;)

The comments are referring to the total time... rather than
the relative time between polls.
