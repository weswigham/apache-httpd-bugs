>Environment:
Windows XP Home Edition Version 2002
>Description:
When I installed Apache, I specified that I wanted it installed as a Service.
After the installation completed, I looked at the list of installed services,
and Apache was not listed.  I went into a DOS box, and typed "NET START APACHE".
I got an error message indicating that the service did not exist.  I clicked
on Start -> Programs -> Apache HTTP Web Server.  "Start Apache in Console"
was shown as an option, but "Start Apache as Service" was not.  I know that
the installation worked OK, because when I used netscape to go to
"http://<my website name>, I got the standard Apache index.html file (well,
first I had to do the other regular stuff -- rename index.html.en to index.html,
and edit httpd.conf to listen on my IP address and port no., etc.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try installing Apache 1.3.22 as a service onto Windows XP
>Fix:
No.  I'd have to dig through the source code, which I don't know at all.  And
I'm not even sure the source code release includes the installation logic.

 Certainly untested yet - XP Home will hopefully be supportable.

 It did not install as a service, for whatever reason, 'as a service' was not
 toggled in spite of your choice.
 
 Permissions become very odd in the XP Home edition [it is an NT, after all, but
 with much logic to keep 'home' users from hurting themselves.]
 
 Try the following, in a command window of the c:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache
 directory;
 
 apache -k install -n Apache
 
 Please report the effect.  The follow commands should then work;
 
 apache -k start -n Apache
 apache -k stop -n Apache

 No, it does not.  It is available from anonymous cvs (see http://dev.apache.org/)
 by checking out the httpd-win32-msi repository.  It is built with InstallShield
 for Windows Installer, v 2.03, so it won't be -directly- usable.  Of course, MSI
 packages are directly editable with orca from the Microsoft Installer SDK, so if
 you find the magic 'keys to the kingdom' feel free to provide feedback of the
 flag.  Current flags are VersionNT and Version9x, IIRC.
 
 If the apache -k commands don't work, then you might want to investigate the
 src/os/win32/service.c code that sets up, starts and stops the service using
 the WinNT Service Control Manager API.  That API may have slid for XP Home.
