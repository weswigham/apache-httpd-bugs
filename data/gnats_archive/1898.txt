>Description:
Description isn't getting added to the autoindex html page if there is a 
wildcard in the extension.

According to the docs:
   File is a file extension, partial filename, wild-card expression or full 
   filename for files to describe.
>How-To-Repeat:
AddDescription "blah blah" filename.ext    # WORKS
AddDescription "blah blah" filename        # partial filename doesn't work
AddDescription "blah blah" filename*       # wild-card expression doesn't work
AddDescription "blah blah" filename.*      # wild-card expression doesn't work
AddDescription "blah blah" filename.       # wild-card expression doesn't work
AddDescription "blah blah" filename        # wild-card expression doesn't work
>Fix:
Bring back partial filename and wild-card expression%3

State-Changed-Why:
This is another side-effect of using fnmatch() for wildcard
expansion... mod_autoindex does really lame stuff -- it stores
full paths for everything, and this is messing up fnmatch().
I opened a PR earlier indicating that mod_autoindex was broken
in this way... I guess we really need to fix it for 1.3.

Thanks for your patience and for using Apache!
