>Environment:
Linux {myhost} 2.2.15-4mdk #1 Wed May 10 15:31:30 CEST 2000 i686 unknown
>Description:
This bug disables using map expansion in mod_rewrite (e.g., in RewriteCond, 
RewriteRule etc.). The expression that should have been substituted is
returned as part of the uri. The reason for this can be found in
find_char_in_brackets(), which doesn't count the brackets correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
RewriteMap mymap txt:/home/httpd/maps/mymap.txt

RewriteCond ${mymap:%{HTTP_HOST}} !^root$
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://${mymap:%{HTTP_HOST}}$1 [R=301]
>Fix:
Small patch for me, but a large fix for mankind. ;-)
