>Organization:
>Environment:
Operating System:
  Sun Solaris 2.7 (SPARC)
Compiler:
  GNU CC (gcc) 2.8.1
Additional Third-Party Apache Modules:
  (none)
Additional Software:
  PHP/4.0.6 (using the CGI interface)
>Description:
The HTTP authentication variables usually seen by CGI scripts, namely AUTH_TYPE
and REMOTE_USER, are not being propogated to "Action" scripts even though they
are working for regular CGI scripts.  Tested a number of Apache versions to
check this, each using an identical httpd.conf/.htaccess environment:

  Apache/1.3.22 (Unix) - works for both CGI and Action
  Apache/2.0.16 (Unix) - works for CGI, Action fails
  Apache/2.0.27 (Unix) - works for CGI, Action fails

With each of these versions, if you call the standard "test-cgi" CGI shell
script after configuring Apache to authenticate access to the script, the
variables REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE are clearly visible.  If you call a PHP
script that prints these variables when PHP runs as an Action (see below),
Apache/1.3.22 works but both Apache 2.0.x versions fail.

Further, access_log shows the authenticated user for each request under 1.3.22
but under both 2.0.x versions there is no user ID logged;  again, this is using
an identical httpd.conf/.htaccess configuration.

The action is configured simply as per:

Action application/x-httpd-php /cgi-bin/phpwrap

PHPWrap is a shell script that dumps all environment variables prior to exec'g
PHP proper - this was done to see if the problem was PHP's or Apache's;  it is
clear from this that the problem is Apache's as the REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE
variables are never passed to PHP under 2.0.x but work under 1.3.22.

Unfortunately with both REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE missing, a number of Web
applications written using HTTP authentication all fail to operate, making
this a critical fault (certainly before Apache 2.0 goes "production" anyway).
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure PHP to use the CGI interface, configure Apache to call PHP using an
"Action" then try running a few regular CGI scripts versus PHP scripts when
authenticated - REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE appear for the regular CGI scripts
but never appear (and no user details are logged) for the Action-driven
scripts.
>Fix:
Unfortunately not;  I've had a quick look at the 2.0.16 source code and there
does not appear to be any major difference between how REMOTE_ADDR and
REMOTE_USER are handled, yet REMOTE_ADDR is present for all scripts and has no
problems - clearly the problem is more fundamental and requires a more
intimate knowledge of Apache 2.0 internals.

 Tested again on Apache/2.0.28 - problem still persists.  Example regular CGI
 script (that works):
 
   #! /sbin/sh
   set -f
   echo Content-type: text/plain
   echo
   echo SERVER_SOFTWARE = $SERVER_SOFTWARE
   echo GATEWAY_INTERFACE = $GATEWAY_INTERFACE
   echo SERVER_PROTOCOL = $SERVER_PROTOCOL
   echo HTTP_USER_AGENT = $HTTP_USER_AGENT
   echo
   echo REMOTE_ADDR = $REMOTE_ADDR
   echo REMOTE_USER = $REMOTE_USER
   echo AUTH_TYPE = $AUTH_TYPE
 
 Example PHP script, called as an Apache "Action" with PHP configured to use
 the CGI interface (wherein REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE are always missing):
 
   <?php
     header("Content-type: text/plain");
     print "SERVER_SOFTWARE = " . $HTTP_ENV_VARS["SERVER_SOFTWARE"] . "\n";
     print "GATEWAY_INTERFACE = " . $HTTP_ENV_VARS["GATEWAY_INTERFACE"] . "\n";
     print "SERVER_PROTOCOL = " . $HTTP_ENV_VARS["SERVER_PROTOCOL"] . "\n";
     print "HTTP_USER_AGENT = " . $HTTP_ENV_VARS["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] . "\n";
     print "\n";
     print "REMOTE_ADDR = " . $HTTP_ENV_VARS["REMOTE_ADDR"] . "\n";
     print "REMOTE_USER = " . $HTTP_ENV_VARS["REMOTE_USER"] . "\n";
     print "AUTH_TYPE = " . $HTTP_ENV_VARS["AUTH_TYPE"] . "\n";
   ?>
 
 Works under 1.3.22, fails under 2.0.28.  Manual TELNET to the port and request
 (GET) the PHP script results in an "Authorization Required" error indicating
 that the authentication side of things is definitely configured correctly.

 Four months later - re-tried with latest release (Apache/2.0.32) - problem
 still persists;  no improvement to access_log symptom nor CGI environment
 variable symptom.

State-Changed-Why:
A bit of progress on this PR:

In Apache 1.3, ap_add_common_vars() sets REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE from c->user and c->ap_auth_type, whereas
in Apache 2.0, ap_add_common_vars() sets REMOTE_USER and
AUTH_TYPE from r->user and r->ap_auth_type.
But mod_actions runs the script as a subrequest, and 
r->user and r->ap_auth_type aren't set there.

Hopefully this can get resolved in the next few days.

Thanks for your report.

After looking at the code, it is clear that with Apache 
2.0 you need to set up authorization for the target of 
the subrequest (/cgi-bin/phpwrap in your case).  
/cgi-bin/phpwrap would need to be protected anyway in
case the client could request that resource anyway
(e.g., specify /cgi-bin/phpwrap directly).

Please set up authorization for /cgi-bin/phpwrap and let
us know if the problem is resolved.

 BTW, is "apache-bugdb@" sufficient or do you need both it and "apbugs@"?
 There is an inconsistency between the comments in the email and the actual
 email address used.

 Is the auth'd user now logged in access_log?  Yes.
 Are the appropriate CGI variables now available to PHP scripts?  Yes.
 Is this an acceptable solution/work-around?  Not really - see below.

 Why such a fundamental shift from Apache 1.3?  There are a number of problems
 with this approach:
 
 - Subrequests utilising generalised scripting engines are not the ultimate
   target of authentication anyway, that's the original content.
 
 - The authentication actually happened with the original content, it's just
   not visible either in the access_log nor to the script (run by the engine,
   which is in turn run as a subrequest from within Apache).
 
 - Since you'd now need to apply authentication to every subrequest target
   you can't have just one copy of the generalised scripting engine installed;
   one for each separate authentication realm on the Web server, plus one for
   non-authenticated requests.  This is quickly spiralling outta control...
 
 - Then there's the basic end-user confusion of why something that seemed
   logical and worked with Apache 1.3 no longer works with 2.0.  :-(
 
 I guess I'm asking for some logical rationale as to why this was changed for
 Apache 2.0 - at this stage, it seems pretty dumb to me.  :-(

 At first I agreed whole-heartedly with this (and generally speaking, still
 agree) - then I remembered (and tried) PHP's built-in security in this regard;
 I requested "/cgi-bin/phpwrap" directly (with no authentication) and got what
 I expected:
 
   Security Alert! PHP CGI cannot be accessed directly.
 
   This PHP CGI binary was compiled with force-cgi-redirect enabled. This means
   that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable is
   set. This variable is set, for example, by Apache's Action directive
   redirect.
 
 It should be possible to still protect the "subrequest target" in this case
 anyway by just refusing requests wherein the request URI contains/matches
 "/cgi-bin/phpwrap" without screwing up subrequest processing (since in that
 case the _real_ subrequest target would only appear in the SCRIPT_xxx
 variables, not in REQUEST_xxx, REDIRECT_xxx or PATH_xxx).
 
 Thanks..
