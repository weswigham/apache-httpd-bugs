>Description:
Problem was:
When viewing directory listings with ftp proxy and the first filename in the list contained spaces the links and filenames were all corrupted.

I found some more robust directory parsing code in the squid proxy. I rewrote it to work inside proxy_ftp.c .

I hope I'm not breaking squid's copyright by posting this.

My revised file is at:
ftp://ftp.characterlink.net/proxy/
>How-To-Repeat:
View an ftp directory using the Apache Proxy where the first filename in the list contains spaces.
>Fix:
ftp://ftp.characterlink.net/proxy

State-Changed-Why:
The patch you mentioned isn't at the location
ftp://ftp.characterlink.net/proxy/ any longer. Please
submit the patch in a reply or send it to <martin@apache.org>.
Does Squid's license allow inclusion onto apache, or did
you rewrite the code yourself based on information in squid's
code?

Responsible-Changed-Why:
I will check the code; I knew the ftp proxy "parser" had
a very weak error tolerance.
