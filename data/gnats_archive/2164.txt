>Environment:
Apache 1.3b6 precompiled from apache.org, Win95OSR2 & NT 4.0 WS, 64Megs RAM
>Description:
Using the ErrorDocument does not work inside a <VirtualHost> directive
(Of course added inside the httpd.conf).

When none is defined, I get the ones I have modified that reside
in c:/apache/errormsg/, as predefined in the srm.conf.
(ErrorDocument 401 /errormsg/401.htm  <- IN SRM.CONF)

When some are defined, it is configed as such:
(Error docs in: c:/apache/error-s10/)
<VirtualHost>
ErrorDocument 401 /error-s10/401.htm
-> Other config directives <-
</VirtualHost>

As I said, when none are defined in the VH, the ones
defined in srm.conf are displayed.  When they are defined,
the ones in neither /errormsg/ or /error-s10/ are displayed,
but internal server message is displayed.

Documents are present, valid and not corrupt.  Paths are
correct and valid.

ErrorDocument was given proper arguments as specified in
Apache's docs.

PLEASE READ:
I have submitted this PR even after reading other PRs on
the ErrorDocument directive because the other PRs *DO NOT*
relate to this particular situation.

State-Changed-Why:
What is in the error log?

If you try accessing http://vhostname/error-s10/401.htm
does it load properly?  (where vhostname is the vhost in
question).

Do you have an alias setup to direct /error-s10/ to
c:/apache/error-s10/ ?

 No.  
 
 >Do you have an alias setup to direct /error-s10/ to
 >c:/apache/error-s10/ ?
 
 No, there was not one.  I was going on the assumption
 that it would be read from the server root as defined
 in srm.conf or httpd.conf, and Apache would issue it
 instead of the server generated error message.
 I did add the alias, and still the same output.
 
 However, I found that when I removed the
 <Location>---</Location> directive block,
 the ErrorDocument did work correctly now.  :)
 
 
 Many thanks Marc!  I -=>SHOULD<=- have
 realized an alias needed to be set, since
 I had even set one for /systemimages/!!!
 
 I gotta quit working such late hours!
 
 Now, I suggest a reference to needing
 an alias directive be added to the docs
 under ErrorDocument and VirtualHost.  :(

State-Changed-Why:
User config error.

It is clearly documented that what is expected is a URL,
not a path, so there is no need to tell people to add an
alias and most people don't need an alias because generally
people would reference something in their DocumentRoot.

 Yes, clearly documented, but still _can_ be confusing.

 True, people would normally reference docs and binaries in
 there DocumentRoot.  However, if there was confusion in
 the above circumstance it would not be so apperant.
 
 I only _suggested_ adding the reference that it is suggested
 to use the alias directive, as you are actually accessing
 a URL and not a local path.  
 
 Come on Marc, I'm not going to start crying and bitchin',
 were here to help each other.  I dont think I'm a dumbass,
 and there are people like me that read the docs (RTFM,
 ring a bell?) _before_ we ask questions.  Ive been working
 on this "problem" for going on 4.5 hours straight, trying
 everything and anything I could figure!  And to complicate
 things, the trailing forward slash thingy from 1.3b3 to
 1.3b6 had me wondering if I was even holding my mouth
 righ!  
 
 All I'm saying is if there was just one line of text
 saying someting like "Remember to use an alias to the path, dummy"
 I would have figured it out in 20 minutes tops!
 
 Please, dont take me wrong... I'm not being critical, I'm trying
 to be helpfull and supportive!  I'd give my left nut if thats
 what it took to keep the Apache project alive!  
 
 You are smart, very smart!  Much more so than me, and
 like I said, I like to at least _think_ I'm no dummy...
 Theres got to be others like me, ay?
 
 Marc, thanks a million for your help!   You wont hear
 from me unless its a last resort.  I always go to the
 "help desk" last!
 
 Usegroups... Good sugestion, but many of the others are
 more confused about the simpler things than I am about
 the "complex"... Whenever possible, I hang out there
 and help out.  I like to think its what makes Apache
 unique from the others.
 
 
 In closing, let me know if there is any way I can
 be of service to you (Apache), that is of course
 besides closing my ISP account so I cant bug ya'
 any more!  <G!>
 
 Take care,
 Andrew

 Quite understandable.  Once the problem was fixed, I realized
 I was in error submiting the PR.  
 
 Thanks,
