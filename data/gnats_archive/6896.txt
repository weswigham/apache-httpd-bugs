egcs-2.91.66

Server Version: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) mod_perl/1.24_01 PHP/4.0.3pl1 FrontPage/4.0.4.3

>Description:
A customer's web site contained a one-liner in their index.shtml:

	<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/cgiprog"-->

the CGI program is a self-contained perl CGI script that takes POST data (if
present) and acts on it.  If there isn't any POST data, it generates a form
that when submitted POSTs data back to itself (at the non-/cgi-bin URL).

This was working until the server was upgraded from 1.3.12 to 1.3.14, and it
now results in:

	Method Not Allowed
	The requested method POST is not allowed for the URL /index.shtml

Specifically allowing POST in the <Directory> via <Limit> didn't seem to do the
trick.  A partial workaround was to write a PHP script to take the place of the
.shtml:

	<?php
		$get="http://xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/cgiprog";
		$cal=$HTTP_POST_VARS["cal"];
		if ($cal != "") {
			$get .= "?cal=$cal";
		}
		$fd = fopen($get, "r");
		fpassthru($fd);
	?>

...however, all POST variables need to be takent into account in the PHP, and
any cookies aren't passed along either (because it's PHP that's really making
the request, not the viewer's browser...)

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.evcal.com/jrw is a .shtml that includes /cgi-bin/jrw

http://www.evcal.com/cgi-bin/jrw will work, but the customer doesn't want the
cgi-bin portion of the URL to show.

 What modules did you add to your 1.3.12 installation?

 I haven't tried to reproduce this problem, but from looking at the
 changelog and the differences between some of the relevant code I
 can't see how this can have happened. Can you reproduce the problem
 with a vanilla Apache installation -- no additional modules beyond
 the base distribution?
 
 (I hope I can get this email out before we go for releasing 1.3.15 on
 Monday -- I'm on a plane at the moment and I'll be on vacation this
 weekend with strictly limited connectivity.)
 
 Tony.
