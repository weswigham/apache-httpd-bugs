>Description:
The scoreboard connection count (conn_count) is an 'unsigned short int',
which generally translates to 8 bits, i.e., a range of 0..255.
This is fine when HARD_SERVER_LIMIT is left at the default of 256,
but necessarily causes some problems when it and MaxClients are larger.
>How-To-Repeat:
Raise HARD_SERVER_LIMIT and MaxClients above 256, and give Apache some
appropriate traffic with ab.  Pour small glass of Cognac.  Enjoy.
The problem is nicely evident when looking at the server status report.
