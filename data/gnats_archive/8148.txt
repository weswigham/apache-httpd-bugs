>Organization:
>Environment:
SuSE Linux 7.1, kernal 2.2.18, SuSE supplied Apache.
>Description:
I have the plain vanilla virtualHost configuration... One IP, several
domain names. Each domain name is supported by DNS A record.

Most of the time, Apache serves the proper files for each of the virtual hosts. At times, especially after pounding on the site(s) for a while, it will serve from the WRONG directory. 

Honest. WRONG directory. I didn't believe it at first.

For example, I can hit one of the virtual hosts... get the right file(s)... hit hard-refresh. Get right files. Repeat 20x. Sometimes get files from the directory of a different (wrong) virtual server. error_log confirms that Apache is trying to get files from the wrong directory.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
remove some modules... update to a later version of Apache

State-Changed-Why:

This is a problem with the SuSE distribution of
Apache.  I believe it has to do with a module
like mod_dyn_vhost that they include.  Please
contact SuSE or download Apache directly from
http://httpd.apache.org/
