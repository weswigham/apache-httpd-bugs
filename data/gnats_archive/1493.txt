Solaris 2.5.1 - fully patched with 103640-12 using gcc-2.7.2.3
>Description:
I've compiled apache-1.2.4 with no problems.  When I try to execute httpd I'm getting the following message:

# /usr/local/apache-1.2.4/src/httpd -f /usr/local/apache-1.2.4/conf/httpd.conf
Syntax error on line 49 of /usr/local/apache-1.2.4/conf/access.conf:
<Location not allowed here

I looked at your location.html and checked the bug reports.  I've matched
the entry exactly like the example shown in the location.html page.  This is
the entry in access.conf:

<Location /status>
SetHandler server-status
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from .champusa.com
</Location>

This is the only issue.  Otherwise everything else is fine.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Exactly where in access.conf are you trying to put this?
Are you sure it isn't inside another container, eg.
inside a Directory container?

 But are you sure you don't have any other containers (eg. Directory) above
 that which aren't closed before this starts?
 
 Please send a copy of your whole access.conf file.

 As I said, be sure you are closing all your Directory containers.
 You commented out the </Directory> for your cgi-bin directory.  That
 means the <Directory> that is opened is never closed.  You can't have
 Locations inside Directories, so it is invalid.
 
 Remove the comment from your </Directory> and it should work fine.

 Did you restart the server?  Do you get any errors when you try?
 
 Did you check the error log?

 Thanks.  Before I looked in the error_log file I modified httpd.conf by adding a
 user "www".  Then I created a group "www" using the same number as its PID
 (1062,1062).
 When I restarted httpd everything was fine.  When I looked in the httpd.conf
 file the group id was invalid (-1), so I changed it to 1062 before I restarted
 httpd.
 
 Everything is now up and running.  I want to thank you for your quick responses.
 
 I will definitely recommend to everyone I know to use Apache's httpd server.
 I put myself on the announcement list for any updates, etc.
 
 Thanks again.
