>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0
>Description:
Although report #2303 points out that future versions will include the
ability to run multiple instances of Apache as a service under NT by
changing the service name (-n option) I haven't seen anywhere that it
will be configurable as to what user that service runs as. I know this is
configurable manually using the NT services panel, but it would be very nice
to configure this from the Apache command line, and it isn't difficult since
the username/password fields have to be passed anyway when installing as a
service (they're currently set to NULL in the source code).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
In os/win32/service.c, function InstallService, there's a call to CreateService.
Parameters to this include the username and password of an NT user account, 
which could be passed on the command line when installing with the -i option.

I should be able to put together a patch if required.. let me know.
