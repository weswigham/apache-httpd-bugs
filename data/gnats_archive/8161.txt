Windows 2000, no service packs
cygwin toolkit
>Description:
When we attempt to run a simple CGI script, it fails no matter how the server is configured -- if apache is running as a service. if apache is started manually, the problem goes away.

And no, we're not running a production system on win2k
>How-To-Repeat:
install from the following archive:
apache_1.3.20-win32-no_src-r2.msi

compile and install the following CGI program:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("Content-type: text/html\n");
	printf("\n");
	printf("Hello World");
	return 0;
}

run apache as a service.

Invoking the cgi program via URL will fail. Apache will emit a "Premature end of script headers" message in the error log.

>Fix:
My first choice involves unspeakable acts perpetrated upon pasty-faced billionaires from Redmond, but you guys are probably too busy to make the trip. 
I suspect that the "OS service" protocol has been changed between NT4 and 2000, so perhaps there is IPC weirdness when the server tries to invoke the script, or that environment variables aren't getting passed.

I used the Cygwin toolkit to compile the above code example. Running executables compiled in this way requires that the cygwin DLL be somewhere on the path. It's possible that the service sees a different path that the one it's supposed to, but I'm just guessing.

State-Changed-Why:

Dexter, please try 1. compiling with msvc and see if that 
changes the behavior.  2. moving the cygwin binary to the
apache serverroot or the %SystemRoot%\system32\ directory,
or assure that the cygwin path is in the PATH env var for 
ALL users (you will need to reboot for this to take effect.)

The apache service runs in the context of the LocalSystem
(SYSTEM) user account.  Therefore, your path doesn't affect
the Apache service.

You already tried stopping the apache service, and ran
apache from the command line.  This often affects the way 
apps run, especially if they have any dependencies on the
GUI subsystem.  I dunno if cygwin makes some horrid
assumptions.   See...

Please report back what solved your headache.  Thanks.
