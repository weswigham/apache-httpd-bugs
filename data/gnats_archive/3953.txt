>Environment:
NT4.0 workstation  w/ sp4 on a Compaq deskpor pentium II. 
>Description:
The Apache installation on NT appears to work without a hitch.  The Install Apache as service (NT only) doesn't appear to have an effect.  Apache doesn't not come up after bootup as a service.  I can fire up Apache just fine using the start run Apache.  The window opens, Apache fires up, Apache appears in the service.

Any suggestions?

PS:  An Apache deinstallation module would be super.

 Thanks for your prompt response.  I tried using the apache -i option to no
 avail.  The path to the executable is in the appropriate part of
 HKEY_local_Machine as indicated in the installation guide.  Apache still is
 reluctant to fire up as a service.  Any other ideas about what is stopping
 the addition of the service.

 What type of error message are you getting?
 IF you can start it from the command line, did you stop
 that copy b4 you started the one from the services panel?
 
 ALso try uninstalling it as a service and then install it again and
 try again?  Please reply back with specific error messages if possible.
 Thanks
 Shane
