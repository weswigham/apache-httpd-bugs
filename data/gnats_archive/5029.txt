>Description:
I am running 1.3.4 on this machine and it compiled just fine.  Here is what happens when i try to compile on LinuxPPC R4:

[root@beholder apache_1.3.9]# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/etc/apache

>How-To-Repeat:
Any LinuxPPC R4 system with the original software should be able to duplicate it.
>Fix:
I'd be happy to help debug the problem if given some direction.
