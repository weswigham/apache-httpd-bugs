Can you log into the webserver and double check that it resolves
www.sbc.org.uk as 193.243.233.97?  The behaviour you describe is exactly
what would happen if you've got an error on the webserver itself -- such
as an /etc/hosts entry, or a bogus NIS entry.

The most reliable way to test this is to log into the webserver and then
attempt to telnet to www.sbc.org.uk, and see what IP address telnet tries. 
I suggest this rather than other things such as nslookup because nslookup
doesn't always use the same resolver as normal programs.
