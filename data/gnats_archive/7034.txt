apache
>Environment:
PIII 800Mhz machine running OpenStep Mach 4.2: Tue Jan 26 11:21:50 PST 1999; root(rcbuilder):Objects/mk-183.34.4.obj~2/RELEASE_I386

gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Browsers intermittently receive only part of the intended output from Perl CGI scripts, but sometimes script completes and page is delivered in full.

This is apparently the same as http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/3918, which apparently has not been fixed. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Demo can be arranged if desired but for now we have reverted to Apache 1.2.6 because server must keep running scripts.
>Fix:
Provide a way to restore 1.2.x style buffering when compiling Apache?
