>Description:
If you create multiline entries in servlet.properties like so

servlet.Hello.initArgs=\
msg="Hello there", \
who="who are you?"

the init args dont appear to reach the servlet correctly.

Removing the backslashes and creating a long line works.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add the following init method to Hello.java:
public void init(ServletConfig config)
    throws ServletException {
    super.init(config);
        
    msg = getInitParameter("message");
}
//and declare msg 
    String msg = null;

Now in servlets.properties (or the appropriate properties file 
add 
servlet.Hello.initArgs=\
msg="Hello"

Add an appropriate line to method doGet to output the msg

State-Changed-Why:
yep, looks like a bug...looking through the code, it appears as though you need at least one argument on the line first...ie:

servlet.Hello.initArgs=msg="Hello there", \
who="who are you?"

that should work.
