AIX rs6k 2 3 000087724600

AIX 3.2.5 with native C compiler 	
>Description:
I have compilation problems. CC can't find one iclude file and two identifiers. 
I also wasn't able to guess what value must be for those identifiers. I run configure 
using this command :

bash# CC=cc ./configure --prefix=/local/apache --exec-prefix=/local/apache

After make I got this response :

===> src/main
cc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include   -DAIX -DNEED_RLIM_T -U__STR__ -DUSE_HSREGEX `../apaci`  http_main.c

"http_main.c", line 3540.8: 1506-045 (S) Undeclared identifier PROCESSOR_CLASS_ANY.

The latest CVS tree now only does this if the AIX version

problem.
