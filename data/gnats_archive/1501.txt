State-Changed-Why:
If you are using the binary (precompiled) version of Apache,
then this bug is not fixed. However that patch in
PR#1030 is correct and fixes the problem, and is part
of the source code of 1.3b3 and will be in the binary of
1.3b4.

[From #1503, erroneously submitted as an additional PR]
As advised in #1501, we rebuilt from source, first verifying that
util_script.c does indeed include the change from PR #1030, which it
does (we changed no source). We installed the rebuilt exe and dll, 
started things back up, and saw no different behaviour from the 
prebuilt 1.3b3 binary: the #1030 problem still affects us.

"Windows! Windows! Windows!" chanted the weird guy at the front.
It wasn't clear at all why we were supposed to be chanting "Windows",
but followed along.  They were feeding us afterall.
