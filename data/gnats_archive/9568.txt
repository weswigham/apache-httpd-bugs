>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Suse Linux 7.3 Kernel 2.4.16-20011220
Apache-rpm from Suse 7.3 (including mod_ssl and mod_perl).
mod_ssl/2.8.4 OpenSSL/0.9.6b mod_perl/1.26 mod_gzip/1.3.19.1a
>Description:
We have a high-traffic-server here (6000 visitors/day) and one week ago I needed to reinstall this server. I used the latest components (rpms) available @ Suse (see Environment).

But under normal load, Apache produces every 1 or 2 hours a child-process who doesn't die. With "top" and "apachectl fullstatus" I was able to catch some information (see below). At first I thought that the problem may be the PHP-lib but there are also other childs who doesn't die (.gif-files for example!!). Sometimes one of these childs eats up all CPU resources. One day there were 5 processes who eat up all CPU-time (this was severe!!)!
Then I thought the problem is in mod_gzip and I deactivated it, but after some hours there was again one non-dying child (82,2% of CPU!).

I can make a "killall -HUP httpd" to fix the problem for a short time. There is nothing suspicious in the error_log.

Here is the information of 4 of these processes (sorry, I was not able to catch some info from a "CPU-time eating child" - I will send it later when I was able to catch the info):

I cannot reproduce the problem because it seems to happen randomly.
Thanks for your help and support!

 Addition:
 I deactivated again mod_gzip and now also PHP4 and mod_ssl to make sure 
 it's not a problem of these modules.
 Now it takes a little bit longer but there are also non-dying childs 
 after some time (sometimes, as I said before, with heavy CPU load). This 
 brings me to the opinion that the problem is in Apache.
 
 But I could get some more information:
 I looked at "top" and suddenly there were 12 childs who don't die 
 anymore - all of them were created approx. at the same time! After that 
 (1 or 2 seconds later), all was normal again (besides of the 12 
 non-dying childs).
 Maybe this will help you to find the bug. At least I hope so, because 
 our server needs quick help.
 
 Thanks again for your support and help.

 Addition 2:
 This problem is severe!
 To have a quick fix for the problem, I call "apachectl graceful" from a 
 hourly cron-job. Before that I send me a mail with current "top".
 
 Currently, there are approx. 20-30 non-dying childs - at and of every 
 hour! When cron does the "apachectl graceful", there is a significant 
 time-delay in accessing apache (5-15 seconds). The non-dying childs are 
 marked "<defunct>" and then they die (finally).
 
 Is there something I can do? Should I down- or upgrade Apache? Can I 
 provide more information about this bug for you? The problem also 
 happens when I disable all the non-standard-Apache-Modules (like PHP4 
 and mod_ssl). HELP!
