SunOS saarland 5.5.1 Generic_103640-05 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20      
>Description:
We are running several Apache on several ports != 80. All Apache are
running PHP/FI 2.12. phpInfo() show all Apache defined variables. For a server
running on port 2010 it show:

SCRIPT_URI = http://saarland.sz-sb.de:2010:2010/test.phtml

Why is the port number shown twice ? Maybe it's a problem of PHP but I could
not find any buggy code inside the PHP sources.

If it is something that only appears in PHP, we really
can't support it.

What happens if you call a CGI-script like printenv?  Does
it have the correct SCRIPT_URI?  If so, this really looks
like a problem in PHP.

 I took again a look at the problem. SCRIPT_URI is declared
 in mod_rewrite. PHP/FI does no processing of the Apache variables.
 However I could not reproduce the problem under Linux, but
 under Irix and Solaris both with Apache 1.24.
 
 Bye,
