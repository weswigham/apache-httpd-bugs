Redhat 7.0, glibc-2.2
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)

>Description:
apache is compiled with
EXTRA_LIBS=-lgdbm, EXTRA_INCLUDES=-I/usr/include/gdbm
to get mod_rewrite compiled correctly with dbm support.

i used makemap and the .db generation perl script from the server docs (mod_rewrite) to generate the db files. both produce the same.

the use of dbm fails with this output into the rewrite log:
[*/sid#812965c][rid#813fcdc/initial] (6) cache lookup FAILED, forcing new map lookup
[*/sid#812965c][rid#813fcdc/initial] (5) map lookup FAILED: map=vhost[dbm] key=www.example.com
[*/sid#812965c][rid#813fcdc/initial] (4) RewriteCond: input='' pattern='^/(.*)$' => not-matched

So, i don't really know, why this does not work at all. It works fine with the text version, but fails with dbm.
>How-To-Repeat:
RedHat 7 base system, apache 1.3.20
compile, install, use dbm: maps in mod_rewrite...
