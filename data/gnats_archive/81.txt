>Description:
Hi, I have two enhancement requests for suexec.
First, the cgi-bin directory has to be hard-coded into suexec. This
means that only one cgi-bin can be used with one server process
(plus the users_dirs). However, with virtual servers, we want to have
one cgi_bin per virtual server. This is currently not possible with
suexec.
Second, I'd like to be able to execute the cgi-bin chrooted. It should
be fairly easy to enhance suexec to allow one more argument, the root directory.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add a new configuration parameter, CGIChrootDirectory, which is passed
to suexec. In suexec, check its validity and do a chroot first

State-Changed-Why:
The cgi-bin directory does not have to be hardcoded,
just the DOC_ROOT.  If all the CGIs are under one
tree, it is no problem.  The cgi-bin dir for ~user requests
in user home directory requests.  We don't really want
to add this complexity to suexec right now.

The chroot request presents some problems because it really
requires parsing the config files, to be secure, and that
isn't a nice thing for suexec to do.  suexec is written
with the assumption that someone can compromise the httpd
user and run suexec with whatever command line args they
want.  This really fits in more as a local addition.

We need to be very careful with suexec.  The potential
for misuse is large, so the less configurable it is the
better.  It is intended that anyone with specific 
local requirements modify it to suit them.  

In the future, after 1.2, we may consider adding more 
functionality once it has been proven to work.
