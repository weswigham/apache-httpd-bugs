>Description:
Allow `Alias` directive in .htaccess config file.  Currently Alias is only allowable
in the server config files.  Would be much easier if the user could control this directive.

Originally I thought that a simple symbolic link (ln -s), would solve this problem
however, then it only reads the htaccess file of the SOURCE of the symbolic link
and ignores the DESTINATION htaccess file which is what would be disired.

State-Changed-Why:
Submitter gave bogus return address.

In any event, .htaccess is read in the destination of a symlink, provided
you have configured AllowOverride appropriately -- for the destination.

Comment-Added:
(corrected bogus return address by using address from
 PR#1855)

To repeat Dean's previous comment: .htaccess files
are read in the destination of a symlink (unless
disabled via AllowOverride).

 Are you sure "AllowOverride" is set for the correct directory
 and there are no other "AllowOverride" entries that override the
 "All" setting?
 
 On what platform do you use Apache?

 No it won't read the destination's parent directories.  It does read the
 destination's .htaccess however.  There's a note somewhere in the docs
 explaining that when apache does traverse a symlink it *does not* rewrite
 the filename -- so if /foo/bar is a symlink to /do/wah/ditty, and a
 reference to /foo/bar/blah is made, then apache looks for rules covering
 /foo/bar/blah, NOT /do/wah/ditty/blah.
 
 Using 1.2.6 or 1.3b6-dev (which should be the same as all the released
 versions in this respect) I was not able to verify your bug.  For example,
 I did this:
 
 cd ap/htdocs
 ln -s ~/public_html dg
 cd dg
 echo "Header add testing this" > .htaccess
 
 start httpd
 
 % telnet localhost 8080
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 Connected to localhost.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 HEAD /dg/ HTTP/1.0
 
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 Date: Mon, 23 Feb 1998 01:01:46 GMT
 Server: Apache/1.3b6-dev
 testing: this
 Connection: close
 Content-Type: text/html
 
 Connection closed by foreign host.
 
 note the "testing: this" header.  The .htaccess file of the destination
 was read and processed.

 Aaaaah, your first paragraph will explain my dilema.  Case closed.  Thanks
 for the info and sorry for the inconvenience.
