>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
I am using the precompiled version of Apache for Win32 on an NT 4.0 machine.
>Description:
When following the instructions on http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html for
starting Apache as a Windows Service, it seems that it does not accept the
-n argument for giving the name of the service. It works fine if the -n
parameter is omitted (defaulting to service name "apache").
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to use the -n parameter as explained on http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html.
>Fix:
Probably a simple change. Most likely when the precompiled version of Apache
was made, someone forgot to make sure this code was compiled in (I'm assuming
the code exists, since its effects are documented; if not, it should be
simple code to write and if I had a compiler, I'd do it).
