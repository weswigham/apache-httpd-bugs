SunOS kepler 5.4 Generic_101945-49 sun4m sparc
>Description:
When the following:
-------------------------------
<script language="JavaScript">
<!--hide script from old browsers
document.write("<center>This document was last modified on: " + document.lastModified + "</center>");
// end hiding -->
</script>
-------------------------------
is coded into HEADER.html, the output is as follows:
-------------------------------
This document was last modified on: Wed Dec 31 18:00:00 1969
-------------------------------
I believe this to be because of the dynamic adding of the directory listing.
Shouldn't the time resolve to the last time HEADER.html was modified - if not,
then to the current time that document was called?

I realize the wrong time is GMT+6hours, which is our time zone.  This tells me
that the javascript is either NULLing out or getting zero returned.

When HEADER.html is renamed to index.html, the output is correct.  I am using
two versions of Netscape, both have the same results.
>How-To-Repeat:
Generate two identical html files, each containing the javascript code.  Name
one file index.html, and the other file HEADER.html.  View the files through the
browser.
>Fix:
No.  My guess is that time_t (setting UNIX seconds) is erroring out

State-Changed-Why:
This is a javascript problem not an apache problem.  It's likely
because dynamically generated content (such as directory indexes
and server parsed html) do *not* include Last-Modified headers.
So you're probably supposed to check for the existance of that header
before using that variable.
