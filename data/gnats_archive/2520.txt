>Environment:
Linux v2.0.34, on a P133
>Description:
When I run apachectl start, it reports that httpd cannot be found. I editted the script
and changed the error messages it echos until I found which one it was triggering, and
it reported that httpd could not be found. However, httpd does exist, and in the
directory that it is pointing to. I even went so far as to replace $HTTPD with the
full path, and it still gives the error.
