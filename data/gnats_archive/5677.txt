>Description:
mod_mime returned sucess for type_checker, even when it has not established a character set. This stops the chain of calls to type_checker, of course.

For text/ types, it is very possible that another module (like mod_mime_magic) may know the content encoding (by examining the contents) when mod_mime has no idea based on filename. It seems that there should be some way to allow different modules to contribute content_type and content_encoding. Otherwise, the only solution here would be to modify mod_mime to duplicate mod_mime_magic in opening the file and looking for Unicode BOM's.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
treat type_checker as a run_all, or special case it to only stop when both fields are established, or make a new slot (yuck) for a separate method to do the encoding part.

 I messed up the terminology in the original bug report. The problem is, in
 fact, worse than I had originally thought. The problem is not content_type
 versus content_encoding. The problem is the content type without the
 charset= and the charset= specification. The current modularity makes it
 essentially impossible for one module to say "text/plain" and another to say
 ";charset=UTF-8" or whatever.
