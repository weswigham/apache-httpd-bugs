>Description:
Cant get that far, got to get it to compile first.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow INSTALL instructions, activate usertrack module (though not required
to show bug) try to compile.   Compile failes because one cannot compile the
incomplete Spencer regex library that is apparantly required.

Either that or the configuration script wrongfully makes the partial spencer
library required.
>Fix:
Include the _complete_ Spencer regex library, verify it does in fact compile
on supported platforms, especially the well known and popular ones, or 
include information/URLs from where to obtain the needed library. 

- or -

design the code to use the BSD type regex routines (re_comp, etc),
or the SysV-ish regexp routines (via regexp.h).

This problem did not occur on prev versions, incl 1.1.1

It would certainly help if you gave us the errors you
were having instead of just going on complaining about
how it doesn't work without saying exactly what doesn't work.

It compiles perfectly on SunOS 4.x for me, so I'm not sure
how I'm magically supposed to know your problem without
you giving any details.

Thanks.

 Subject: Re: os-sunos/911: Included Spencer regex package wont compile (undefined macros)
 
 I didnt give a lot of details because there wasn't a lot of room to
 give much in that little form.
 
 Very simply - the regex pkg failed to compile.  Everything is stock,
 save the compiler, which is gcc.  I tried a make r in the regex subdir
 to verify the lib, and that is where it blew up.  I tried it set up
 for gcc and for stock Sun cc.
 
 I contacted Spencer and got the ftp site for the original unaltered
 version, which after running mkh by hand (makefile did not run it), the
 orignal version compiled after I made a define for _POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX.
 
 After once getting thru these bugs and successfully compiling the pkg,
 then it will recompile if a change is made and its re-built.  But its
 sure a snag if any errors occur - without a make clean, starting from
 scratch it fails to build.
 
 The problem appears to be in the creation of the .ih files - mkh is not
 run consistantly via the Makefile.  ESPECIALLY if a config error causes
 the first compile attempt to not complete.  Then after the config is
 fixed, it does not pick up the rest of the generated header files (one
 .ih file present from aborted build  and the build restarted).
 
 You get a message like 'don't know how to make engine.ih' - this msg
 appears for each file.  Manually running mkh resulted in headers that
 weren't right- and BOH, etc errored as not defined - that part was my fault
 (I forgot the -p flag) but after re-running mkh it finally compiled so
 the build of the package itself could proceed.  I think more explicit
 dependencies are required - perhaps a depend rule and a make depend
 might help.  I might try that.
 
 Other than that, I haven't determined why it behaves like this yet.
 Not sure if it is mods in the regex pkg or not.  I have not run across
 a thing quite like this before...

 PS - when you extract the tar archive, it gives a checksum error.

 Are you saying you didn't just follow the instructions, but you started
 trying to make the regex library seperately?  That is the sort of thing
 that you really need to mention.  I can't magically know what you are
 doing.  If you have to do that before the problem occurs, you need to say
 so.
 
 Guesses at what causes the problem is are fine, but first I need to know
 what the exact problem is.

 You lost me.  What is this with?  The regex library distributed with
 Apache, or are you going on trying to use the original regex library?  A
 "config error" where?
 
 [...]

 What is "it"?  Again, we love to fix bugs but we can not do so based on a
 description of them unless you provide an exact fix; we need the actual
 output from the actual attempt.
 
 Please unpack a fresh Apache distribution and send me a log of everything
 you do.  First try, just unpack it, run Configure and type make in the src
 directory.

 <sigh>
 
 I went thru what happened allready.  I really see no need repeat what
 was said.  The package does not like to let one build the test/debug
 version of the regex package, as modified in the tarball.  Originally
 the Spencer regex pkg could be built with either a K&R cc or an ANSI cc
 with the appropriate flags in the makefile.  It was modified to not do
 that, after I did some diffs.
 
 I finally got the thing to build as I allready indicated, after seeing
 what changes were made by comparing the original with the regex included,
 and dealing with those changes.
 
 You people included a package that is meant to be a standalone library
 in its own right, left the standalone build makefile and instructions
 in there, but modified the package, said nothing about doing that,
 which caused it to not compile as originally intended.  That resulted
 in the problems and a lot of confusion.  There is a problem in the
 makefile in that package that is apparantly sensitive to this,nd that
 causes the generated headers to not build correctly, and the compile to
 fail.
 
 I also mentioned in a PS that the tarball does give a checksum error
 that was also the source of some concern here when extracted as the msg
 produced is what one sees on a truncated tar file.  This applies to
 the .Z form and the .gz form (ftping several times from several sites
 to determine if it was a bad ftp copy or was in fact in the original
 archive).  I don't know if anything important is truncated off the
 archive or not as of yet, it appears to lop off at the ./log subdir,
 and whatever followed that.
 
 What is there does build after what I experienced and described, but I
 dont know if its a good build yet, there are some site-specific things
 that need to be done here before its actually run.
 
 Now you can check into what I described, add the appropriate docs, or
 just cop an attitude, I really don't care.  I have consumed more of my
 time than this issue is worth (to me, at least).
 
 I tried to share some info with you about a problem I had with the
 package, that others may also run into, as well, if conditions are
 right, but I guess you are not interested in info about glitches unless
 you can replicate them under ANY condition, with no investigative
 effort involved.

 You never answered critical questions such as "what exactly are the
 error messages?"  i.e. how about cutting and pasting them so that we
 can read them exactly, rather than your interpretation of them?

 If you want a test/debug version of a regex package then get and
 install Spencer's original tarball, then use "Rule WANTHSREGEX=no"
 in your Configuration and apache will oblige by using your installed
 regex library.  You'll probably have to also add -lregex to EXTRA_LFLAGS
 or something, I don't know.  We don't pretend to support all possible
 configurations.

 Apache does not build with a K&R C compiler, there is no reason for us to
 continue to support K&R compilation of the regex library.

 Out of the box, apache builds on SunOS 4.1.4.  There is absolutely no
 reason for you to play in the regex directory.  That is why we don't
 document anything about the regex directory.  You got yourself into this
 problem by not following the installation instructions. 
 
 The regex directly is mostly the original Spencer stuff because we see
 no reason to remove things.  If you follow the installation instructions
 you will never venture into this directory, and you'll never be confused
 by the existance of files we don't document.

 This is a common problem when tar is reading from a gzip or compress
 pipe.  It is almost never a problem in the tar file... and in this case
 unless your download of the tar file messed up, then I wouldn't worry
 about this error.

 Remember the price tag you paid for this product.  If you have a system
 you wish to donate to us so that we have more systems to test on, then
 please say so.  Otherwise it is *you* the *user* that must do the legwork
 for us.  We have absolutely no idea how your system is configured.  And
 if you don't answer basic questions like, "what are the exact error
 messages it generates?" then what are we supposed to do?  Go out and buy
 an old sparc, buy sunos 4.1.whatever, install it, and magically try to
 replicate your environment?
 
 Thanks for choosing Apache.
