ansi C
>Description:
* The standard mod_proxy just does not understand http://user:password@host/
requests and refuses to handle them.
* the proxy module logs the sent user/password pairs in the logfile => security
problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just use Netscape Gold and give it a default user/password pair then publish
your document through the proxy. Netscape will send something like
  PUT http://user:password@host/document HTTP/1.0
which gets the proxy confused.
>Fix:
I have fixed the problems by modifying proxy_http.c and mod_proxy.c -- where
can I send the solution %3
