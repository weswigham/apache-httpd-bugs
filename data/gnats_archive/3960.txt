OS: Solaris 2.6 
Machine: Ultra-2
Compiler: gcc version egcs-2.91.60
>Description:
I have recently upgraded my webserver from Apache 1.3.1 to 1.3.4 and now CGI
no longer works properly.
Both cgiwrap and POST operations in cgi-scripts gives me a 'Forbidden' error-message.

I have used exactly the same permissions as I did in 1.3.1, and those worked fine.
Is there something new in this release which demands a different setup?


The difference is that I now have moved the server to a virtual domain.
The config-file for this server looks like this:
<VirtualHost 129.177.16.249>
   ServerAdmin webmaster@ii.uib.no
   DocumentRoot /export/www/htdocs/ii
   ServerName www.ii.uib.no
   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /export/www/cgi-bin/
   ErrorLog /export/www/logs/ii_error_log
   TransferLog /export/www/logs/ii_access_log
   UserDir public_html
</VirtualHost>

I can't see anything here that restricts my permissions
(or have I turned blind?)

I even set the cgi-bin permissions to:
<Directory "/export/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride All
    Options All
</Directory>
...without any luck
>How-To-Repeat:
POST operations:
http://www.ii.uib.no/~rossebo/div/tilbakemelding.html  returns 'Forbidden'.

CGIwrap problem:
http://www.ii.uib.no/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/kjartan/cookie.cgi  returns 'Forbidden'.

http://www.ii.uib.no/~kjartan/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi  works fine.
>Fix:
Go back to 1.3.1 ?

 I just found the problem, so please disregard my bug report.
 
 The problem was that the UID of cgiwrap and httpd didn't match.
