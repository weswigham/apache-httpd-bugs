UNAME=SunOS 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2 /  GCC 2.8.1 &
 required libraries
>Description:
I've been using the prepackaged binary from smc.vnet.net, but have task to include
Java servlets from JDK into Apache, so I have to get Apache to compile first.

Tried compiling APACHE1.2.6 wih latest GCC.  Configure worked fine, 'make'
 failed in alloc.c(pstrcat)/(builtin_va_alist)...first declared, etc...

tried Apache 1.3.2 with same GCC.  Configure worked fine, 'make' failed in
ap_snprintf.c (builtin_va_alist) undeclared......

State-Changed-When: Tue Oct  6 10:34:55 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
You are not using the proper version of gcc; you are likely
using a Solaris 2.5.x gcc.  gcc is specific to the version
of Solaris you are using, and you must use one designed for
your exact version.
