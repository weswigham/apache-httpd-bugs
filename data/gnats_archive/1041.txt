Meanwhile at consolle i read the message : 
INIT : Command is respawning too rapdidly ...

State-Changed-Why:

First I highly recommend that you upgrade from Apache 1.1.3
to a current version (1.2.4).
I can't see an Apache bug in your report, but a problem
with your cgi script.
Please check your script again (use the ScriptLog directive
to get a more detailed failure report for your cgi script).
