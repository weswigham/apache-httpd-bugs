>Description:
When a browser requests an AddHandler-handled file (.cgi, .shtml), and the
user or the web page they're coming from has erroneously added a trailing
slash and possibly other characters, an error 404 is *not* generated. The
page is passed to the browser as if the trailing slash and anything beyond
it didn't exist. This means that any relative links on the page stop
working.

Example:

http://www.acusd.edu/ac/classes/sched.shtml/
http://www.acusd.edu/ac/classes/sched.shtml/blahblahblah

will serve the sched.shtml page, working almost fine: except that the
locally-stored image does not load, because the browser (correctly)
requests an image in the ".../sched.shtml/" directory--which of course
doesn't exist. And any local links simply come right back to the
sched.shtml page.

Another server I use that runs Apache 1.2b11 also exhibits this behavior.

As you were already told on comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
when you posted this there, that is the proper and expected
behaviour.  The PATH_INFO environment varible contains
this extra info and it is commonly used to allow one script
or document to do multiple things or do things based on
parameters.

 I was told no such thing on ciwsu; I was told that this bug could be=
  compensated for by adding extra code to my html pages. If the team can't=
  fix it, that's fine. I'll hack it. But to claim that it is not a bug is=
  utterly silly. It is neither proper nor expected for http://hostname/item1/=
 item2/item3 to return http://hostname/item1/ especially for .shtml files.

 I'm sorry, but you're absolutely wrong.  It makes a lot of sense
 for both parsed HTML and CGI scripts; anything following the
 name of the file itself in the URL is made available to the
 parsed HTML or CGI script through the environment variable
 PATH_INFO.  Your claim that this is silly would seem to indicate
 that you think that http://hostname/item1?abc should also return
 a 404 if there's no 'item1.shtml?abc' file.  Either claim
 indicates that you should study a little more closely how URLs
 work and are defined to work.  It really is a feature, not a bug.
 
 If it's not broken -- and this is not -- then there's nothing
 to fix.  And all you'll accomplish by 'hacking it' is getting
 yourself out of step with how things work on the rest of the
 Internet.
 
 Please check the bugdb for related reports (search for
 "path_info"), check out the URL RFC 2396, and the current
 CGI draft at
