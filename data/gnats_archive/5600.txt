 Hi,
 
        Apache keeps Java Server Pages in the memory.
 But it doesn't keep other pages such as html pages,
 servlet pages, cgi pages in the memory.
 
        To clear the served jsp pages from the memory,
 you have to restart the Apache Server by invoking the
 following command.
        
        kill -HUP `cat httpd.pid`.
