The command line 'apache -k shutdown' does *not* work.
The following message is given:

[Fri Jul 02 21:47:20 1999] [emerg] (123)The filename, directory name, or volume
lable syntax is incorrect: OpenEvent on ap-671447_shutdown event

>How-To-Repeat:
On W98/95 OS running Apache 1.3.6, issue the command line:

'apache -k shutdown'
>Fix:
None.

State-Changed-From-To: open-feedback
State-Changed-By: stoddard
State-Changed-When: Fri Jul 23 08:03:46 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
Apache uses the file httpd.pid in the logs subdirectory to intuit
the shutdown event name. If you nuke this file by mistake, 
apache -k shutdown will not work (will fail with the message
you are seeing).

Please let me know if that's the problem.

 Could not resolve issue, -k shutdown still failed
 regardless of .pid file's presence or not.
 
 Now running Apache 1.3.9 on NT, so net start and
 net stop are used.
