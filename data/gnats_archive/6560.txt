The error log has entries such as

[error] (17)File exists: proxy: error linking cache file 
/here/proxy/tmpaxxxxx to /here/proxy/0/_/xxxxxxxx

like stated in PR 3558. This still seems to happen with Apache 1.3.12 on
Solaris :-(

State-Changed-Why:
I'm closing this bug report because, as you say, it is a
duplicate of #3558. Please add your comments to that report.
In particular it would be interesting to see the output
of `mount` and/or `df -ki` on your web server.
