>Organization:
>Environment:
Novell Netware 5.0, binary dist. from apache.org.
>Description:
on line 263 in mod_userdir.c is this condition:
  if (userdir[0] == '\0' || ap_os_is_path_absolute(userdir)) 
but at this moment string in userdir can't contain absolute path in Netware !

I have test user POLI with home dir sys:/home/poli[/public.www]
and my url is http://nwserver/~poli and now I prepare in the httpd.conf the next
configurations of UserDir:
1.
  UserDir sys:/home/*/public.www
  answer: Not Found 
          The requested URL /~poli was not found on this server.

2. 
  UserDir sys:/home/*
  answer: Not Found
          The requested URL /sys:/home/poli was not found on this server.

3. 
  UserDir /home/*
  answer: Not Found
          The requested URL /~poli was not found on this server.

4. UserDir sys:/home/*/public.www/:/
   answer: Not Found
           The requested URL /sys:/home/poli/public.www/:/ was not found on this server. 

5.
  UserDir sys:/home/*/:/
  answer: Request-URI Too Large
          The requested URL's length exceeds the capacity limit for this server.
          request failed: URI too long

6.
  UserDir public.www
  Alias ~poli sys:/home/poli/public.www
  answer: OK .... work fine
  
You can see, that in case 2 and 4 is condition on line 263 true, but created path is 
not found on server. In case 4 is UserDir in bad format, but contains string :/, 
because absolute path in netware is tested as strstr( path, ":/" ). It is only 
for testing purpose.
Case 5 is condition probably true too, but create infinite loop. UserDir is bad here,
is created only for testing. It is not real path in netware.

Unknown problem is in case 2., where create path /sys:/home/poli can't be found.
alias ~poli sys:/home/poli/public.www work fine. Maybe the slash on the begin.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try examples above.
>Fix:
Here is three source line from mod_userdir.c
        if (strchr(userdir, '*'))
            x = ap_getword(r->pool, &userdir, '*');
        if (userdir[0] == '\0' || ap_os_is_path_absolute(userdir)) {
 
On netware can't be absolute path tested, because on line above can 
be userdir modified. and created path can't contains / on the begin.

I have't compiler for netware to test it. Please send me contact, who ported apache for
netware to help solve this problem.

  thanks
