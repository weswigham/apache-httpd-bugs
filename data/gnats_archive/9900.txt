Hi!

We have a problem with Apache on OSF1 V5.1 alpha together with ScriptAliasMatch

The config is like this:

ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at|ch|de|es|fr|it|pl|uk)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi8-$1-$2
ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at|ch|de|es|fr|it|pl)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi7-$1-$2
ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at|ch|de|es|fr|it)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi6-$1-$2
ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at|ch|de|es|fr)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi5-$1-$2
ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at|ch|de|es)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi4-$1-$2
ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at|ch|de)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi3-$1-$2
ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at|ch)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi2-$1-$2
ScriptAliasMatch   /m/(at)/a(.*)  /tmp/my.fcgi1-$1-$2

and a request on this host gives the following log and error-message:

Logfile:
192.168.1.47 - - [21/Feb/2002:16:13:35 +0100] "GET /m/at/a HTTP/1.0" 404 306

Error File:
[Thu Feb 21 16:13:35 2002] [error] [client 192.168.1.47] script not found or 
unable to stat: /tmp/my.fcgi4-at-

OK, the cgi-script does not exist, but another error-message
is expected: the missing file should be another, as it fits the top regexp:
[Thu Feb 21 16:13:35 2002] [error] [client 192.168.1.47] script not found or 
unable to stat: /tmp/my.fcgi8-at-

On a Linux RedHead 7.2 the Config works fine, so I suspect the regexp library!

I have had a look at the source code and can find src/regexp -
is this one used, or the system library? How can I switch?

Apache is configured as follows:
./configure \
"--with-layout=Apache" \
"--prefix=/opt/ucp/apache/1.3.23-2.2.12-1" \
"--sysconfdir=/etc/httpd" \
"--localstatedir=/var/ucp/apache" \
"--enable-module=rewrite" \
"--enable-module=mmap_static" \
"--enable-module=alias" \
"--enable-module=expires" \
"--enable-module=vhost_alias" \
"--enable-module=headers" \
"--enable-module=asis" \
"--enable-module=info"\
"--activate-module=src/modules/fastcgi/libfastcgi.a" \

So the regexp library in src/regexp should be used!
(while compiling -DHSREGEX shows up - as far as I can remember)

Any ideas?

Ciao,
