All
>Description:

HTTP/1.1 says that we should be sending Vary: field-name
whenever a request-header field affects the selection of
a resource.  We are not doing so for Host-based virtual hosts.

This problem will only affect server-side caches (like Harvest)
which currently do not understand Vary in any case.  Nevertheless,
it should be fixed before 1.2 final.
>How-To-Repeat:

Do the following via telnet dev.apache.org 80
 
    HEAD /home.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: dev.apache.org
 
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 02 Dec 1996 18:12:48 GMT
    Server: Apache/1.2b0

    ETag: "75393-6ea-30aecfed"
 
we should be sending Vary: Host if the virtual host server-path
influenced the entity selected.
>Fix:
It should be set wherever ServerPath is internally redirected

State-Changed-Why:
Both Dean and Alexei say this was decided to be a
non-issue, even by Roy (who submitted it).  I'm
closing it 'cuz I wasted time on it and don't want
it to waste anyone else's.
