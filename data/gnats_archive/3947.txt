State-Changed-Why:
another of these pending reports that is supposed to be attached
to some other PR... ah well...

btw I can't reproduce the problem on solaris 2.6.  I suspect
it's one of the solaris swap bugs.  Try "swap -s" some time.

>Unformatted:
I have found a few other interesting items here (as well as other
reports of the same problem, none with a solution yet.)

I have turned off keepalive.  I can telnet to port 80 and let the
connection hang (not type anything), and it will... indefinitely.  On
another (working, Linux) machine, the connection is appropriately closed
upon reaching the timeout of 300 seconds.  For some reason, Solaris
appears to be ignoring the timeout value.  This is what I believe to be
the problem, and it appears to be replicable at least on my Sun machine
via telenet session.

My theory is that connections are made to httpd, yet they get hosed (net
congestion, browser timeout, etc) before the client can make a request
(like GET /).  Solaris/Apache will then just listen indefinitely without
closing the connection upon reaching the timeout value.  On some of
these "labotomized" children, I can do a kill -PIPE <PID> and get
success, others are less cooperative and require a kill -9 <PID>   I
have noted that these more stubborn children are the ones that have been
around for quite some time (well over 5000 seconds).

Hope this info helps.
