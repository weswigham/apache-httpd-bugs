>Description:
Running php scripts linked to a mysql database is no problem for me running localhost, but when one tries to access the computer from another one you get to see the top of the document for a second, and then an error message.. The same thing happened to me with a cgi program on another computer. It feels like the server doesn't keep track with the script when it's longish..
