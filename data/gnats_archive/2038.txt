>Environment:
WinNT 4.0, VC5
>Description:
There is a bug in sub_canonical_filename in that it cannot cope with
pathnames which begin with '\\' being passed to it.

>How-To-Repeat:
Set the UserDir to //foo/bar/*/public_html and attempt to access a
~ directory.
>Fix:
At line 30 of util_win32.c: 

   if (szFilePart < buf+3) {
        strcpy(szCanon, buf);
// New stuff
	if(szCanon[0]=='\\' && szCanon[1]=='\\')
		szCanon[0]=szCanon[1]='/'; 
	else
// End new stuff
		szCanon[2] = '/';
        return;
    }
