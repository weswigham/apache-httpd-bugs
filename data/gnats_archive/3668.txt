>Description:
I am trying to install apache_1.3.4 on an HP unix box running 11.0.

I type in "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache" and it seems to work OK.

I type in "make" and get the followin error:

===> src
===> src/regex
<=== src/regex
===> src/os/unix
	cc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DHPUX11 -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -
DUSE_HSREGEX `../../apaci` os.c
cc: "/usr/include/dlfcn.h", line 17: error 1681: Must use +e or -Ae for long
long in ANSI mode.
cc: "os.c", line 110: warning 611: Qualifiers are not asignment-compatible.
cc: "os.c", line 110: warning 563: Argument #1 is nto the correct type.

*** Error exit code 1
Stop.

Is there a way to resolve this so I can continue with my install????

Thanks,

Don don.bara@hallwood-petroleum.com

Yeah you can do something like:

env CFLAGS="-Ae" ./configure
