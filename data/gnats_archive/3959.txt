>Organization:
>Environment:
Apache version 1.3.4 on a pc architecture intel pentium II 400. 128 megs ram, 
10 gigs ultra scsi drives, linux 2.2.1 SMP, gcc 2.7.2.3 based on a 
slackware 3.6 installation.
>Description:
This server is our main web server, serving hundreds of virtual hosts all 
logging to one log file. The server may get thousands of hits a minute. A theroy 
could be that the the server is racing to keep writing to the common log file 
and getting confused once and a while. This does not cause the server to crash or
performance to degrade (as far as i can tell) but it does make running stats 
very difficult. The date and time fields are supposed to use a colon (":") as a 
seperator, but this may dissapear and turn the date into "1999822".

Example:

1cust153.tnt8.beaverton.or.da.uu.net - - [09/Feb/1999822:59:56 -0500] "GET /img1
4.gif HTTP/1.1" 200 985 "http://arizonahomes1.com/" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MS
IE 4.01; Windows 98)"

>How-To-Repeat:
An example log file or example entries can be supplied.
>Fix:
No.

So much has changed in the win32 port, I cannot imagine this
is still an open issue.  Assuming report is resolved.
