>Environment:
AIX 4.3.1
uname -a => AIX carrot 3 4 0054452A4C00
compiler => gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
>Description:
I configured and built Apache 1.3.9 on AIX 4.3 using:
./configure \
  --prefix=/w1/local/apache_1.3.9 \
  --sbindir=/w1/local/apache_1.3.9/sbin \
  --enable-module=most \
  --enable-shared=max
There were no errors generated during compile.

When I try and run it though I get a "bad magic" error.  For example:
> cd /w1/local/apache_1.3.9/sbin
> ./apachectl configtest
Syntax error on line 207 of /w1/local/apache_1.3.9/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /w1/local/apache_1.3.9/libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so into
server: readExports: bad magic

Line 207 is:
LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Mon Dec  3 06:04:47 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Apache has been subsequently changed to use the native AIX dlopen() on your level of AIX.  Please try a fresh build with the latest level of Apache.  If the problem persists, open a new PR.

Thanks!
