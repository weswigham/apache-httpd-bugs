>Environment:
Env: RedHat Linux 5.2
Compiler: GNU gcc v2.7.2.3
>Description:
Using apache 1.3.4 with PHP3 module. Using NameVirtualHost, when number of virtual hosts exceed
approx 65 server will not start. Error log reports the following;

httpd: [Tue Apr  6 12:25:43 1999] [warn] (24)Too many open files: unable to open a file descriptor 
above 15, you may need to increase the number of descriptors

Have tried fixex for similar problems encountered in previous versions, no luck.
Have 1024 available file descriptors
Each virtual host has following layout;

<VirtualHost 203.12.144.46>
        ServerName web.hunterlink.net.au
        DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs
        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/"
        ErrorLog logs/web.hunterlink.net.au/error_log
        TransferLog logs/web.hunterlink.net.au/access_log
        AgentLog logs/web.hunterlink.net.au/agent_log
        RefererLog logs/web.hunterlink.net.au/referer_log
        RefererIgnore web.hunterlink.net.au
</VirtualHost>

Can successfully run multiple servers all using config file of approx 65 
VirtualHost entries.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use 
NameVirtualHost [IP ADDR]

and include 80+ 
<VirtualHost [IP ADDR]>
.
.
</VirtualHost>
>Fix:
Fixes for previous versions do not appear to work...

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr 20 11:22:38 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
See <http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/descriptors.html>
your config is chewing 4 descriptors per vhost.  Reduce
the number of logs.  redhat 5.2 uses linux 2.0.36 which
has a limit of 256 descriptors.
