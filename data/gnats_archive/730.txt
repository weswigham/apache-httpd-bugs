Linux POSIX
"uname -a" output: Linux results 1.1.59 #5 Sat Oct 29 18:57:33 CDT 1994 i486
C compiler: gcc version 2.4
>Description:
At compilation time, you get the next error message:

http_bprintf.o: Undefined symbol _frexp referenced from text segment
make: *** [httpd] Error 1

and then compilation aborts.

I have followed compilation instructions carefully.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compiling the source code again :)
>Fix:
No idea... I have looked for frexp funtion in all the sources, but it only appears
to be called on http_bprintf.

State-Changed-Why:
Looks like you have a really old version of linux.  Try maybe
adding -lm to the EXTRA_LFLAGS line in your Configuration.  If
that doesn't then you should try one of the linux newsgroups for
help.

Thanks for using apache
