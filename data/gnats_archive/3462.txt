Linux 2.0.36
gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
This problem occurs in two stages:
First, if apache is configured to log the results of identd queries, there will be no entries at all if someone is viewing those pages through a firewall
Second (and more serious) problem is that if we enable cgi-scripts and server side includes, no one behind those firewalls will get any pages.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just put "IdentityCheck on" to httpd.conf, and "Options Includes ExecCGI" to access config file and try to view any page through a firewall blocking identd queries..
>Fix:
Not right now, but I'll try to debug your code and fix this myself..

 I did some minor debugging, and found out that one way to "fix" the
 problem was to remove the timeout checking from the rfc1413.c and let the
 connect -function timeout. This on the other hand makes the access from
 those hosts behind firewall slow as hell but on the other hand it made
 the access possible.. Hope this gives you any clue on anything..
