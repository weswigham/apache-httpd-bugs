>Description:
'make install' executes 'chmod 644 $includedir/*.h $includedir/xml/*.h'
(where $includedir is specified in config.layout.
However if $includedir contains files other than Apache's (e.g. I have it set
to /usr/local/include), their permission is changed when it shouldn't, because
they may have been set to something special.
>How-To-Repeat:
In config.layout set includedir to a directory with random files that have a 
permission other than 644 and do a 'make install' then check the permissions
in that directory.
>Fix:
The 'chmod 644' should be applied only to the files coming from the Apache
distribution.
