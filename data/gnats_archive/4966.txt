Using Windows NT 4, with Perl 5 & 64 MB ram
>Description:
One of my CGI perl scripts has a problem.

When I run it on the server, it loads the Win32 command.com in a DOS Window.
I checked the error.log & it says premature end of script headers.

The script works fine on my friends WebSite Pro Web Server.

This was done locally.

I am unsure. Trying to figure this problem out.

Thanks for a great server.
