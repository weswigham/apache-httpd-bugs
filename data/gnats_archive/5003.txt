>Description:
I'm trying to install Apache-Server 1.3.9. I took from Apache web page the binary file apache_1.3.9-hp9000_715.hpux10.20.tar.gz.
When I'm running install-bindistr.sh I'm receiving messages saying:

tar: couldn't get gname for gid 110.

Could you get me some help in this case? Thank you and regards, Luis.
