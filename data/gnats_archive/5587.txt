>Description:
Error:  Apache has not been designed to serve pages while
        running as root.  There are known race conditions that
        will allow any local user to read any file on the system.
        If you still desire to serve pages as root then
        add -DBIG_SECURITY_HOLE to the EXTRA_CFLAGS line in your
        src/Configuration file and rebuild the server.  It is
        strongly suggested that you instead modify the User
        directive in your httpd.conf file to list a non-root
        user.
/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started
>How-To-Repeat:
compile apache 1.3.9 and set the User to root and Group to wheel.
>Fix:
The directions given to get apache to compile with support for running as root does not work.  what am I doing wrong?
