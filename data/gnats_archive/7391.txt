>Environment:
Windows ME, apache MSI installation
>Description:
When installing Apache 1.3.19 (MSI package) on Windows ME (dutch), I get an error: #Internal Error 2735: ResolveServerName#

This probably has something to do with the fact that the MSI package is trying to get to know the machine's servername, this to configure the httpd.conf file.
>How-To-Repeat:
I only get this error on a system with two OS's (Win2K server & WinME) on seperated partitions. Apache is already fully installed under Win2K.

The installation on a standalone WinME system is no problem.
>Fix:
I tried to install Apache 1.3.12 (binary EXE) instead. This works great but still the system can't resolve the servername, but that doesn't stop the install-procedure. Afterwards I can edit the configuration files myself, and everything is solved.
So, maybe there should be a binary EXE version of 1.3.19 released? Or the MSI could be altered?

State-Changed-Why:
Try assuring that winsock is loaded, IP is configured
correctly, and (if you use dial-up only) you are dialed-in
so that IP is actually running.
