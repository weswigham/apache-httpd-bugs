>How-To-Repeat:
Run apache on an NT Workstation 4.0.  Then install the binary distribution of perl for win32 (NOTE, not activeware).  Write a short little perl script, which uses the path to perl to invoke it, ie: #!c:/perl/bin/perl.  Then watch the error messages fly!
>Fix:
None, I have even asked around, and nobody has any clue.  Runtime problems are a bear to fix

Comment-Added:
And in the future, *please* put the description in the
"Description" field, not in the intended-to-be-an-abstract
synopsis field!

Here's the problem description copied from the original
synopsis:

I have a binary distribution of perl for win32. I get
several runtime errors when I invoke perl through a perl
script spawned by apache (Yes my #! is correct). Here is
one: The instruction at "0x77f6741b" referenced memory at
"0x000002af".  The memory could not be "read".   Here is
another: The exception unknown software exception
(0xc0000027) occurred in the application at location
0x77f3a90.
