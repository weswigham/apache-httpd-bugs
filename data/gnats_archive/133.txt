>Release:        1.2b6
>Environment:
Linux 2.0.27, GCC version 2.7.2, libc 5.4.7
>Description:
Compiled 1.2b6 configured the same as my old 1.2b4 server.  1.2b4
server working OK with mod_rewrite, 1.2b6 as a drop-in replacement
(same configuration) gives errors on most of not all URLs that
are being rewritten.  Same regexp "setup".
>How-To-Repeat:
Usually, requests to http://www.site.com/~user/ should be rewritten
(redirected) to http://home.site.com/user/ but it now gets redirected
to http://home.site.com/http/.
>Fix:
No.  I am going to look further into it but it is at least a clear
(for me) incompatibility with previous 1.2b releases

State-Changed-Why:
Known bug.  Change "sizeof(newuri-1)" in line 1547
to "sizeof(newuri)-1" and it should work.  If you have 
trouble finding it, let me know and I will mail you a 
patch.
