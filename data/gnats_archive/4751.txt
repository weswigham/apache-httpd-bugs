>Description:
I create a very simply registry form by html. A perl file in cgi-bin 
is going to receive the input data and send back a "Thank you" message.
But after the data was submit, I got a error message:"The server encountered 
an internal error or misconfigration and was unable to complete your request...".
It looks like that the server tried to find the perl file and run it, but failed.
  
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a simply form. In html file,".........<form method="POST" 
action="/cgi-bin/myscript.cgi">...........". And create a cgi file 
in cgi-bin....
>Fix:
Sorry, I don't know how to fix it now. I am trying.

State-Changed-Why:
I can assure you, CGIs work just fine.  You almost certainly
are not writing a proper CGI, but since you have provided
no details about your CGI there isn't much we can do to help
you there.  You should consult some CGI references that give
an introduction on how to write CGIs.
