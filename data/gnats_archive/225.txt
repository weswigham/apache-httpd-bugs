Solaris 2.5, compiler GNUCC 2.6.0.
>Description:
We transferred a WWW server from Apache 0.65 on HP UX 9.5 to
Apache 1.1.1 on Solaris 2.5, but we were not able to reactivate
the access control to some directories, even recreating the same
environment conditions.
It seems that on Solaris Apache is not able to match the passwords
for any user.

State-Changed-Why:
You don't say whether the problem is access being granted
without authentication, or access being denied despite
correct authentication.

Does your server configuration include a use of the
"AllowOverride AuthConfig" directive that covers the
directories in question?  Does the server access_log
contain messages indicating 401 status returned for the
pages requested?

State-Changed-Why:
This sounds like a byte-ordering problem on dbm files.  If your
passwords were stored in dbm files they may not be portable
between hp/ux and solaris boxes.

At any rate, closing this out assuming you've solved the problem
on your own.

Thanks for using Apache!
