>Description:
We have a .htaccess file on some of our servers that looks like,
reduced to the relevant parts:

order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 153.39               # UUNET office network
allow from 208.196.158.5        # eeg.va.pubnix.com
allow from 208.211.134          # Pubnix web development desktop/dev network

This was fine with apache 1.2.6.  1.3b6 complains:
[Wed Apr 22 11:56:04 1998] [alert] /homes/www068/w3featherlegged/html/.htaccess: syntax error in network portion of network/netmask
It is seeing the slash in the comment and taking it to be a netmask separator.

It is not documented specifically that comments are accepted in .htaccess files,
but aside from this new bug it has always worked.




>How-To-Repeat:
Put a comment containing a slash in a .htaccess file "allow" line,
or presumably a "deny" line.
>Fix:
1.  Document that comments are accepted in .htaccess files.
2.  Make the IP address or network parser pickier about the syntax it accepts,
    so it doesn't try to accept part of a comment as part of the address.
    Or just strip out comments before handing it the line to parse.

 That's fine, but in that case apache should print reasonable error
 messages rejecting lines with trailing comments, not do undefined
 things with them (such as silently accept them in some cases and
 suddenly break upon a new release :-).  Checking correctness seems be
 the apache approach to configuration file processing in other
 respects.

 It actually does a well defined thing with them... it treats them all as
 hostnames in this case.  In general there's not much we can do without
 overhauling the config language -- because the RAW_ARGS style of commands
 can do almost anything they want.  There's no well defined quoting style; 
 and inadequate centralized parsing.  It's somewhat difficult to shoehorn
 fixes into it.  A rewrite is definately in order.

 But the problem is that they aren't trailing comments; it just happens
 that you have specified that access should be allowed from a certain set
 of hostnames that you think should be a comment, but that Apache knows are
 just a list of space delimited hostnames.  We could special-case the '#'
 character or do more stringent checks for names that are valid in
 hostnames, but that can get to be a pain.

 Ah, I see!  Caught by surprise!  Don't special-case '#', but it's
 easy to write a function to tell whether a word could potentially
 be a valid hostname or IP address:
 
 int ap_hostname_syntax(char *s)
 {
     for (; *s; s++) {
 	/* Allow : for IPv6.  */
 	if (!isalnum(*s) && strchr("_-.:", *s) == NULL)
 	    return 0;
     }
     return 1;
 }
 
 I suggest using that where a valid hostname or IP address is required.

 Include a "/" in the strchr argument if you want to allow netmask
 specification, too.... or else split up the IP addr from the host
 before calling this.  It's not perfect, but it will help diagnose
 errors such as our staff made.  Or you could even have a function that
 takes a hostname or IP address or network number plus optional netmask,
 and returns a magic token or two depending on what sort of thing it
 determined it got passed.  I haven't looked, but you must have some
 code like that already.  It just needs to be more careful about what
 it accepts as a hostname... there's an RFC that specifies what
 characters can be in valid Internet hostnames.

 But the complication here is that these can be more than DNS hostnames. 
 They can be anything that a systems resolver can grok, and some such
 routines on some systems allow for less stringent naming rules that can
 allow other characters, possibly including '#'; I have no idea offhand.
 
 Isn't life fun.

 _ isn't valid though... I suppose we could do something like bind does
 with it; complain but allow it.

 Do you mean things like NIS+ or NeXT's net-thing?

 It's weirder than I thought.

 Yes, among others.  It is possible NT does similar things as well, but I
 don't know if they are integrated in the resolver calls we are using
 there.
