We were using 1.2.5 then upgraded to 1.2.6. users could not get into the location protected
by htaccess. Every attempt created a password mismatch in the error_log. We 
generating the passwords using makepass and htpasswd. The same htaccess 
password file worked fine on another machine running 1.2.6 (for SPARC solaris 2.6).

have seen problems with 2.8.0.
