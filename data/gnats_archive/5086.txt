State-Changed-Why:
Please follow the very basic steps we ask before submitting
a bug report.  Otherwise, you waste everyone's time.

What is in the error log?

What is in the access log?

This isn't likely to have much to do with Apache, but is
probably some other error you are making.  Apache has
very little to do with applets other than serving files.
