>Description:
Maybe I don't understand how #include virtual should work.
I have a simple file in <DocumentRoot>/example_html/example.jsp  
The first 2 example includes seem to work fine:

<html>
<head><title>Example ssi in java server pages</title></head>
<body>

<!--#include file="header.inc" -->

<!--#include virtual="/example_html/header.inc" -->

</body>
</html>

both using the header.inc in the example_html directory where in httpd.conf 
DocumentRoot "/usr2/local/apache/htdocs"
header.inc is in the <DocumentRoot>/example_html directory.

however, using the following format fails

<!--#include virtual="header.inc" --> 

The '#include virtual' is looking for the file in the DocumentRoot directory
instead of the "current directory" (<DocumentRoot>/example_html) where 
example.jsp is located. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a directory below the DocumentRoot directory
In the subdirectory,
Create a file header.inc that has the following line

This is the header <br>

Create a java server page example.jsp file with the following contents:

<html>
<head><title>Example ssi in java server pages</title></head>
<body>
<!--#include virtual="header.inc" -->
<p>Test page</p>
</body>
</html>
