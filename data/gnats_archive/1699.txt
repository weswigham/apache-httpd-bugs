>Release:        1.3b3
>Environment:
In 1.3 there is a new feature which allows sortable directory listing if a 
directory listing is displayed with FancyIndexing.  However there is no way 
to default how a list is sorted, like sort by LastModified with latest date 
first. The default of this was never programed into the new version.  Is it 
possible to add a directive like: ColumnSorting LastDate, or the such?

>How-To-Repeat:
N/A - not in the version.  The default can't be changed.
>Fix:
Add a directive like: ColumnSorting string [string], where string is the 
Name/Size/LastModified/Description.  The option second string could sort in the
reverse order?  The first being ascending the second descending?

Ex: ColumnSorting Size - sorts ASCENEDING on Size
    ColumnSorting LastModified LastModied - sorts DESCENDING on LastModifie

State-Changed-When: Tue Jan 20 05:55:41 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The 1.3 default order is the same as the *only* ordering
available in previous versions: ascending by file name.
We will consider providing a means of controlling the
default ordering key, but for now the only solution is
to add the query argument to the URL (e.g., "?M=A" to
order by ascending Last-Modified times).  This report is
being suspended so the issue won't be forgotten.  Thank
you for reporting it, and for using Apache!

State-Changed-When: Mon Jan  4 12:26:01 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:

A new directive, IndexOrderDefault, has been added for the
next release after 1.3.3.  It allows you to change the
default sort order used to display the list of files.
Thanks for the report, and for using Apache!
