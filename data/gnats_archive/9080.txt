This is a patch against 1.3.22
>Description:
We have some clients whose apps take a long time to create content, so
we have to run apache with Timeout set to 600. (They actually want more
- yuck).

Anyway, on our internal network (large, international), we have problems
with buggy clients connecting to apache and then not sending a request.
This hogs an apache child - unfortunately they often do this in crazy
doses - our primary production server with a MaxClients of 700 gets
DoS'd all to hell as all 700 children are sat trying to read a request
from a bad client. (The bad clients commonly spawn 300+ connections in
only a few seconds).

Server status looks a lot like:
9-1111010/142/628 R 0.95 99 2 0.0 0.22 0.88 ? ? ..reading..
One for each child.

The reads don't time out for 10 minutes - a classic DoS.

Further to this, unless I'm missing something crucial, 700 people
telnetting to port 80 or one guy with a 6 line perl script can DoS the
webserver quite easily.

We needed to fix this without affecting the main Timeout setting - the
apps are still slow...

Fixing the buggy clients is not an option, I'm afraid.

I've fixed this for us by adding a new timeout setting,
ReadRequestTimeout, which only applies during the period apache is trying
to read a request from the client.

I thought I'd send in the patch - even if you don't want it, feedback on
a better way to tackle this problem would be welcome.

ReadRequestTimeout in this patch defaults to DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (300), so
existing installations will be unaffected. I use 5 for our installations.
The changes are minor, as seen in the patch below.
