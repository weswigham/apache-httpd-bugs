>Description:
I downloaded apache_1.3.12.tar.gz to my windows system. I then used ftp to move it to the server. Using telnet, I created an apache_1.3.12 directory in /usr/src and moved the file there. I then, gunzipped, and untarred the file. Okay so far, but this were the instructions start. Apache-1.3-docs.pdf.gz was the ONLY documentation available. They tell me to run % Configure. No such command They tell me there is supposed to be a httpd file in /usr/src No such luck. I thought I was doing great to get away from buggy Microsoft, but you guys offer buggy docs, if any.
>How-To-Repeat:
All I can say is try.
>Fix:
YES. Please tell me what I am supposed to do. And don't tell me to ask usnets, because they are a bunch of amatuers trying to figure it out themselves. EVERYBODY gives me different directions.

State-Changed-Why:
If you are completely new to this stuff, you should consider
buying a book, or paying someone for support.  The support
offered in the newsgroups is generally very good,
but you need to ask the right questions.  (Hint:
be as specific as possible.)

The docs should tell you that Configure is located
in the src directory of the Apache distribution.
The httpd binary will only be in src AFTER you have
successfully built apache.

The places to find documentation are at
http://www.apache.org/docs/
and instruction on how to build apache are
in the root directory of the source distribution
(the INSTALL file will probably help). 

Good luck.
(Future support questions posted here will likely
not be answered, since this is a bug database,
not a support forum.)
