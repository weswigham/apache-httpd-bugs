>Environment:
Solaris 2.4 - patchlevel 101945-41
gcc 2.6.3
>Description:
Under Solaris 2.4 the bcopy system routine has to be included from the 
Sunos compatability libraries. I modified the link step so that it
was preceeded by 

	LD_RUN_PATH=/usr/lib: ... system  spec stuff ... :/usr/ucblib ; \
	export LD_RUN_PATH ; \
	$(CC) $(LFLAGS)  -o httpd $(OBJS) $(REGLIB) $(LIBS) -L/usr/ucblib -lucb
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile under Solaris 2.4 with the proxy module 
>Fix:
See above - perhaps a better way would be to remove th bcopy reference 
(or blanket it with #ifdefs) in proxy_ftp.c
