 >Each VirtualHost must correspond to a different IP address, different port number or a different host name for the server, in the latter case the server machine must be configured to accept IP packets for multiple addresses. (If the machine does not hav e multiple network interfaces, then this can be accomplished with the ifconfig alias command (if your OS supports it), or with kernel patches like VIF (for SunOS(TM) 4.1.x)).
 	'in the latter case' should be
 	'in the former case'. As written, it isn't true -- I have Apache responding to multiple hostnames on a single IP on a single NIC.
