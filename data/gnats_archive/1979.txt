>Environment:
Linux 2.0.32, RedHat 5.0, i386 (P5/133), gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
When the description field is turned disabled, the space on the page from it is not reclaimed.  This can be a big problem in a situation where files with long names are being server ("SuperDuperBigPatch-0.." which version is it?).  I have provided a simplistic patch that allows for two states, one with SUPPRESS_DESC and one without.  I guess this is really more of a proof of concept patch, but I have been using it on my server for a few weeks, both on pages with and without SuppressDescription.

Aaah, Opensource.  If you don't like the program, fix it.

State-Changed-Why:
A generic, preferable "printf" style way to specify field
lengths is the right solution; any others are just half-
steps.  Someone in the group is lazily working on something
like that; of course if you're motivated (go! go!) it would
be really cool to see.

Thanks for the note.

State-Changed-When: Wed Sep  2 14:19:40 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

The column widths in the output from mod_autoindex are
intended to be relatively fixed-width.  As of the next
release after 1.3.1, you can use a combination of the
SuppressDescription and NameLength keywords to size
the filename column to take advantage of the space not
used by the description.  This puts the sizing under the
explicit control of the Webmaster, and violates the
Principle of Least Astonishment less.  Thanks for the
report, the patch, and for using Apache!
