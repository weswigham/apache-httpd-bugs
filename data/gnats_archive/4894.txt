>Release:        1.3.9
>Environment:
NT 4.0sp5 Server, dual P2@450Mhz generic box, 256 MB
>Description:

Examined the shortcut installed as a menu entry within
Start->Programs->Apache Web Server->Install as a Service:

The shortcut is not pointing to anything and is infact null.  The installation
appears to fail just after the notice asking about the read-me and presenting the 
"Finish" button.  Reliably.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run the win32 1.3.9 install
>Fix:
Fix the null pointer, the uninitialized variable?  Other than that, you would know 
far better than I would
