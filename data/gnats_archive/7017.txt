IE5 should support the digest auth-scheme (as written in the docs).
I made two user-password-files (users.digest and users.basic with htdigest.exe/htpasswd.exe)

When I use:
<Location /admin/>
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "xxx"
  AuthUserFile d:/3dx/users.basic
  Require valid-user
</Location>

everything works fine with IE5.5 and Navigator. IE5.5 and Navigator will both ask for username and password and if they are correct, Apache will let me in.
I used the URL http://127.0.0.1/admin/test.htm, for example.

But when I use instead:
<Location /admin/>
  AuthType Digest
  AuthName "xxx"
  AuthDigestFile d:/3dx/users.digest
  Require valid-user
</Location>

I can't login with Navigator - ok, that's normal because Navigator doesn't support Digest.
(Navigator asks me nevertheless for username/password and the apache-error-log tells me correctly "client used wrong authentication scheme: ...")
BUT: when calling the same page with IE5.5, I will get an "The page cannot be displayed (cannot find server)"-error!
There is no entry in the Apache error-log for this call!
I can call any page outside the /admin/-directory with IE5.5 but I will get the error when calling any file IN the directory (when using the Digest-scheme instead of the Basic-scheme).

A snippet from my httpd.conf:
#LoadModule digest_auth_module modules/ApacheModuleAuthDigest.dll
#LoadModule cern_meta_module modules/ApacheModuleCERNMeta.dll
LoadModule digest_module modules/ApacheModuleDigest.dll

I'm wondering if I have to enable the first line? But there is no ApacheModuleAuthDigest.dll in the Apache1.3.14-distribution!?

What must I do to fix this problem? Thanks for your help!

 Yes, thanks, I will try this. I used the release apache_1_3_14_win32.exe 
 not ...win32_r2.exe - I think this will solve the problem.
