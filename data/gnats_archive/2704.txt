IRIX64 6.4 02121744 IP27
>Description:
After 108 ErrorLog directives on a single Apache instance, the root errorlog will say 
there is no such file or directory on the errorlog for a certain ErrorLog directive.
Apache has been compiled with the -DNO_SLACK option, and the OS does not seem to be
out of file descriptors. As a test, an AccessLog Directive was commented out, and a 109th 
ErrorLog turned on, and this still did not work, so it appears to be specific to 
ErrorLog.
