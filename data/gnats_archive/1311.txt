FreeBSD
>Description:
The first disadvantage of Apache's fnmatch.c is that it have several bugs
already fixed in FreeBSD fnmatch.c version, just compare latest
FreeBSD fnmatch.c code with Apache variant and you'll see.
Even if Apache moves to FreeBSD fnmatch.c variant, it will not be nice
since internal function occupes code space while standard version
taken from shared library once and not occupes memory.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add an option to compile with default system fnmatch.c for people
who knows what they do

Sorry, no.  If fnmatch is buggy, please report specific bugs, the
version in there is from a recent FreeBSD tree.  We've
had enough "Fun" dealing with OS-specific regex problems.  If
we need to supply fnmatch for any OS, then we'll supply it for
all of them.

 Well, FreeBSD version really have many enhancements like CASEFOLD or
 LEADING_DIR and l10n support, but real bugfix in the same abilities range
 as Apache fnmatch is only one, here the patch:

 --- src/main/fnmatch.c=09Thu Oct 23 14:37:04 1997

   =09    if ((pattern =3D
