SunOS new-york 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.6/2.7.2.2/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
While the logging module allows for tracking the duration of a request, the time
granularity is too coarse for tracking software (such as ours). I have added
another configurable option which allows for millisecond granularity of
transaction durations. Optimally I would like to see this folded into the
released version of Apache.

cheers,

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
add to httpd.conf:

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"
\"-\" \"-\" %m" netgenesis
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"
\"-\" \"%{cookie}n\" %m" netgenesis_cookie

then somewhere below:

CustomLog /<...path to log file goes here...>/access_log netgenesis
