>Description:
Sometimes (seemingly randomly) the full output of a CGI script (PERL)
is not getting sent to the browser. If I run the script directly
on the server everything works correctly. I have tried resetting the $|
(buffer) special variable in PERL (setting to non-zero makes things worse).

It seems more likely to occur if the CGI script called by the browser
itself calls other scripts, but even a simple script can cause the problem.

This problem did not exist in release 1.3.4.

>How-To-Repeat:
I have currently regressed back to apache 1.3.4 which fixes the problem.
>Fix:
Take a look at what changed between 1.3.4 and 1.3.6
