php version 4.0.4pl1
apache version 1.3.19
>Description:
I installed Apache 1.3.19 and php4.0.4pl1 on Win2k and
tried to load the php4 module into the apache service.
entry in the httpd.conf:
"LoadModule php4_module h:\php\sapi\php4apache.dll"

But the Service cannot start.
error message:
------------------
Syntax error in line 205 of h:/apache/conf/httpd/conf
Cannot load h:\php\sapi\php4apache.dll into server: (127) The give Procedure wasn´t found
--------------------
(translated)
The German original message:
-------------------
Syntax error in line 205 of h:/apache/conf/httpd/conf
Cannot load h:\php\sapi\php4apache.dll into server: (127) Die angegebene prozedur wurde nicht gefunden
--------------------

I exchanged the php4apache.dll from the distribution "php4.0.4pl1" with the one out of 
"php4.0.4-dev". Then the error message didn't appear, but the service cannot start as well!

The same php module is working under Apache 1.3.14 for windows. 

I downloaded the php4.0.4pl1 distribution from php.net, and loaded no modules, the php.exe can start without problems as standalone programm.

(Before this installation i had running:
apache 1.3.14 and php4.0.4-dev, but had different difficultieswith that release )
