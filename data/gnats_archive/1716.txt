Re: How to compile APACHE 1.3b3 for WINDOWS 95/NT using Borland C++ 5.0
Date: 01/22/98 6:00 PM CST
This is not as much a problem report as it is a SOLUTION report.
I obtained APACHE v1.3b3 source code 72 hours ago and I now have
a WORKING version for WINDOWS 95/NT that was compiled using the
BORLAND C++ 5.0 COMPILER AND/OR IDE.
I could find NO HELP in doing this so I am assuming I'm the first.
There are MANY PROBLEMS to overcome as far as differences between
MAKE/NMAKE and the actual Microsoft environment versus Borland.
Anyone there interested in the details? If so, let me know... too
much to go into here. Send EMAIL to TOKILEY@aol.com if interested.

State-Changed-Why:
In theory, I don't see a reason why we wouldn't be interested
in supporting alternate compilers for Win32.  In practice,
we need someone or a group of people who are willing to stick
around and update the alternate-compiler makefile as other
makefiles are changed.  If you're interested enough to watch
the commit logs and make sure your Borland makefile stays 
up to date, great!  We can facilitate that.  If not, the
makefile by itself won't help us very much.  

Thanks.
