>Description:
An apparently-spurious error is logged as a result of generating an index page
for a directory which includes a sub-directory which is protected against the 
client.

With FancyIndexing enabled for a directory ("A"), no index.html, and a 
subdirectory ("B") with .htaccess file which limits access by client domain,
an error

This appears to be harmless apart from any confusion the log entries might cause
and the potential for generating a lot of log entries if a popular directory 
has a protected subdirectory.

access to <protdir> failed for <client>, reason: Client denied by server configurationin, an error 

(where <protdir> is the protected subdirectory "B" and <client> the client host)
is logged whenever a generated index is returned for directory "A" to a client
which is not allowed access to directory B. 

It does not happen when there is an index.html in directory A. I cannot see any
reason for an error to be logged unless/until the client attempts to access the
protected directory's contents. The dynamic index returned to the client
includes details of the protected directory as normal.

State-Changed-Why:
This occurs because Apache has to verify the access rights to
each file that it indexes.  The same thing would happen if you
had a <Files> directive limiting access to a file in the directory.
There's really no workaround for it ... except to structure your
site to avoid this.

It has to verify the access rights because of features that
read the contents of the files.
