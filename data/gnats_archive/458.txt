bind: Address already in use
httpd: could not bind to port xxx.

When I send a HUP signal to re-read the configuration (kill -HUP pid) the same messages appear, the parent httpd process is killed, the child processes remain (but the do not respond to requests) and I connot kill them (ussing kill -TERM xxx)

State-Changed-Why:
Take a peek at www.apache.org/docs/unixware.html and ensure
that you've applied the appropriate patches and taken the
appropriate steps.

1.2b9 has many fixes in the area of restart, so if you could
try it when it's released in a few days that'd be great.
