>Description:
With Netscape version 1.xx or IE 2.x, users can not access any virtual hosts configured for the server.  This was working fine until web server was moved to a new machine.  The DNS for the virtual host web site was changed to match the new machine since the physical handling of the virtuals was on another machine.  I moved the virtual devices to the new web server in an attempt to recreate the envirionment from the previous machine.  Additionally, http://virtualdomain.com works fine but http://www.virtualdomain.com will not work even though the DNS for both www.virtualdomain.com returns the same IP as virtualdomain.com.  Also, this problem does not exist for virtuals with a ORG extension.  I have tried using both IP and domain name in the <VirtualHost > directive.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem is normally caused by a misconfiguration in
the server config files so the server thinks that some of
the virtualhosts are supposed to be non-IP virtual hosts.

Please verify the examples you gave.  I can see no problems
with the ones you list, except for the fact that
www.biblenetlive.org does not exist.

Please provide the appropriate sections of your config files,
along with a description of what virtual domains should go
where and which don't.

 Sorry, biblenetlive.org is a new domain.  And I was wrong about the problem
 not occuring with .ORG domains.  It happens on those.
 
 Be sure to use netscape 1.22 or IE 2.0
 
 Try:  www.modestoathletics.com, www.cimaged.com, cimaged.com,
 www.alsfurniture.com, www.modesto-horology.com
 
 The web server IP is 204.216.26.8, DNS server is 204.216.26.2
 
 Currently, www.modestoathletics.com, www.alsfurniture.com,
 www.modesto-horology.com have DNS A records to 204.216.26.8.
 
 modestoathletics.com, alsfurniture.com, modesto-horology.com have DNS A
 records to their respective virtual IP in order listed: 204.216.26.38,
 204.216.26.40, 204.216.26.30.
 
 www.cimaged.com (my testing case) has DNS A record to 204..216.26.45 (its
 virtual IP). cimaged.com also has DNS A record to 204.216.26.45.
 
 Below is the virtual settings from httpd.conf.  Attached are all my *.conf
 files.
 
 
 Thank you, your help is much appreciated.

 As documented in many places, non-IP virtual hosting (using the same IP
 address and the Host: header) does not work with old browsers because they
 don't send it.  You are not dedicating an IP to each www.<x>.com, so
 Apache has no choice but to use non-IP virtual hosting which does not work
 with older clients.
 
 If you want Apache to use IP-based virtual hosting, which works with older
 clients, then you need to give each domain a seperate IP.  Having a
 seperate IP for <x>.com does nothing for www.<x>.com, which is what you
 are telling the webserver to use.

 Apache can do both non-IP virtual hosting and IP based virtual hosting
 without problems.
 
 I still do not see any problem with www.cimaged.com or cimaged.com.  You
 keep changing what you say is having problems without giving the full
 details of what is happening with what servers and what you consider a
 problem.  This wastes time for everyone.
 
 Bug reports are not really designed for asking configuration questions.

 Hello Marc!
 
 Sorry to take up your time, but what appeared to be a bug with Apache is
 actually a bug with Netscape 1.22.
 
 After I made the required changes to used the assigned IP for cimaged.com
 with Apache and still did not see any change on how netscape viewed the
 site.  I tried flushing Netscape's disk and memory cache to no avail.  I
 restarted netscape with no  positive result.  I deleted netscapes
 configuration files, .hst, .tpl.  you name it..no dice didn't see
 www.cimaged.com.
 
 I then restarted Windows, went back into netscape and it worked for the
 first time.  It appears that netscape 1.22 is relying on some cached
 information that is persistent within Windows.
 
 Thanks for your time, problem resolved.
 Jose de Leon
