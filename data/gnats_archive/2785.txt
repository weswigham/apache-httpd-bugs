>Release:        1.3.1
>Environment:
AIX 4.2.1, using XLC
Apache is compiling and running perfectly well
>Description:
When running daemons under AIX, it is often desirable to run them under control of the SRC (System Resource Controller).
The least you need is to prevent the detach() call in httpd_main.c. This is currently not supported.

Question 1: Is anyone working on this? Would you even consider it?
Question 2: What command line switch should be used for "prevent detach"?
>How-To-Repeat:
it's not really a problem, merely a suggestion
>Fix:
I can provide fully tested and QA'ed patches for the SRC API (the real one).
Would you be interested that I seek permission with IBM to provide them to you?
