>Environment:
Linux 2.0.27, gcc 2.7.2
>Description:
All of our SSIs using exec cgi no longer work; they fail with the
error "Unable to spawn child process." Furthermore, lately even our
regular CGI scripts have begun to fail with this error message.
Neither our config file nor our CGIs have been changed.
>How-To-Repeat:
A simple server-side include using exec cgi will show the problem.
>Fix:
I've looked at the code briefly but I don't see anything obviously
wrong

State-Changed-Why:
Did you modify anything in your setup that could cause this?
Did you traffic increase lately?  If so you may be running
out of system resources like swap space or may be running
into OS-specific limits on resource use.
