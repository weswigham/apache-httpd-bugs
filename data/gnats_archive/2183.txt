In my httpd.conf, there is an entry

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common

and

<VirtualHost 11.22.33.44>
# 1234 vhost
DocumentRoot /home/u1234/www/docs
ServerName www.1234.tld
CustomLog /home/u1234/www/logs/common.log common
</VirtualHost>

This results in the word "common" (and nothing else) being logged to the
file common.log.

As all the other directives OUTSIDE VirtualHost containers are global,
shouldn't the definition of LogFormat nicknames be global, too?

Best regards

Alex
