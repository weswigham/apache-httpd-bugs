 THE WALLSTREET UNIVERSE REPORT - NOVEMBER 10, 2001
 Next Holiday - Thanksgiving:  Turkey, Football and Relatives!

 Hello All  Investors,
 
 On Sunday night we will be sending out a new stock profile.  Our
 last few profiles have performed with increased volume and nice
 gains!!!  We look for this new stock to have an explosive next
 week.  Keep your eyes open and Have a Great Weekend!!!
 
 
 
 +>+>+>  AND COMMING UP...  Next week will be moderately busy in
 terms of economic reports.  On Wednesday  we=92ll get the October
 Retail Sales report, which is most likely to show growth over the
 month of September thanks to record-setting auto sales as well as
 to discount shopping.  Also a number of readings on the
 manufacturing industry will be issued including the Philadelphia
 Fed survey, Business Inventories and  Industrial Production.=20
 Those reports for the most part are not expected to reveal
 anything encouraging.  Finally, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is
 due out next Friday, and like today=92s PPI numbers it is expected
 to indicate that inflation remains under control.=20=20
 
 Although the corporate earnings season was over in October, a
 bulk of key tech companies will report their results next week.=20
 Among them are Dell Computer, Hewlett Packard &  Applied
 Materials.   Besides earnings and economic reports, developments
 on the Afghanistan front will undoubtedly remain on everyone=92s
 radar screen and any further military progress over the weekend
 could be an important catalyst for this market.
