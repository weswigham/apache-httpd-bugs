Windows 95 and Windows 98.
>Description:
Apache worked for about 9 or 10 times (starting, stopping and restarting).
After a problem with a virtualhost setting (I didn't have the DocumentRoot Directory
created), it wouldn't start. Everytime I try to start apache now.. It comes back with

[Wed Apr 07 16:25:19 1999] [warn] pid file c:/apache/logs/httpd.pid overwritten
-- Unclean shutdown of previous Apache run?


Then exits. (Of course, the date and time are different each time I run it)

In the older versions... it would say this but just keep running. If fact 1.3.4
would keep running and now it won't.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try making a VirtualHost with its DocumentRoot not in existance.
For example..

<VirtualHost test.apache.org>
   DocumentRoot /home/test/html
</VirtualHost>
Where /home/test/html (c:\) does NOT exist. Try starting Apache a few times and maybe
you will encounter the same error.
>Fix:
I have no idea.
