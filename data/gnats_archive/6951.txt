This error has been consistently produced on two different servers:
1.:
Linux ronja.tpv.dk 2.2.16-22 #1 Tue Aug 22 16:16:55 EDT 2000 i586 unknown, Running RedHat Linux 7.0
2.:
Linux dyrup.dsa-net.dk 2.2.17 #1 SMP Tue Sep 5 10:33:49 CEST 2000 i686 unknown, Running RedHat Linux 6.2
On both computers Apache where installed with standard RedHat RPM's
>Description:
Nothing out of the ordinary GETs are logged or shown. Apache simply fails to send the entire .pdf file. The file are 1.9MB in size, and only about the first and a half page are shown - if the "client" will scroll down further the browser (IE 5.0) freezes. Downgrading Apache to 1.3.12 fixes the problem - upgrading to 1.3.14 makes the problem come back.
>How-To-Repeat:
The .pdf can be found at http://www.dsa-net.dk/velkommen/dsanyt/nov2000.pdf (It's in danish - don't bother reading it!) :-)
>Fix:
No, sorry.
