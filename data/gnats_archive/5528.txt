GCC
------
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
When the logfile is very big that OS cannot handle, Apache does not give any idea in error log files to admin recognize the problem. I notices the log files size is over 2Gb and OS cannot handle it, but apache does not gives any error messages about it.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
:) yes, apache can write "The logfile %s 's size is very big... try to parse.."
