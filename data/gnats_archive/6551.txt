>Description:
Guys, this has been reported many times (5720, 5722, 5736, 5821..etc). The 
official response was that an underscore isn't officially recognized as a 
valid character in a hostname (see PR #5821)

That's nice. However, rather than getting into a pissing contest, can we not
just agree that the developer making the modification in 1.3.11 WAS "technically 
correct" so as not to hurt his feelings (that's the only reason I can figure
this wasn't just fixed), and then move on?

This REDUCED functionality in Apache, SEVERELY in my case where I host 500,000
virtual hosts - probably 1% of which have underscores in them. DNS resolves names
with underscores just fine; why in the world would we destroy the functionality
to serve some virtual hosts just in the name of being technically correct?

I would expect this kind of answer from Netscape or Microsoft; I'm completely
stunned to see this kind of response from Apache after having submitted many
bug reports and several patches to Apache Jserv over the last couple of years -
some dealing with issues that were "technically correct!"

It's a ONE LINE FIX and makes Apache a more robust solution. Why NOT do it?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to use a virtual host with an underscore.
>Fix:
change line 673 in http_vhost.c

State-Changed-Why:
The patch you suggest is not acceptable because Apache's
default should be to comply with the standard. If you can
produce a patch to implement a configuration directive that
enables invalid host names then we'll consider it for inclusion.
