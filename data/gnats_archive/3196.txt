>Description:
Server root is d:\apache. I want to provide access to other drives, using user authentication for security. This can not be set up and I believe it is due to continuing incorrect handling of root directories.

This works
----------
Alias /cdir "C:/dir1/"
<Directory "C:/dir1">
AuthUserFile "users.acl"
AuthType Basic
AuthName RestrictedInformation
require user fred
</Directory>

This does not work:
-------------------
Alias /cdir "C:/"
<Directory "C:/">
AuthUserFile users.acl
AuthType Basic
AuthName RestrictedInformation
require user fred
</Directory>

Client message:
   Not Found. The requested URL /cdir/ was not found on this server
Error log entry:
  [Tue Oct 13 12:06:57 1998] [error] [client 194.66.234.253] File does not exist: c://

(Get the same error if Directory directive is to "C:")
>How-To-Repeat:
Behind firewall
>Fix:
Before v1.3.3 I could set the program start-up directory to the root directory of the drive from which apache was run. This work-around no longer works.

In your nonworking example, try changing

  Alias /cdir "C:/"

to

  Alias /cdir/ "C:/"

and see if that makes any difference.

 I changed the line in srm.conf to :

 with entry in access.conf still:
 
 <Directory "C:/">
 AuthUserFile users.acl
 AuthType Basic
 AuthName RestrictedInformation
 require user fred
 </Directory>
 
 Used URL: http://ip.address/cdir/
 
 Result: Provides index listing, but ignores user authentication.

Richard,

I just tried this with Apache 1.3.5-dev 
(a tarball from 1/27/99) on NT 4.0 SP3.
(this setup is basically what you did
in your last attempt)

Alias /croot/ c:/

<Directory "c:/">
AuthUserFile "userauth.uaf"
AuthType Basic
AuthName RestrictedInformation
require user foo
</Directory>


And this worked for me.  Maybe you can try this
again with Apache 1.3.4?

Couple of things to watch for:
-Browsers (like IE) may add a trailing '/' to 
your URL, so that is the reason the Alias needs the
trailing '/'
-Make sure you haven't already entered the userid and
password for another restricted area, otherwise the
browser caches that info and will not ask you again, and
it may appear as though you got to the index without
authorization.

Let us know! 

Thanks for using Apache.

When I request
http://x.y.z/croot
I do not get prompted for a password, but the 
server does return file not found.  This is working as
expected because you have an alias set up for /croot/
but not /croot 

Ken Coar and I were just talking about this, and here
is his take:

There needs to be parity wrt trailing slashes on the alias
and the target.  And, if your target is a directory on
your C drive, this causes no problem.  I.e., the following
would (should) both work:

Alias /cdir "C:/cdir"
Alias /cdir/ "C:/cdir/"

Unfortunately, due to Win32's concept of per-drive current
directory, *all* references that mention drive letters must
be absolute (i.e., must begin with "letter:/").  So if
you want to alias a URI to the top of your C drive as
mentioned here, you run into the slash parity problem: your
alias needs to have it in order to match the required
syntax of the target.

This appears to be a Win32 restriction.  The only possible
solution I see is to add a Redirect or Rewrite rule
that converts "/cdir" into "/cdir/" and leave the
'Alias /cdir/ "C:/"' in there.
