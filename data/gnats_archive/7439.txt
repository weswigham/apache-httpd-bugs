RedHat 6.2 on i686
>Description:
If the real server is using basic auth, as well as the proxy. the Servers BasicAuth header is trashed when going through the ProxyPass proxy.

It also looks like the ProxyPass directive passes on it's Basic-Auth header, the one that is used between the client and the proxy, to the real server.
That probably destroys the Basic-Auth header that the Server sends out.

When using the setup described under the "repeat problem" tag
I'm alternately getting the AuthName from the proxy and from the Server.
Both of them rejects the BasicAuth header that is sent and requests a new one.
= Infinite loop.


>How-To-Repeat:
Setup:

Proxy server:
------------------------------------------------------------------
ProxyPass               /basic-auth     http://server/basic-auth
ProxyPassReverse        /basic-auth     http://server/basic-auth
<Location "/basic-auth">
          AuthName        "The Proxy test"
          AuthType        Basic
          AuthUserFile    /etc/httpd/conf/proxy.passwd
          require  valid-user
</Location>
---------------------------------------------------------------
Real server:
<Location "/basic-auth">
          AuthName        "The Real server"
          AuthType        Basic
          AuthUserFile    /etc/httpd/conf/server.passwd
          require  valid-user
</Location>


There is no way to get through.
