hpux 10.20 using GCC
>Description:
I am getting the exact same error as pr#4021 and I have recompiled GCC 4 times. 
I have the exact same server configuration.

Stop.
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!

State-Changed-Why:
And it is the same problem as in the other PR: your compiler
is not installed properly.  Doing the same thing over and
over won't necessarily fix it.  You have to ensure you have
the right version of gcc for your OS and are following all
the installation instructions.  In this case, it appears your
version of as can't handle the output of your compiler.
