>Description:
HP-UX 9.x has a very "special" select prototype. This causes a harmless
warning while compiling mod_fastcgi.c. HP-UX 10.x has been fixed.

cc -Ae -c   +O3 +DA1.1 +DS1.1 -DHPUX -DSTATUS   mod_fastcgi.c
cc: "mod_fastcgi.c", line 3554: warning 604: Pointers are not assignment-compatible.
...

   status = select(
           numFDs, &read_set, &write_set, NULL, timeOutPtr);

On HP-UX 9.x, a cast to (int *) is required for read_set and write_set.

State-Changed-Why:

mod_fastcgi has been removed from future Apache releases
(i.e., reverted to the status of a normal contributed module)
since it is maintained by its authors at OpenMarket.  You
can get an updated version from www.openmarket.com.
