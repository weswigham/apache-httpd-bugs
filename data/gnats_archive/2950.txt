>Environment:
BSDI BSD/OS 3.1 i386 with all patches applied

gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
I wasn't able to get a core dump so I added some debugging messages. I tracked
the problem to the following chunk of code in proxy_util.c starting at line 592:
                    if (! ok) {
                        ap_pclosef(c->req->pool, c->fp->fd);
                        c->fp = NULL;
                        unlink(c->tempfile);
                        c = NULL;
                    }
c->fp is NULL when this code gets executed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try retrieving a long document through the proxy. (I tested using the HTTP
protocol drafts at www.w3.org). Abort the connection after at least a small
part of it has been received. Try again if you don't see the seg fault.
Sometimes it takes more than 1 abort to see the error.
>Fix:
No. I tried stepping through the code, but I ran out of time to work on the
problem.
