 Hello,
 
 I was looking through the Apache bug database and found a problem
 description that sounds suspiciously like the problem that I am
 experiencing. (PR #3906: http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/3906)
 
 Everything about this problem fits what I see except that I am running
 Apache v1.3.12. The version of Solaris is the same, I have KeepAlives turned
 off, and seemingly randomly my httpd processes are getting hung in a
 ..Reading... state for extended periods of time. The only other difference
 is that we are not using mod_perl at all.
 
 Interestingly, if we turn off the feed from the internet, but leave Apache
 running, sometimes, but not always the hung processes will then recover and
 return to normal.
 
 I looked into the file http_main.c, where you have suggested to the user to
 place a patch. Unfortunately it appears that the line numbers are not the
 same anymore. So, I wanted to be sure that I was fixing the code properly
 and thought I'd ask for help. Can you give me a version of the suggested fix
 that I can apply to Apache 1.3.12?
