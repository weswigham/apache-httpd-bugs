>Description:
I'm trying to use Expect as a CGI script:
#!/usr/local/bin/expect 
puts "Content-type: text/HTML\n"
spawn /bin/telnet xxx
...

It can't get trough "spawn". It creates two processes for pseudoterminal
and stands there. 
Script works fine when run under "nobody" user.

State-Changed-Why:
I doubt this is Apache's problem at all.  I would suggest trying
a second \n in your puts, which is required to terminate the CGI
header.  Beyond that I suggest asking in one of the newsgroups suggested
on the bug form as we can't help with the plethora of
basic CGI questions we get regularly.

Thanks for using Apache!
