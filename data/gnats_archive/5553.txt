>Description:
   The problem is that when I access my website at www.aecom.yu.edu/xray
I noticed that almost after each HTML page retrieval my free memmory
reduces in size dramtically. On the order of 8-200Kb per one page.
I am just developing this web site and though we have a huge memory
about 1GB it shrinks rather rapidaly though almost nobody uses this site
at the moment. I am scared. Apache server was installed by Dell in its default
configuration. I changed certain things in the configuration files but everything works really smoothly except this memory leak problem. I planned
to give opportunity to other people to run programs which require 300-400 M
of memory. But because of this terrible memory leak I may run into severe
trouble. I am loosing memory with a spread of 3-6/megabytes per day though
the machine is almost empty. I cannot say for sure that is Apache's problem
but when your memory disappears after each browser click you maybe convinced too.
I don't see any errors in the /etc/httpd/logs/error_log file. Nothing.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well it's easy. You just type
   telnet bertrand.bioc.aecom.yu.edu
   user   strokop
   password m$scow1
   
   and then use 

free, top

 or whatever and see how memory dissapears after
each browser click on my site. Sometimes as much as 100-200 KB disappears at once. Amazing!
Unbelievable!
>Fix:
No idea! I am just scared. I do some scientific Fortran programming and know to some extent other languages (Perl, Javascript). In my opinion it's something
very wrong with Apache 1.3.6 or libraries it is using.

 This got cut off a bit:
 
 I see no reason to think there is anything wrong here, least of all with
 Apache.  As the system runs, Linux normally uses more and more memory for
 disk caching.  This is completely normal.  You would be best served asking
 such questions in a Linux support forum if you want an explaination of how
 memory is allocated under Linux.
