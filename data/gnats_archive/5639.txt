Linux 2.2.14, egcs-2.91.66, i686
>Description:
I'm not quite sure this is a bug, so much as a flaw, but I would at least like to see this documented somewhere on your site.

The main problem is that when writing a module in C with the API, the module can have no globally modifiable data, since the different server threads are created using standard fork() rather than a shared fork, or pthreads.
This makes it impossible to keep any global state that can be modified on the fly (for example a database connection cache, or site configuration information in memory)
Please, please at least document this somewhere.
Thank you for your time.

>How-To-Repeat:
Yes.  simply write a module that uses a global variable, set it to 0 in the init function, and then have the handler set the variable to a random number and never reset it.
The numbers will be different, depending upon which server thread handles your request.
>Fix:
Either use pthreads, or clone() under linux, rather than fork/vfork.
