>Description:
http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/ contains the following fragment:
<CODE>
patch -s <76.kaboom.patch
</CODE>
Lynx displays only a line with "patch -s" because the "<" is not escaped as "&lt;".

[Let's see whether Lynx transmits this correctly...]
>How-To-Repeat:
Visit http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/ with Lynx, or view source.
>Fix:
Escape the "<" character
