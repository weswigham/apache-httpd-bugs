>Description:
Cut-and-paste from an unknown X terminal (maybe NCD?) cutting over a
line wrap and pasting into Netscape 3.01 "Open Url" caused a line wrap in
the middle of the URL. The URL was apparently loaded ok, but the line wrap
(I don't know if it was a CR, LF, or both) caused a line wrap in the URL
in the log file, breaking a single log entry into two lines. My log processor
dumped core as a result, leading to feelings of inadequacy, probably
justified.
>How-To-Repeat:
My X terminal doesn't cut the line wrap, so I haven't been able to 
duplicate it, but it's happened from at least two different hosts.

>Fix:
I learned to check my pointers before I run off the end of my address space,
which will at least alleviate some of the symptoms.

State-Changed-Why:
Since neither unencoded CRs nor LFs are legal in
URLs, I'm tempted to say this is a browser problem.
However, since we should be liberal in what we accept,
I'll see about protecting against this.  I really don't
see how it can be done with incurring a major performance
penalty, though, so the decision may end up being to
leave the blame on the browser and say 'don't do that.'
