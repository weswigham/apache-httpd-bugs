IRIX 6.2, IRIX C compiler
>Description:
suexec version 0.1.0 has some severe coding bugs.
First, there is a poiner variable cwd. Then a strcpy is done to this
variable without initializing it beforehand! This causes a core
dump here.
Second, the return value from chdir() is the other way around. A
correct form would be if (chdir(cwd) != 0) { error }
Third, the variable DOC_ROOT should be defined in suexec.h to be
the DocumentRoot of Apache. But in reality, this has to point
>How-To-Repeat:
to the cgi-bin directory.
Forth, the macros NNAME and NGID shall be defined but so not seem to
serve an purpose.
>Fix:
change the definition on cwd to char cwd[MAXPATHLEN+1]. Other
fixes are abvious

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 24 20:06:10 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Should all be fixed in the suexec that will be released in
1.2b5 when it comes out.  Please resubmit anything that
is still a problem at that time.
