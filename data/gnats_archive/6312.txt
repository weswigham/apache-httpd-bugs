>Environment:
We are running apche 1.3.12 and sun 5.5.1
>Description:
When we compiled the Jrun 2.3.3 module into the Apache 1.3.12 and when
we restart web server the whole webserver went slow and took more 
than a minute to load a html page and even the Jrun not start up
yet. And swap space is leaking, like we have 450m swap space and
when the server start up the swap space became 230m.
I tried using DSO instead of built-in but it still does not work.

State-Changed-Why:
If jrun has problems, you will have to take it up with the vendor 
of jrun.  We can't do anything about that...
