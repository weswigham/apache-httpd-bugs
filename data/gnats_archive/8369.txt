I spent time trawling the Google groups (it changed from dejanews months ago btw.) and the faq/bugs list and nothing, so here goes.

Quite simply, apache doesn't build and bails out early on with the errors below. I've never had problems on other platforms, but then I've used gcc. CC is preferable, and I think that building with the native compiler should work. I was suspicious that the configure process was so 'light' - it didn't really figure out anything about the system installation, and making assumptions is error prone. PHP, for example, builds fine.

>How-To-Repeat:
Well, trying to build with CC on Solaris would probably do it ;-)
>Fix:
Sure - if you don't use full autoconfiguration, at least provide documentation and directives that can be set for a Solaris build with CC.
