[Wed Aug 29 09:40:03 2001] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
[Wed Aug 29 09:40:08 2001] [notice] Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) PHP/4.0.5-dev configured -- resuming normal operations

The site has been configured to accept maxclients limit to 256
 and MaxRequestsPerChild 10000
We have tried recompiling apache also !.
The HARD SERVER LIMIT has also been set to 1024.

Still the child process spawned are not getting killed.
This is pulling down the sites performance. The no of hits is higher for this site.

Can u pls help me out in this?

Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:

How do you know it is the child-processes not exiting
that is affecting site performance and not the
other way around?  What you report looks to me
simply like symptoms of an overloaded site.

General performance problem.  No bug.

 Those error messages are not unusual on an overloaded server, and are
 not the cause of your performance problems.  Unfortunately, we are not
 able to help you with general performance issues in this forum.  Please
 try one of the user-support forums listed in the FAQ.
 
 Thanks for using Apache!
