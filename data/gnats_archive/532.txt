>Description:
I want to deny the subnets of known SPAM ISPs, for obvious reasons.  (Well,
to prevent them from spelunking for mailto: URLs.)  NETBLK-AGISCC is a good
example of a network that I suspect harbors such evildoers.  However,
NETBLK-AGISCC is a fraction of a class C, specifically: 
   205.164.64.0 - 205.164.255.255

To deny them access, I need to enter as follows:
    deny from 205.164.64
    deny from 205.164.65
    (repeat 189 times...)
    deny from 205.164.255

Obviously, this blows.
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A
>Fix:
I'd like a syntax similar to the output from InterNIC whois.  Best would be:
    deny from 205.164.64.0 - 205.164.255.255

Second best, but more appealing, is:
    deny from 205.164.64-255

State-Changed-Why:
There are a few CIDR-syntax patches floating around, and
we'll include one post-1.2.  I just moved one into
<http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/patches/1.2/cidr.patch>
You could also do this type of filtering on your router.

Thanks for using Apache.
