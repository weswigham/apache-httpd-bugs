Take a look at this snap shot of server-status I captured for out server:

     http://www.cs.umn.edu/~bentlema/snap.html

Also, I got this error message when compiling:

	mod_status.c: In function `status_handler':
	mod_status.c:244: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast


>How-To-Repeat:
Install 1.2b9 on a heavily loaded server, and watch server-status for 5 minutes,
and you will see the problem.

State-Changed-Why:
Appears to be caused by IdentityCheck On.  A workaround has
been put together and needs testing.

State-Changed-Why:

User reports that neither the identitycheck patch nor the
http_main timeout patch fixed their problem.  As I see it,
there are two remaining possibilities:

  1) Irix may have a problem with how longjmp and signal are
     used in rfc1413.c.  Try replacing

       static jmp_buf timebuf;

     with

        JMP_BUF timebuf;

     and replacing the longjmp/setjmp calls with the definitions
     used within http_main.c

  2) the IdentityCheck dependence may be a race condition being
     triggered by the extra time spent in the logger handler.
     The only way to discover this is by attaching gdb on a
     spinning process and providing us with a backtrace.

User reports that the longjmp/setjmp patch fixes the problem.
It will be included in the next release.
