>Description:
%T in LogFormat is the time it took to transfer the file, but in mod_log_config.c it sends %lld to apr_psprintf() which it doesn't understand and puts %lld in the log file. %Ld doesn't work either..

I don't think it's very necessary to have a 64 bit integer as seconds to transfer.. 300 billion years is a bit much 8)

I propose the patch below.
