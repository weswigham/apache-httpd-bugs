Suse LINUX 7
Compaq True64 Unix 4.0f
>Description:
After upgrading to 1.3.14 some customers are complaining that PDF Documents are
 not possible to load in their MSIE Browser or load only very slowly.
I could reproduce the failure with different installations  (LINUX, Compaq True64 UNIX)
and different PDF documents
after downgrading to 1.3.12 everything works fine again.

State-Changed-Why:

Could you please supply details on exactly what headers
the browser is sending, and exactly how the response
of Apache differs between the two version.  You may
need to use a network sniffer to take this off the wire.
Thanks!
