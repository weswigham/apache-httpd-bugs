>Description:
ssi are not being parsed by the server.
Httpd is configured and compiled with with mod_include as well as mod_perl, mod_ssl, mod_php3, and mod_auth_dbm.  Evertying works fine except ssi.  No compile time errors.  No errors in the errorlog.  Srm.conf is configured with:
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

After a .shtml form is loaded, viewing the source will show the ssi, unparsed..

The only clue that I have as to why this is happeneing is if I run strings on the httpd binary.  It gives me this when I search for mod_include...

encountered error in GET_CHAR macro, mod_include.

This is almost certainly a configuratoin error and not
appropriate for a bug report.

You probably don't have your Options directive set properly
for the directory in question.

 I doubt it.  I decided to compile all modules as .so instead of compiling
 them in staticly and everyting works fine.  Weird huh?
 
 It also woks fine when I compile the modules in staticly but dont include
 mod_perl.

 I double checked all the config files and they all look
 fine.
