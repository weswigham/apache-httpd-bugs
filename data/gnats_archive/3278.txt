>Organization:
>Environment:
Win98 and WinNT (SP 3)
>Description:
The cache continues to grow without any garbage collection.
At the specified time for a grabage collection, the error.log reports:
(e.g.)

[Wed Oct 21 16:56:32 1998] [error] (13)Permission denied: proxy gc: open(C:/Program Files/Apache/proxy/0)
[Wed Oct 21 16:56:32 1998] [error] (13)Permission denied: proxy gc: open(C:/Program Files/Apache/proxy/1)
[Wed Oct 21 16:56:32 1998] [error] (13)Permission denied: proxy gc: open(C:/Program Files/Apache/proxy/2)
[Wed Oct 21 16:56:32 1998] [error] (13)Permission denied: proxy gc: open(C:/Program Files/Apache/proxy/3)
etc....

Moving the cache to a directory without a long filename does *not* resolve the problem.

(none of the cache directories have any read/write/hidden/system attributes set.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache with minimal cache settings.
CacheSize 1
CacheGcInterval 0.1  

and Browse for a while!
>Fix:
sorry.
