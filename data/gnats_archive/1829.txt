>Description:
It used to be the case that cmd->path was the /directory/prefix/ of the
enclosing <Directory> or .htaccess when invoking command handlers in
modules.  mod_autoindex naively assumes that this is still the case.
It isn't any longer because regexes, <Location>, and <Files> will set
cmd->path to something which is definately not a path.

There is a lot of cruft that can be removed from mod_autoindex --
it does all this full path comparison using the apply_path element
in its dir config.  All of this is bogus... not only because the meaning
of cmd->path has changed, but also because the per_dir nesting takes
care of all of it.

Get rid of apply_path.  Make sure the merging function does the right thing
