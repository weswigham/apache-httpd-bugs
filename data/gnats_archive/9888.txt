>Description:
If I run ./configure --prefix=/opt/apache --sysconfdir=/etc/opt/apache --localstatedir=/var/opt/apache, configure ignores the last two.  Opening config_vars.mk, I see:

--snip--
abs_srcdir = /opt/apache/src/current
bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin
sbindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin
cgidir = $(datadir)/cgi-bin
logfiledir = $(localstatedir)/logs
exec_prefix = $(prefix)
datadir = $(prefix)
localstatedir = $(prefix)
mandir = $(prefix)/man
libexecdir = $(exec_prefix)/modules
htdocsdir = $(datadir)/htdocs
manualdir = $(datadir)/manual
includedir = $(prefix)/include
errordir = $(datadir)/error
iconsdir = $(datadir)/icons
sysconfdir = $(prefix)/conf
installbuilddir = $(datadir)/build
other_targets =
progname = httpd
prefix = /opt/apache
--snip--

which forces me to edit this file by hand.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download httpd-2.0.32-beta.tar.gz, tar -xzf, 
./configure --prefix=/opt/apache --sysconfdir=/etc/opt/apache --localstatedir=/var/opt/apache
