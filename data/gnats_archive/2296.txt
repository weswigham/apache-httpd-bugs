There is no form of SERIALIZED_ACCEPT defined for QNX.

USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT and USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT both seem 
to work fine.  Admittedly, I can't create much of a load.  I suspect
some form of SERIALIZED_ACCEPT would be better than none.  Based on the 
reading it seems USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT is the better choice.

If there is some way of conclusively determining appropriate functioning
or for determining which is better/faster, please let me know.

State-Changed-Why:
applied to 1.3b8-dev, thanks

btw I also defined SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT so that
the behaviour is unchanged for folks using a single socket

 That's fine, but your "Apache Performance Notes" paper states,
 
 "...that many architectures behave more 'nicely' if we serialize even the
 single socket case.  So this is actually the default in almost all cases."
 
 What suggests to you QNX should be an exception to this?  I'm not suggesting
 it should be different, I'm just curious.

 Well I know some of the QNX developers and suspect they got things right
 ;)  But really, the reason I did it, is to avoid a drastic change in
 behaviour for folks' current setups.  Right now no QNX user has has the
 locking, and presumably has become accustomed to the performance of their
 server and hasn't had to place a LockFile anywhere in the filesystem
 yet... and if they used multiple sockets, with 1.3 betas it would have
 told them their config wouldn't work.  So I just did that for the
 principle of "least surprise".
