Sorry if this is not the place to report this, but I couldn't find a specific place to do so on the web site...

When searching the download area, a PDF file of the documentation is available for download. However, there doesn't appear to be a separate HTML download of the documentation.

Those of us using Apache hosted by ISPs don't really care to download the entire source package just to get at the documentation. It would be a great service, if you woule provide the HTML format of the documentation in a separate download package.

I imagine that this could consierably reduce the traffic on your servers as well.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ should contain a 'download the full HTML documentation" link, pointing to a tarball, zip and/or RPM file.
