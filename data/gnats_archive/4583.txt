works in Netscape and IE.

http://www.mg.co.za/mg/m&amp;e/archive.htm
doesn't. They're running 1.3.4.

From a practical viewpoint, both the browsers and Apache's &amp; handling
is at fault. This will really upset the validation people...
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.mg.co.za/mg/m&e/archive.htm

or create such a badly named directory yourself with mkdir m\&e
>Fix:
Catch &amp; and other such nasties and handle them properly.

You could refuse to serve out directories with stupid characters and output an
error message, but that's not very non-US English friendly. If my name was
T&oslash; I'd want that mapped back to To-with-slashr on the local filesystem.

Bug the w3c-validator guys. They love this &amp; stuff. This is right up
their street!
