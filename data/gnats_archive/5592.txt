>Environment:
Apache/1.3.3 (Unix) Debian/GNU
HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET is set to iso-8859-1,*,utf-8 
I don't know if does it matter, but I use iso-8859-2 on my pages.
>Description:
I've an SSI problem. My service provider use Apache v1.3.3.
I checked the Apache Docs, but I wasn't found solution.
I also checked all SSI related posts on comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix,
but not found any similar post.
 
I use SSI to include menu page, header, footer, content into one page. My problem is, that SSI also inserts a similar line in the first line, like: <BASE HREF="http://server/directory/"> which makes bad
many of my links, by making the links base URL the current
directory, instead using the server root as base URL.
So <img src="/spacer.gif"> will make error 404, because the file's URL is "http://server/spacer.gif" but it will look for it in
"http://server/directory/spacer.gif"

If I insert <BASE HREF="http://server/"> into the main html document, where
the include in made, it will show following:
line 1:  <BASE HREF="http://server/directory/">  <= inserted by server
line 2:  <BASE HREF="http://server/"> <= inserted by me to override the base href inserted by server

What makes that base href inserting into the first line & why?

You can also check a real example:
http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~ggillen/index.shtml
Check the first line of Source in Netscape.
The <BASE HREF="http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~ggillen/"> was inserted by the server.
 
I'm almost sure it's an Apache feature.
I suppose there should be a solution to insert a line
into .htaccess, which makes "http://server/" the base URL.

However it might be an Apache bug, so I finally I decided to post as
bug report, too.

Please help!
Thanks in advance,
Webmaster33
>How-To-Repeat:
You can also check a real example(it's not my homepage):
http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~ggillen/index.shtml
Check the first line of Source in Netscape.
The <BASE HREF="http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~ggillen/"> was inserted by the server.
>Fix:
Should not insert the <BASE HREF="http://server/directory/"> line or there should be
a solution to insert something into .htaccess to override inserting the base href.
