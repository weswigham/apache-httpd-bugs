 Hi,
 
 I have just installed Apache 1.3.22 on Sun Solaris 7 (SunOS 5.7) and have =
 received the following errors when starting Apache:
 
 mmap: Bad file number=20
  httpd: Could not mmap memory.=20
 
 I have had a look at PR#7786 and it seems to indicate that it requires a =
 mmap.conf included in the httpd.conf.
 
 If this is so, where can I find mmap.conf?
 
 If you could assist it would be appreciated.
 
 
 
 Regards
