SunOS saarland 5.5.1 Generic_103640-05 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-20  
>Description:
We are running an Apache 1.3.0 with multiple IP-based vhosts. I noticed
that Apache logs wrong IP addresses. When I telnet from the console
to port 80 of one the vhosts IPs, Apache logs this IP in the logfile
instead of the "official" IP. I tried this with 3 vhosts and the
different vhosts logfiles contain their own IP as source request.

State-Changed-Why:

Not an Apache problem.
On most operation systems the remote address is the same
as the target address when accessing the server via
loopback.
