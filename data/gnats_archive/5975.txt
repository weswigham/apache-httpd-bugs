Apache 1.3.9 is running without any problems when I accessing files from htdocs-path. Apache is running in an intranet environment without external access.
EMX is running C:\EMX
DPATH and LIBPATH is set
PERL V5
>Description:
When I start a Perlscript such as 'Hello world' I get teh error message: "[current timestamp][ERRROR][clientadress](24)Too many open files: couldn't spawn child process. d:\apache\cgi-bin\hello.pl".
My config.sys has been set to FILES=100.
When I run the Perlscript directly it work very well.
Is there a parameter that I have to set?
