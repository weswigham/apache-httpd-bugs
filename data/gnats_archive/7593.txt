State-Changed-Why:

Thank you for the suggested path to resolve your config
error.

However, many directives in Apache take a variable number
of arguments.  It would be very misleading to allow those
to accept unquoted file names.  As with unix, any pathname
that contains a space character must be quoted.  This is
true even with the command shell dir command.

For the sake of consistency, spaces are required in every
config directive for path names containing spaces.

 Fair enough. Forget the suggestion for the bypass.
 
 At least have Apache produce an error message instead of bombing. The
 crash soaked up quite some time finding the exact cause of the error.
 There were no messages in any of the logs. I had changed a lot of lines
 in both .conf and php.ini while installing PHP and adding the extra web
 site to use PHP. Testing them by trial and error was time consuming.
 
 For a while I thought it was PHP and ISAPI.
 
 If Apache had put out a message indicating what it was attempting when
 the crash happened, I could have gone straight to the offending line in
 .conf and fixed it.
