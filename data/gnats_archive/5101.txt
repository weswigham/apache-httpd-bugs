OS: AIX 4.2.1.0
COMPILER: IBM CC 3.6.4
uanme -a: AIX webserver 2 4 000007269000
>Description:
:/usr/local/apache/bin# ./apachectl start
kill: 8926: 0403-003 The specified process does not exist.
Syntax error on line 199 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'LoadModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not inc
luded in the server configuration
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started
>How-To-Repeat:
Just compile 1.3.6 or 1.3.9 with IBM CC compiler with fixes that
you have on your site about <Directory> "problem" win IBM CC compiler
and you get this error, after compiler fixes. May be it's up again to
IBM CC?!
>Fix:
NO
