>Organization:
>Environment:
Win32 VC++ 6.0 sp3
>Description:
If the connect call fails in ap_connect and the failure is not WSAEWOULDBLOCK then no value is returned from the function.
>How-To-Repeat:
VC6 compiler points this out. Look at line 230 of apr/network_io/win32/sockets.c.
>Fix:
Write a function that maps the winsock errors onto the APR errors and call it to return an appropriate value.
