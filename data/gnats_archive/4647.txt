>Description:
in org.apache.jserv.JServ, start(), signal() & confFile are not accessible to
descendents, which makes it really hard to leverage the provided start/restart/terminate
functionality of that class when creating wrappers to include JServ in a service
framework.

Basically I am trying to include JServ support with POP.X, but JServ calls
System.exit(int) when a failure occurs, which will stop the current POP.X Node
and all of the services running in it... which is very,very bad.
>How-To-Repeat:
Hrm...
>Fix:
Make start(), signal() & confFile protected (as well as any other methods/fields
used to start/stop/reload JServ)
