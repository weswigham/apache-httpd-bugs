generic
>Description:
The mod_dir has a hardcoded limit of 23 characters for displaying file names.
This is way too short for many of the files we are dealing with.
I modified the server so that a configuration parameter can be placed in
httpd.conf as:
FileNameLength <value>
and this has worked fine for me.  This involves changing about 28 lines of code
in 4 files.  I'd like to contribute this if you are interested.  I have
#ifdef/$ifndef'ed the changes so it is easy to recognize the lines I put in.
If you could give me an e-mail address, I can attach a tar file with all the
changes.
I'll try your beta 1.3 when I have a chance.  Take care and have a great day.
