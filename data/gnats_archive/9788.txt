>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows ME; Windoews Version 3.95.3000 (USER.EXE version 4.90.3000)
Acer TravelMate 610TXV notebook PC, Interl 800MHz Pentium III
Apache installed from binary distribution (not compiled)
>Description:
After installing Apache 1.3.23 to my PC, I found that IE will always gets timeout and reporting "server is not found or DNS errer", after the dial up to MSN Internet Access is established. Similarly, Netscape will retrun with an error dialog box saying "Netscape is unable to locate the server home.netscape.com. Please check the server name and try again." Trying www.cnn.com, www.msn.com, etc. all get the same error message.

Other programs I tried inlcude: Outlook Express, FTP, Telnet. All failed to access all destinations. The same problem exists after I stopped Apache, and after I had completely removed Apache, all its files, and all its directories.

I had worked the MSN's technical support, went through everything they could think of, like reset all internet options, reset IE, rebuild dialup connection, etc. Nothing worked.

It seems that Apache must had modified a file outside of its own directories which is critical to all programs for finding application server. It seems that all those programs were directed to a shadow "localhost", even after the Apache had been removed from my PC.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I think the way to fixed could be (1) identify all files modified by Apache installation out side of its own directories, (2) narrow down by identify which ones would impact the communications of all other programs (3) zoom in on the specific file and figure out how to recover from such problem.
