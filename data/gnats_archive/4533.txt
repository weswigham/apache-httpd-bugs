uname -a gives:
IRIX64 sgi-origin2000-1 6.4 02121744 IP27
I use SGI own MIPSPro compiler cc -32 using old 32-bit libraries (I do this because
I later want to link with mod_perl and perl is in turn linked with oracle which is
not available in N32 version)
GNU make 3.77 (also tried SGI make)
Autoconf version 2.13
>Description:
Hi
make does not seem to build the src/modules/standard/mod_*.o files so it later 
fails to link everything together to src/httpd. I am not sure if this is a 
mistake by me somewhere, bug in autoconf, bug in make or bug in apache; I hope
this is the appropriate forum. I tried to make apache on a sparc-machine running
solaris and there everything worked fine.

>How-To-Repeat:
Under irix6.4 type:
cd apache_1.3.6
setenv CC "cc -32"
./configure --prefix=/usr/apache --with-perl=/usr/data/share/oracle/perl/bin/perl --disable-rule=IRIXN32 --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a --enable-shared=perl
make 
>Fix:
Well as a workaround I compiled each module with a make command, like:

cd src
foreach mod ( env log_config mime negotiation status include autoindex  dir cgi asis imap actions userdir alias access auth setenvif so)
  make modules/standard/mod_$mod.o
  cp mod_$mod.o modules/standard
end
cd ..

...but that is obvious no nice permanent solution:).
Same problem occured when trying to install mod_perl. Here lots of objects files 
were not build so I had to peek at the makefiles and compile them manually.
