RedHat Linux 6.1 kernel 2.2.12-20 GNU compiler
>Description:
I have set up the access.conf file to password protect a directory that has Microsoft Word documents and Excel files. All works fine when the client is using Office 97 but when the client is using Office 2000 the password challenge comes up every time the client tries to access a new link in that directory. When the client is using 97 the password challenge only occurs once when entering that particular directory/site. I am using .htaccess files but have tried doing the config. in access.conf as well but it still had problems.

State-Changed-When: Sun Apr  1 09:55:26 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Responsibility for caching the login information lies entirely 
with the client.  If the client doesn't behave the way you
want, you need to talk to the people that make the client.
Apache can do nothing about it and has nothing to do with it.
