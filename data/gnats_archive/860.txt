>Description:
NCSA HTTPd has maintained an option for its DNSLookups directive that was a
suggestion I made a few years ago to Brandon Long at NCSA.  Under NCSA, you
can have DNS resolving set to ON, OFF, or MINIMAL.  Minimal is like OFF for
for logging purposes (only IPs are logged), but will resolve names in any other
place where authentication based on domain names takes place (e.g., <Limit>).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
See NCSA sources for ideas on how to implement a "minimal" mode for
HostNameLookups

 We've got a proposed patch for this functionality already for 1.3-dev. 
 Thanks for bringing it up though.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache 1.3a2-dev now does the equivalent of "hostnamelookups minimal"
all the time.  The docs have been updated to note this difference.
