>Description:
When trying to use a RewriteMap-rule we get a "Couldn't connect to server"

In apache1.3.14 we had the problem that $1 wasn't expanded.
Now the problem seems to be that RewriteMap doesn't search the users-file.
The same ruleset as we try to use in 1.3.17 works fine in 1.3.12

mod_rewrite & mod_proxy is enabled
