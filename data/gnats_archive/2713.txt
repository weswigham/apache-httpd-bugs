 You are going to have to be more specific than that.  Obviously it works
 for us or we wouldn't have released it.
 
 Please cut and paste the exact command line it is trying to run and the
 exact error you get.
 
 In addition, we need to know what version of MSVC you are using.

 No I don't.  It is trivial, it has always worked just fine for me with no
 problem and is the primary method I (and, AFAIK, most Win32 Apache
 developers) use for compiling on NT.

 Huh?  You mean unless you have a development environment setup!?!  Of
 course you need to have a development environment to compile Apache!

 I have no idea of what you mean by "under DOS" since you are supposed to
 be compiling this under Windows.  You claim to be doing it under NT.  A
 command shell under NT isn't "DOS".
 
 Unless you actually provide me with the information I asked for I will
 have to close this report because it is impossible for me to do anything
 if you don't tell me what is happening.

 I'm not sure if Ben Laurie's SSL patches will work at all.
