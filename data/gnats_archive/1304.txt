I have one IP address with several DNS names (virtual hosts) and main server name
is not equal to default DNS name, so I set it by ServerName directive.
>Description:
This problem is different than discussed NameVirtualHost thing. The bug
is that main server_hostname is overwritted by first VirtualHost directive
(mod_info shows it pretty well in Hostname).

I.e. first VirtualHost found effectively replace main server ServerName by 
some alternative DNS name calculated by unknown way for me.

I find some ugly workaround, just add following
lines before your first VirtualHost, so your main server name will be
overwritten with that:

<VirtualHost your_main_server_name>
ServerName your_main_server_name
</VirtualHost>

 I'm having trouble reproducing this.  Here's the config I'm using.  Tell me
 how it differs from yours.
 
 Thanks

 It must be exiten DNS name of this host not equal to main DNS name for
 this host. F.e. if your host main name is host.com, 
 
 ServerName www.host.com
 
 > <VirtualHost 1.1.1.1>
 
 It must be not IP number but another existen DNS name of this host.
 I.e.
 <VirtuanHost host.com>
 
 > ServerName def
 
 The same here, ServerName host.com
 
 > </VirtualHost>
 >

 Now just access http://www.host.com/server-info
 you'll see Hostname/port as host.com:<port>,
 moreover, all directives like TransferLog, etc. and redirects (like
 mod_speling) use host.com instead of www.host.com now.
 
 I can send you my complete config file, it this not help.

 Ok I tried it with
 
 ServerName www.arctic.org
 
 <VirtualHost twinlark.arctic.org>
 ServerName twinlark.arctic.org
 </VirtualHost>
 
 and there was no problem.

 Do www.host.com and host.com have the same address?=20

 Yes, I talk about only *one* IP address, the same port but different DNS names.
 Here is my full config, maybe it can clarify something (it the example
 below www.nagual.pp.ru replaced by lsd.relcom.eu.net) maybe
 HostnameLookups off play role here?

Could you take a look at the new vhost docs at
www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/ and tell us if they clear
this up any?

Thanks
