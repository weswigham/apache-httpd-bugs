>Description:
It's about 4 months that I run Apache 1.3.3 on a web server. And in the error log, I have some errors like this :

--------
[Wed Jan 20 13:59:34 1999] [warn] (22)Invalid argument: setsockopt: (TCP_NODELAY
)
--------

Not a lot in fact. About 100 in four months. I don't know where it comes from ...

State-Changed-Why:
Don't worry about them.  While you give no indication of
how often they occur (and "often" only matters in terms of
hits, not time), it isn't entirely unexpected that there
could be times when a connection is established then aborted,
resulting in a failure of the setsockopt().
