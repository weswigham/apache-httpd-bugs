I am not shure about version numbers but several latest FreeBSD versions already

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, no.  FreeBSD has snprintf, Apache has ap_snprintf.  They're not
the same.  We'll continue to use our own on all platforms because
it is more reliable and easy for us to maintain cross platform
code this way.

 However, FreeBSD (BSTDIO) version is slower, resulting in ~1.5%
 performance degradation on zeusbench -k ( small file ).

 Please specify FreeBSD version you test and where I can get zeusbench.

 It is originally from http://www.zeus.co.uk/ somewhere, but I'm not sure
 if it is there any more.

 It takes some effort to conduct such tests.  Testing of just the snprintf
 implementations showed a 5-10% difference between FreeBSD (2.2) and
 ap_snprintf.  This may well be due to ap_snprintf being more specialized.
 It doesn't have all the features (eg. %q), but we can't use extra features
 anyway if they aren't portable.
 
 Unless there is a compelling reason (eg. ap_snprintf doesn't work) to use
 a system's built in snprintf, we really don't like to because it just
 introduces more hassles if it has bugs.
