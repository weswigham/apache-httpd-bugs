BUT, APPLIES TO EVERYTHING
>Description:
in httpd.conf file distributed in docs/conf directory:

AddLanguage kr .kr

this is a wrong language ID. it should be "ko" for Korean. "kr" is the COUNTRY CODE for South Korea (ROK).

it's as ridiculous as "AddLanguage jp .jp"

I remember I submitted this a year ago, but it's still wrong.
