Perl (Win32) 5.003_07 Build 313
>Description:
I can't get Perl to work on my system. It works fine under my
other server (HTTPs). All I get with Apache is an error message.

couldn't spawn child process: d:/http/scripts/foo.bar

It's in a folder that Apache knows is full of cgi scripts, it know to
execute them, but nothing happens.

I know the scripts are okay, 'cos they work with my other HTTP server.

The snag is most if not all the documentation is Unix based, and doesn't
help as much to us NT types. So when ever I look at a FAQ there is no
support, or options.
>How-To-Repeat:
Can you get Perl to run. I think everything is configured correctly,
but it don't work.

For example  http://www.darwin.ucr.edu/scripts/detect.pl

works fine if I have HTTPs running, but won't work with Apache.
>Fix:
Improve NT documentation a bit.... Remember most NT users (including me) are
use to a .exe file not source code. I want to use Apache my current server
is slow, and can't do a lot of the stuff Apache will be able to do. We need
help files.... plain text will do....

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, using CGI under Windows is not very well documented.
We'll try and get it better as we move through the
beta program. 

In your case, make sure that your perl CGI program starts
with a line like this:

  #!/bin/perl

where /bin/perl is the path to your perl executable, and
there are no spaces before or after the #! part.

Hopefully later versions of Apache will use the registry
to properly associate file extensions with script
interpreters.
