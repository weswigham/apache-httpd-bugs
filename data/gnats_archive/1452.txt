>Environment:
WinNT, Netscape Navigator Gold 3.01
>Description:
I am using the following perl (5.0) code to cause a file to be downloaded
via a CGI script:

    print "Content-Type: application/unknown\n";
    print "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$file\n\n";

    open(DOWNLOAD, $file);
    while($bytes = <DOWNLOAD>) {
        print STDOUT $bytes;
    }
    close DOWNLOAD;
  
I have also tried using read() and sysread()/syswrite() versions of the code.
1. Text files lose a character for each CRLF.
2. Binary files abort/fail/finish when they encounter ^Z (ascii 26).
>How-To-Repeat:
Download any file using similar code.  
>Fix:
1. Text files: set DOWNLOAD to binary mode transfer and STDOUT to ascii mode transfer.
   i.e. use "binmode DOWNLOAD;" after the open() command.
2. Binary files: nothing works..

 Hi Marc.
 
 Thanks for the response.  I didn't see it in the database, sorry for the
 duplicate report.
 
 There are a couple other bugs I am worried about also.  They are of a similar
 nature so I expect they are fixed in b3 as well...
 
 1. Server error on CGI's with arguments
 2. Upload problem with \r prepended to each \n
 
 Could you let me know how it is coming with these two?
 
 Thanks in advance,
  John Hawthorne
 
 PS Currently I am using a (very hacky) fix for bug #2. I would really like to
 get rid of it!
