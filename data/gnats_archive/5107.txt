>Release:        1.3.9
>Organization:
>Environment:
Intel P5
Windows NT 4.0
SP3, SP4, SP5
Using pre-compiled distribution
>Description:
When the user request a page via HTTPS, the proxy returns "Connection Refused"
error message.  This only happens with the Windows NT version of 1.3.9.  The
Linux version works with no problems.
>How-To-Repeat:
Fails on all HTTPS urls so try any.
>Fix:
I'm assuming that this is a code problem and it looks related to some
of the other bugs from previous versions.
