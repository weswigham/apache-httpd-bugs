Erm... how is nicing them going to do anything that useful?
I mean, they will still be sitting around doing whatever
bad things they are doing.  They shouldn't "send the system
spiraling down to its death" anyway, and if they do then there
is a bug in your OS.

Otherwise, wouldn't appropriate settings of RLimit* make
much more snese?

Very broken mailer bounced the response:

<bdraco@darkorb.net>:
209.201.10.102 failed after I sent the message.
Remote host said: 550 Your E-Mail is redundant.  You cannot send E-Mail to yours
elf (marc@apache.org).


Completely nonsensical, since it shouldn't be parsing the
To: header and trying to send to the recipients listed there,
plus why should it care if I'm sending myself email?

I'll try forwarding it manually, but if this mailer keeps acting up,
the effort is just far too great to try to jump through hoops.

 Please fix your horribly broken mailer.  Not only should it NEVER be
 parsing for recipients to send to in the To: line, but  it is pretty
 dumb to refuse to let people send mail to themself.
 
 If it continues to act up, I won't have any choice but to close the PR due
 to impossibility of communication.

 Hi. This is the qmail-send program at hyperreal.org.

 This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

Broken mailer that doesn't accept all sorts of legit mail,
no choice but to close PR.

 Good grief.  Talk about a really broken mailer.  Lame.  Really lame.  It
 won't accept mail from domains that only have a MX record.  
 
 Even lamer is that I can't check what software they are running because
 someone thought it would be cute to make it say:
 
 220 FTP server (Version wu-2.4.2-academ[BETA-15](1) Wed, 11 Nov 1998 12:25:58 -0500 (EST)) ready.
 
 (well, ok, I know it is smail anyway, but...)
