>Environment:
Ultrix 4.4 0 RISC
using gcc
>Description:
We use an embedded cgi execution to run a counter.  The counter script is
executed by all documents in the ~user hierarchy, but when called from
a file in the DocumentRoot hierarchy, is interpreted only as a comment.

This did not occur when using v1.1.1.  
>How-To-Repeat:
At http://www.cs.earlham.edu/index.html, view the source and you will see
the embedded CGI as a comment.  
At http://www.cs.earlham.edu/~cem/homepage.html you will see a counter at
the bottom of the page that calls the same script with the same exact syntax.
>Fix:
I don't; if the server isn't even flinching at an embedded exec statement and
is just spitting it out as a comment, seems like there's something pretty
wrong there

State-Changed-Why:
Your server is probably misconfigured.  Check all your
config files for the Options lines applying to your
DocumentRoot and be sure that Includes is enabled for
it.
