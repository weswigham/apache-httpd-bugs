>Description:
When using mod_include to execute a cgi in a .shtml page with the following content:

<html>
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi/env.cgi?name=Don"-->
</html>     

The following error is generated at the browser:
[an error occurred while processing this directive] 

The follwing entry is generated in the log file:
invalid CGI ref "/cgi/env.cgi?name=Don" in /www/amplespace/public_html/test/index.shtml

When you execute the same shtml without the passed parameter everything works fine.. ie:

<html>
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi/env.cgi"-->
</html>     

Using #include virtual is a work around, but is not really appropriate.
>How-To-Repeat:
Configure a standard 1.3.9 apache w/ MOD_INCLUDE and put in the following into the config file to activate cgi & ssi:

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
AddType text/html .shtml 
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

Also include in the <Directory> tag for the html home dir:
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI Include

 This isn't a bug.  That is the way things work.  "exec cgi" takes the file
 named and executes it as a CGI.  It passes any query string from the
 original page.  That is the way SSIs were originally created, and Apache
 follows that.  
 
 Since it makes little sense, however, to have special cases for CGIs,
 Apache offers "include virtual" which takes any URI on the server (could
 be a CGI, a file, a module, etc.) and handles it without the odd semantics
 that exec cgi has.
