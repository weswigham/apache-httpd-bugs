>Description:
I posted this description on ciwsu on 29/6/98

Since installing Apache 1.3.0 on my solaris 2.4 server, I have been
getting complaints of slow downloading on my main page - it's a very
straightforward compilation, no third party addins etc.

It seems that most users mention the rotating sun which is

http://www.veritas.org.sg/images/icons/logoicon.gif

On checking it seems that apache is indeed reluctant to serve this
file properly. It does sometimes download but very often it will just
hang waiting for it. If you get it, try <SHIFT><RELOAD>. I've tried
Netscape 3.01, 4.05 and IE4

I have also copied it to
http://www.veritas.org.sg/images/icons/abbbb.gif and to 
http://www.veritas.org.sg/~twa/logoicon.gif

The other files in that directory all seem to load fine. Try any of
them :-) Could anybody confirm this observation and give me a clue on
where to look for a solution.

 Solaris 2.4 is ancient and, as shipped originally, has many problems with
 the TCP stack.  Do you have Sun's latest 2.4 patch cluster installed?

 Yes, if you haven't ever installed any patches or haven't updated them for
 a while, this could well be the problem, plus it is probably causing other
 problems and slowdowns you don't even know about.

 Rather stupidly I decided to watch World Cup football and install the
 suggested patches remotely from the Dec 97 patch CD which happened to be
 sitting in the cdrom drive (It's now 6am Sunday)
 
 After a few reboots and forced installations all are now in and yes, thank
 you, it seems to have fixed the gif download problem.

 Can I just add, whether for the database or not, that I did need to
 recompile apache, otherwise I was getting a SIGTERM on startup
