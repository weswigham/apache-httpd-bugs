>Environment:
RedHat Linux 6.0/Kernel 2.2.10/egcs 2.91.66
>Description:
If the Satisfy directive is used without a Require directive, the result is an internal server error. Nothing is sent to the error log. Instead, a line of this form is logged to the access log:

12.21.6.40 - - [18/Aug/1999:00:28:41 -0400] "GET /guest_login/index.html HTTP/1.1" - 536 "http://www.censored.com/fla/index.html" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Windows NT; DigExt)"

As shown, no numeric code is given.

The result is the same if the config error is done in the conf file or in an .htaccess file. apachectl configtest doesn't report a problem, and neither does the server on load.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply create an .htaccess file and use directives like this:

order deny,allow
allow from env=VALID_REFERER
deny from all
satisfy any
>Fix:
Have the server recognize it as a configuration error and warn (if in the config file), or log to the error log descriptively (if used in .htaccess).
