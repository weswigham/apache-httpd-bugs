>Description:
Apache starts properly, but the second I try to make a connection to it, it dies leaving nothing but:

[error] (22)Invalid argument: shmctl() could not set segment #2306

or

semctl(IPC_SET): Invalid argument

in the error log. I compiled Apache 1.3.19 + PHP 4.0.5 + mod_ssl 2.8.3_1.3.19 + OpenSSL 0.9.6a as follows:

Apache 1.3.19:

./configure --enable-module=ssl --enable-shared=ssl --enable-module=php4 --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a

PHP:

./configure --with-apache=.... --enable-bcmath --enable-exif --enable-track-vars --with-mysql --with-xml

mod_ssl:

./configure --with-apache=....

OpenSSL:

./config --prefix=....

This, of course, all in the correct order...
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
No idea, I've searched high and low for this bug on the Internet. All I can find is the 'User/Group' suggestion in the .conf and people reporting a similar problem with IRIX. Neither works.
