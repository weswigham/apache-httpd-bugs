>Environment:
mkLinux DR2
>Description:
dlfcn.h is missing n mkLinux DR2, but not DR3.
>How-To-Repeat:
"make" on a DR2 mkLinux system.
>Fix:
I'm not sure how to detect the differences between any two releases of mkLinux, since uname -a shows them identical except for linux kernel version.
But I can give someone an account on one of each system if it helps.
Better, I'd think, would be to check for the presense of the file if the script thinks it should exist.

State-Changed-Why:
This has also been reported in #2434 and 2377.  It's a
problem in the Linux distribution.  If the OS fails to
include one of its header files it's hardly reasonable
for applications to all have to work around it.  Please
see those other PRs.  Thanks for using Apache!
