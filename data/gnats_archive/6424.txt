>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux kernel 2.2.14
egcs-2.91.66
>Description:
if we specify --suexec-docroot=DocRoot, whenever Apache executes something in DocRoot, it should be SUEXECed but actually, not.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --prefix=/home/apache --enable-suexec --suexec-docroot=/home/clubtest
while DocumentRoot "/home/clubtest" in /home/apache/conf/httpd.conf
and user1's home is /home/clubtest/user1

http://myserver/~user1/ls.sh.cgi is SUEXECed
http://myserver/user1/ls.sh.cgi is NOT SUEXECed, though it should be the hierarchy (aside from UserDirs) that can be used for suEXEC behavior.


>Fix:
I have no idea for now.

State-Changed-Why:
There are two issues here.  The configuration in suexec that
you talk about simply tells it that it _can_ execute things in
that docroot.  As per the docs, it will not use suexec for 
non-userdir things unless you have a "user"/"group" directive
in the vhost they are being executed for.
