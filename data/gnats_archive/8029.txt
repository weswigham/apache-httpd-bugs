>Environment:
It's on a Debian 2.2r3, kernel 2.2.19. On a SparcStation 5. 
>Description:
Apache works fine on .html, .php3 files, and, in a more general manner, every kind of text file.
But binary files (.jpg, .gif, .tgz, .zip, .....) are sent very, very slowly to the client (about 1/2kB per second), and sometimes even never finish to be sent (until client's timeout, nothing appears).
Error-log doesn't say anything, access-log says apache served the file, and nothing "moves" on the server (load average staying at 0.00). 
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, I have no permanent internet connection, the machine is only locally available...
