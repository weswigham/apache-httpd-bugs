>Description:
Apache configured/built as per:

With "ExtendedStatus On" in httpd.conf, Apache/2.0.28 works but 2.0.32 core
dumps;  error_log reports:

  seg fault or similar nasty error detected in the parent process

Running GDB over the core file reports:

#0  0x6b0dc in ap_update_child_status_from_indexes (child_num=0, thread_num=0,
    status=1, r=0x0) at scoreboard.c:415
415             if (status == SERVER_READY || status == SERVER_DEAD) {
(gdb) backtrace
#0  0x6b0dc in ap_update_child_status_from_indexes (child_num=0, thread_num=0,
    status=1, r=0x0) at scoreboard.c:415

#3  0x5d0c0 in ap_mpm_run (_pconf=0x5, plog=0x128680, s=0x17d6c0)
    at prefork.c:1021
#4  0x62b1c in main (argc=1562304, argv=0xe8600) at main.c:501

The (for now) work-around is to disable extended status reporting - Apache is
then able to successfully fire-up and start answering queries.

Basic Apache compilation/configuration information:

# ./httpd -V
Server version: Apache/2.0.32
Server built:   Mar 11 2002 23:05:40
Server's Module Magic Number: 20020128:0
Architecture:   32-bit
Server compiled with....
 -D APACHE_MPM_DIR="server/mpm/prefork"
 -D APR_HAS_MMAP
 -D APR_USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZE
 -D APR_USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZE
 -D APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD
 -D AP_HAVE_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS
 -D HTTPD_ROOT="/opt/cwis"
 -D SUEXEC_BIN="/opt/cwis/bin/suexec"
 -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG="logs/error_log"
 -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="conf/httpd.conf"

Any additional information required?
>How-To-Repeat:
No URL necessary - Apache doesn't even manage to start-up in the first place.
>Fix:
As above - the temporary work-around is to disable extended status reporting;
longer-term, however, this is an unacceptable "solution".

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed

State-Changed-When: Wed Mar 13 08:37:46 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:
I was able to readily reproduce the problem with vanilla 2.0.32 on Solaris, but the problem is no longer present in the current code.

I think that these three patches, committed after 2.0.32, are sufficient for solving the problem:

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apr/shmem/unix/shm.c.diff?r1=1.14&r2=1.15

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apr/include/apr_general.h.diff?r1=1.65&r2=1.66

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apr/memory/unix/apr_pools.c.diff?r1=1.154&r2=1.155

(I have not verified that they are the only post-2.0.32 fixes needed; it seems simpler/safer to me to grab CVS HEAD
if you want to test the fix before the next release of
Apache 2.0.)

Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache 2.0!
