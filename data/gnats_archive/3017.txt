State-Changed-Why:

Does this occur when a) you don't use the https scheme or
b) don't include mod_ssl?

Comment-Added:

If this only occurs when you use SSL, and not with the base
Apache code, then there is nothing we can do for you.  Please
try removing mod_ssl from your configuration and trying that,
or accessing a page on your server that doesn't involve SSL.
If your server does nothing but SSL, please contact the
people who support the module.

 This was traced to viewing a site that has RSA encryption and then pointing
 the browser immediatly afterwards to an IDEA based SSL server.
 I have been able to replicate this error each time. 
 Accessing each type of secure server separately works OK thou. The browser is
 obviously carrying over information from the first SSL.
