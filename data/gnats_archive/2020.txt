>Description:
When compiling PHP for Apache 1.3b5, compilation fails:

gcc -O2 -I.   -I/export/home/Dragon/apache_1.3b5/src/include -I/export/home/Dragon/apache_1.3b5/src/os/unix     -I/usr/local/include/mysql     -g -Wall     -c language-parser.tab.c -o language-parser.tab.o
In file included from /export/home/Dragon/apache_1.3b5/src/include/httpd.h:66,
                 from parser.h:140,
                 from language-parser.y:49:
/export/home/Dragon/apache_1.3b5/src/include/ap.h:64: conflicting types for `vsnprintf'
/usr/include/stdio.h:265: previous declaration of `vsnprintf'
make: *** [language-parser.tab.o] Error 1
>How-To-Repeat:
Build MySQL 3.21.27 -> /usr/local 
Extract PHP, Apache to common src directory

Configure PHP3RC with:
./configure --with-apache=../apache_1.3b5 --with-mysql
>Fix:
No, though I had no problems compiling with Apache 1.2.5 && PHP. Will try Apache 1.2.6 next. Will snoop the newsgroups and look for alternate entries in the Apache Bug Report DB, PHP Bug report DB

State-Changed-Why:
We really can't do anything about problems with third
party modules.  This appears  to be a conflict between
the PHP version and Apache code.  Talk to the PHP
people.

 OK, it was FYI anyways. PHP just released 3RC#2, that works with Apache
 1.2.6. Seems like the problems with PHP -> Apache 1.3B5 are in the PHP
 Makefile, as it seems to be skipping the bison routine up front.
 
 Thanks for your reply.
