Apache 1.3.6 and JServ 1.0
RedHat Linux 6.0 with updates and kernel 2.2.12
JSDK 2.0 and JDK 1.17B
>Description:
It appears that a servlet's destroy method is only called when the ServletManager
re-initializes a servlet.  I've verified this using the log() API call and have
also tried to write to my own log file.  This is not serious for simple servlets, but
is more of a concern for servlets that rely on using cached resources to improve
performance or want to save state before being destroyed.  Looking through the bug
database suggests that this problem may have been around as early as 1.3.4, but
it is not documented as such.

Further testing shows that destroy() is called when you update the servlet's
class file when autoreload.classes=true.
>How-To-Repeat:
Make sure autoreload.classes=true in zone file.

Add init() and destroy() methods to Hello.java example.  Add a log() call to
the init() and destroy() methods, recompile, and run servlet from browser.
View log file to see init's log() message.  Restart and/or stop Apache.
View log again and message from destroy is NOT in the log.

Re-run servlet from browser and see init's log() message in log file.  Recompile
Hello.java and re-run servlet from browser.  View log to see that destroy() is
called a few messages after the "Re-initing ServletManager servlet" message.
>Fix:
If the destroy method is really being called on server start or restart,
perhaps the log needs to be flushed.  However, the fact that I cannot write to
my own log file suggests that this may not be the case.

Perhaps this is a timing issue?

 With full jserv logging turned on, the last messages printed from
 mod_jserv are as follows during a server stop or restart:
 
 ... jserv_watchdog:(...) watchdog_cleanup()
 ... Apache Module was cleaned-up
 
 I'm not an expert in mod_jserv and its source code, but it appears that
 the problem is related to mod_jserv's load balancing logic and/or an
 improper configuration on my part.  Adding additional log statements to
 jserv_watchdog.c revealed that cfg->shmfile was null inside
 watchdog_cleanup() causing it to return without doing anything --
 further suggesting that ApJServShmFile was not set in the config file
 (which it was not).  Although, LOAD_BALANCE is #defined in jserv.h by
 default, no load balancing statements appear in my jserv config files. 
 (BTW, when I attempted to comment out the #define LOAD_BALANCE statement
 in jserv.h and rebuild, I got compile errors.  I believe
 jserv_cfg_shmfile() in mod_jserv.c needs to be wrapped using #ifdef
 LOAD_BALANCE ... #endif preprocessor statements.)
