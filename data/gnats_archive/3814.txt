Linux 2.0.36 (Pentium)
Apache 1.3.3
PHP, Perl, ASP, and Frontpage patches added.
>Description:
Server has been running great over the last 2 months or so... Today we added a virtual host to "httpd.conf" and added AuthConfig to "access.conf" -- we did not touch srm.conf at all.

When we went to restart the server, it would not start and gave us this error:

Syntax error on line 46 of /usr/local/apache/etc/srm.conf:
AddIcon is improperly configured internally (server bug)
./apachectl startssl: httpd could not be started

Line 46 is:
AddIcon /icons/binary.gif .bin .exe
>How-To-Repeat:
Its a configuration problem of some sort. The internal error should give some idea.
>Fix:
I'd like to confirm whether or not the error is normal. It appears to be a flag of some sort hard coded in the source to when an unexpected un-accounted for condition occurs.

State-Changed-Why:
Uh yeah that's odd... pretty much impossible too... unless
somehow your executable was corrupted.  bad ram maybe?
Does it still occur with 1.3.6?

 I think it had to do with putting this in my srm.conf:
 
 ScriptAlias /icons/
 
 Instead of:
 
 Alias /icons/
 
 I managed to fix it afterwards, but the error message was very vague and
 didn't give me an idea why it was happening.
 
 If you try it, you might get the same error. (ie:
 Use ScriptAlias instead of Alias for the /icons/ directory).
