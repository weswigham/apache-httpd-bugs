If Apache is used as a proxy-server: 
"ProxyRequests Off" results in "forbidden, you do not have permission ..."
Apache as a web-server is working fine (ProxyPass-Statements)
--> Apache, Version 1.3.9 
"ProxyRequests Off": Instead off the forbidden-message, all requests are sent to my default-site. My question is: How can I configure Apache to get the forbidden-message for the reasen that Apache is used as a proxy-Server!
Thank´s a lot!
