>Description:

A mod might convert Apache into a global file system in the style of
AFS. Currently, there is no freely available system to do this.

No, this isn't really a bug. I'm sending this via the bug report form because you suggested suggestions
be sent here (I looked for a general feedback address but found none and didn't
want to send this to a random person on the contributor list.)

Below is the request for developers for the QFS, a proposed free global file system in
the general style of the commercial AFS for use with Queue load-balancing system.

Apache does some things that are file-server-like and it supports
authentication and file access control lists. (I'm not sure if the http protocol supports random
access to files, but this can be added....) It does somethings different,
such as pay attention to file name extensions, ignore files & named pipes, perform
internal server file caching, etc., but these could turned off.

It makes some sense to do this in the context of a WWW protocol, for example,
"/www/gfs/net/linux/home/bob" might the home directory mount point for bob@linux.net, whose clients
would receive an access cookie upon login or job sumbission via Queue. "/www/http/net/linux/www"
might be the home page for "www.net.linux".

Since the goal is to put together a global filesystem as quickly as possible
using existing systems and at the user level, Apache deserves consideration as
a model for a user-level file server.

In fact, it might be easy to write a mod for Apache to do much of what we
are interested in.

Here is the announcement which I sent out earlier to various newsgroups and lists.

If you know of developers who might be interested, please forward this message
to them.

Thank you.

>How-To-Repeat:

Try running your shell scripts and jobs on another random Internet system of
the same architecture.

Something will break because your home directory filesystem cannot be
safely and securely exported with existing free software.

Maybe you could copy it, but that would waste disk space and other resources.
You'd have to keep the two copies in sync or convince the sys adm to cross
mount the systems. Also, you might have to copy /usr/local/bin and stuff like that, too.
It's tricky.
>Fix:

Write a mod or help us write a mod. ;-)

You're probably better off talking about stuff like this
on the new-httpd mailing list.  More folks read that.
