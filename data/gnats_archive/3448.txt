I'm trying to configure Apache on my server. I start the httpd daemon. When I
try to access http://localhost/ from the server I get the following message:
You don't have permission to access / on this server.

How do I fix this?

State-Changed-Why:

This database is for reporting bugs in the code, not for
basic configuration issues.  Check your error log to
find out why access was denied; you either have incorrect
permissions set, or you need the following in your
DocumentRoot <Directory> container:

 Order deny,allow
 Allow from all

Please refer to these directives in the documentation at
<http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_access.html>, and
ask further configuration questions on the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix USENET newsgroup.
