SunOS 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise
gcc version 2.8.0
>Description:
I have compiled apache in /opt/apache/src with no errors, and a few warnings
from mod_imap.c in function 'imap_handler'.  I do not believe the warnings are
the problem.

Every time I try to run:  /opt/apache/src/httpd -f /opt/apache/conf/httpd.conf
it tells me:  getpeername: Socket operation on non-socket
              getsockname: Socket operation on non-socket
              Error getting local address

I see where the error is located in the source, but I am not sure why it is
happening, since there were no compilation errors.
>How-To-Repeat:
Yep, every time I go to start it up.
>Fix:
Nope..

 Yes, I did...  sorry...

 At first it was not starting at all and I was getting no errors on the
 screen, so I browsed the .conf files and changed the servertype thinking
 that was my problem.  I then noticed that the error log entry stated that
 it was unable to set the gid.  I never changed the servertype back to
 standalone after I fixed the gid problem.
 
 Thanks for your time...
