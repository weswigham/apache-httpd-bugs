Redhat Linux, based on 4.2

>Description:
Earlier versions used to kill deadlocked CGI-scripts after some minutes.
After upgrading to this version, this behavior stoped.
I found an article describing that the TemeOut directive applies to this also,
but it is 300, and it doesn't work.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm not sure what you mean by "deadlocked" ... ?

If a timeout occurs the connection to the CGI is closed.
The timeout won't happen if the CGI writes anything, unless
the client never reads it.

Do you have a small example we can reproduce the problem with?

If I test CGIs that just sleep forever the timeout works
fine.

 Hi!
 
 Thanks for answering my question, but it's already eliminated
 by using fcgi. So I even don't remember the situation,
 but I'm sure it was a problem for me, having some deadlocked cgi's
 runing for hours until I kill them. Probably they did write anything,
 but in this case they should killed when the client disconnects,
 shouldn't they?
 
 Anyway, mod_fcgi is a great solution, we have a very overloaded server,
 with normal cgi the processor load was about 50 sometimes,
 now it's always under 5. According to my benchmarks the server
 answers about 20-30 times faster now (without load).
 
 Thanks anyway!
