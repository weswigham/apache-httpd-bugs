>Description:
Every few days, 1 or more webservers goes nuts with 1 or more processes consuming an entire processor. stack dumps (via pstack) make this appear to be a recursive regex call that goes nuts (although this is the COMPLETE stack dump - so it doesn't appear to recurse many times):

I use a few relatively simple rewrite rules that activate on almost all URLs on a site that gets millions of hits a day. This has been going on for a year and a half, but sporadically enough that we've never pursued it. Sometimes it disappears for months, then occurs every day for weeks.

At one time, I dumped core into gdb and debugged quite a few processes on different machines to check the URL getting passed into regexec - they were all VERY normal image or html calls that we process hundreds of thousands of times a day. I'm lost. I can't find any references to this problem anywhere.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have no idea - but it repeats for me regularly. I'm willing to do the legwork to help track it down, but I'm lost at this point.
>Fix:
nope.

 It isn't hard to write rewrite rules that may get into loops.
 
 Your bug report is basically useless as it is, because you have told
 us nothing about your configuration.
