>Release:        1.3.1
>Environment:
AIX 4.2.1, xlC 3.1.4
>Description:
os.c includes a declaration of dlerror as char * from /usr/include/dlfcn.h.
This clashes with the declaration in os-aix-dso.c as const char *.

>How-To-Repeat:
run Configure and make, compilation of os.c fails.
>Fix:
Check whether dl functions in AIX 4.2.1 (libdl.a) can be used and ignore
os-aix-dso.c for AIX4.2.1. If that is impossible declare function consistently.

State-Changed-Why:
Committed patch to cvs to fix this problem.  For now, we should use
Apache's DSO support rather than the native AIX DSO support.
