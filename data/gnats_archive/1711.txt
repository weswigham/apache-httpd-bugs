>Description:
I have been previously using Apache 1.2.4 with no problems with respect to 
hostname based <VirtualHost> directive.  

I had it set-up such that the httpd.conf main-default server/document root
would be hit by referencing http://gomer.mlink.net as-is 
(/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs).

Additional aliases (pointed to my single IP address 205.236.183.5) defined
elsewhere on the net (e.g. www.linux-efnet.ml.org and www.linux.efnet.ca)
were defined under separate <VirtualHost>...</VirtualHost> directives at
the bottom of my httpd.conf. 

Upon upgrading to 1.3b3, the server seems to ignore the default definitions
outside of the first <VirtualHost> directive and ALWAYS choose the first
directive.  I tried to get around this by adding a <VirtualHost gomer.mlink.net>
and <VirtualHost www.linux.efnet.ca> as well as the main-default but no
matter what URL I use (http://gomer.mlink.net or http://www.linux.efnet.ca),
it always goes to the very first <VirtualHost... entry>.

>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot leave 1.3b3 running without irritating users so an example is 
impossible at this time.

 I assume you've read the new virtual host documentation as mentioned in
 the upgrading_to_1_3.html documentation right? 
 
 If not then please visit http://www.apache.org/docs/upgrading_to_1_3.html
 and you'll probably find out what's wrong.  Specifically you should be
 reading the vhost docs at http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/. 
 
 There's also probably an error message in your error_log that should
 provide a clue.

 Yes, I read everything in the upgrading and the new vhosts documentation.
 Everything looked great BUT it just didnt work great.  However. :-)  I got
 frustrated just after posting my report and decided to delete all the
 VirtualHost directives and start from scratch (about 5-6 to redo).  I must
 have had a typo in there somewhere cause now it is working fine with both
 names and IP:<port> vhosts).
 
 Sorry for wasting your time.  And amazing response time at that :-)B
