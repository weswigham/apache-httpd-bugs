Apache 1.3.4 from the .exe installer
Jserv 1.0Beta2 for Apache 1.3.4
>Description:
I installed both Apache and Jserv from the .exe files... http://localhost/jserv/ worked fine.
I edited the servlet zone file to have repository="c:\java\jsdk2.0\examples" so I could test the example servlets in that directory, but cannot get any of the servlets to run, instead I get a 500 error, internal server error.

I can run these servlets from the servletexec, so I know they work.
