>Release:        1.3.9
>Organization:
>Environment:
Win32, binaries obtained from Apache.org
>Description:
No entries in the error log indicated a problem, but for some reason, Apache
1.3.9 will not answer any requests by IE5.0.  The request isn't denied, either,
Apache just sits there and IE says, "Waiting for reply..." until I shutdown the
server.  I have never successfully gotten a page to show up in 1.3.9.

Don't know if it's related, but 1.3.9 takes two "apache.exe -k shutdown" commands before it will actually shutdown.

I'm using the same config files as from my 1.3.6 install (which works fine after I reinstalled it over 1.3.9), and thought a difference between conf's might be the problem, but didn't see any drastic changes or any special notes in the readmes regarding such.

PC Stats:
Celeron 400mHz --> 450mHz
256MB RAM
Win98 w/ IE5.0
Binaries obtained as-is from the Apache site.
>How-To-Repeat:
There's nothing to observe from a client's side.  (Or the server side either, apparently.)
