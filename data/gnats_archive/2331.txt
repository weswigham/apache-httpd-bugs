>Environment:
Windows NT patch 3
>Description:
On 1.3b7 CreateProcess is used to create a windows process in place of
spawnle - the environment array passed to it is invalid for this function - 
as a consequence NO environmental variables are passed to the cgi script.

CreateProcess can also be passed the directory name that it should use as its
working directory - this should used as the call to chdir has been removed for
WIN32
>How-To-Repeat:
Adjust this script for the pathname of the perl executable

Note that you can run it from the dos prompt (where it displays 
the environmental variables), or from the browser - where it doesn't

#!d:/NTRESKIT/Perl/PERL.EXE
$|=1;  #flush on
# print the http header
printf "HTTP/1.0 200: OK\n";
printf  "Content-Type: text/html \n\n";
printf "<html><body bgcolor=#FFFFFF>\n";
#print the environmental variables
for $key (sort keys %ENV){
	print "$key=$ENV{$key}<br>\n";
}
printf  "</body>\n";
printf  "</html>\n";
1;
>Fix:
util_script.c

The following will make the utility work correctly and demonstrates the correct
use of CreateProcess - but does not make use of Apache utilities, that to 
determine a directory name, and allocate memory.

replace 

	if (CreateProcess(NULL, pCommand, NULL, NULL, TRUE, 0, env, NULL, &si, &pi)) {
	  pid = pi.dwProcessId;
	  /*
	   * We must close the handles to the new process and its main thread
	   * to prevent handle and memory leaks.
	   */ 
	  CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
	  CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
with

    {
        char *dirname=strdup(r->filename);
        char *x = strrchr(dirname,'/');
        char *envblk=0;
        int j=0;
        if(x){*x='\0';
        } else {
            *dirname=0;
        }
        /* calculate length */
        for (i = 0; env[i]; ++i){
            j+=strlen(env[i])+1;
        }
        envblk=calloc(1,j+4);
        for (i = 0,j=0; env[i]; ++i){
            strcpy(envblk+j,env[i]);
            j+=strlen(env[i])+1;
        }


/*	if (CreateProcess(NULL, pCommand, NULL, NULL, TRUE, 0, env, NULL, &si, &pi)) {*/	
	if (CreateProcess(NULL, pCommand, NULL, NULL, TRUE, 0, envblk, dirname, &si, &pi)) {
	  pid = pi.dwProcessId;
	  /*
	   * We must close the handles to the new process and its main thread
	   * to prevent handle and memory leaks.
	   */ 
	  CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
	  CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
	}
    free (dirname);
    free (envblk);
    }
