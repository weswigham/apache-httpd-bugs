Linux lathe.thebook.com 2.2.14am #1 SMP Thu Apr 6 12:25:00 EDT 2000 i686 

System is Redhat 6.0 w/ kernel 2.2.14 SMP.  Dual P II 300, 256 meg ram
we are running 20 servers at start up ( 5 minspare/20 maxspare
- 80 max clients).

After compiling the new apache with the following mods:
httpd -l
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c

  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_setenvif.c
  mod_php3.c
suexec: enabled; valid wrapper /usr/local/etc/httpd/bin/suexec
>Description:
Using a simple perl script which just prints the $ENV variables, we are
calling ab with :
    ab -n10000 -c10 http://torch/cgi-bin/thebook/printenv.pl
--
Apache 1.3.12 runs much slower - only 26 requests/second,
compared to 168 requests/second under 1.2.5.

We are a web hosting provider with fairly busy servers and this is significant
enough to 'scare' us.  Performance on static HTML was about the same.

Full details below:

>How-To-Repeat:
See above, just compare 1.2.5 with 1.3.12 on call printenv cgi script.

The time difference it SO large, there must be something crazy going on --
but could really hurt apache in review benchmarks!
>Fix:
We are getting ready to do a profile and see where all the time is
being spent. Because the difference is so large, something should stand out.

 Did you see and/or respond to my followup to your post in 
 comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix?
 
 Can you show me exactly what CGI you are using?
