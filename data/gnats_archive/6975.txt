>Description:
Here is the end of the output from the make which I am running from the src directory:

gcc -c  -I./os/unix -I./include   -DHPUX11 -DUSE_HSREGEX  buildmark.c
In file included from include/ap_config.h:959,
                 from buildmark.c:58:

Stop.


When I do a strings -a on the src/ap/libpa.a I find __builtin_va_start in there.

Any suggestions?
