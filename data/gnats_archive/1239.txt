 Could you be more specific about how it's not compliant with the
 specification?

State-Changed-Why:
It's generally not a good idea to track draft standards
too closely, since that can skew you from the installed
base and cause additional problems if/when the standards
are modified.  (There's a reason they're called "draft,"
y'know.)

However..  Please let us know in what way(s) Apache 1.3b2
doesn't match the draft, and we'll consider whether it's
appropriate for us to change its behaviour.
