>Description:
If you do a server-status immediately after restarting the server, a huge 
number is displayed for the milliseconds required to process most recent 
request.

Below is a snippet from an actual server-status page:

Server uptime: 3 seconds
Total accesses: 0 - Total Traffic: 0 kB
CPU Usage: u0 s0 cu0 cs0
0 requests/sec - 0 B/second - 
1 requests currently being processed, 2 idle servers

Srv PID   Acc   M CPU  SS Req        Conn Child  Slot  Client        VHost            Request
0-9 25382 0/0/0 W 0.00 3  1193254549 0.0  0.00   0.00  134.169.10.45 www.euroavia.org GET /server-status HTTP/1.0

When I reload the page the "Req" number is back down to something reasonable.
>How-To-Repeat:
Restart your server, then immediately request a server-status page.
>Fix:
I'd guess that some variable is not initialized properly (???).
