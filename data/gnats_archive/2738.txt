>Description:
Compiler error:
I had to change the file os-aix-dso.c and change the definition of dlerror from
   const char *dlerror(void);
to
   char *dlerror(void);
because of an incompatibility with a header file.

Execution error;
I had to change the file http_core.c line 1093 from
   if (cmd->cmd->name != cmd->end_token) {
to
   if (strcmp(cmd->cmd->name, cmd->end_token)) {
to make matching of tags work.

Other than that, things work nicely.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the report; there is already a report on the
first one and it will be tracked under that report.

As for the second one, there is another report on it.
It appears to be a compiler bug with some versions of AIX's compiler;
it is beeing looked at.
