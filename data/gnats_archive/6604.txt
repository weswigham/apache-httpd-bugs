Win 95/98/NT4/2000
Apache 1.3.12
ActivePerl 5.6 build 618
MySQL 3.23.24
DBI 1.13 and 1.14 tried both
DBD-MySQL 1.2200 and 1.2214 tried both
>Description:
When running a CGI on Apache 1.3.12 it just stops sending data, I have tested the script on Xitami Web Server and on Command line and have verified the output is complete from those but when running on apache it runs but just stops sending data and eventually times out with no error.  I have reproduced the problem on multiple machines and have attempted rewriting the script in different ways and appears to be some form of a buffer/memory issue....

One thing I have noticed is that when it times out, it is in the exact same place each time which is what leads me to beleive the buffer/memory issue. CGI reports no error nor does apache but it stops mid output like in the middle of a word, ex. a </font> like </fo

You can contact me if you need to.  I will help out any way I can reproducing the problem for you....

>How-To-Repeat:
http://208.191.217.78/cgi-bin/test3.cgi
if you browse to the above location you will see the problem...
it is the same 35 entries repeated 4 times in the database just with 4 different IDs.

http://208.191.217.78/cgi-bin/test4.cgi
the above link is what it should be outputing only with 4 times the data....

You will notice where the data starts to repeat at the 2nd Brian Gleason MWGL line.
>Fix:
I have no suggestions for a fix unless apache has a buffer control that I do not know about....

>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-feedback
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:43:50 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

Did you finish reading all the input before you started
sending output?  There is a known pipe deadlock condition,
that if we are still sending the cgi some of the input
from the request, the output can stall both pipes.
