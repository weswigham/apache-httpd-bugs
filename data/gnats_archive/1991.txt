>Unformatted:
I tried this version of the lib and the problem seems to have resolved itself. 
I've been up now without problems for more than 24hrs. 

Thanks.

It seems that the problem of dying httpds on RedHat 5.0 is solved by:

  Upgrade to glibc-{devel-}2.0.7-4
  Recompile apache (rpm --rebuild ...)

In other words: The bug is/was in glibc.

The server has now been up for 30 hours. Before the compile, the server
would die after max 6 hours.
