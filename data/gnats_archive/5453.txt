With the following configuration all combined access information that
was going to 'webdev-alog' is correctly going to 'ecom-dev.fore.com-alog'.

But System.err.println() messages continue to go to 'webdev-elog'

CustomLog /web/apache/logs/webdev-alog combined
ErrorLog /web/apache/logs/webdev-elog

<VirtualHost 169.144.2.162:443>
ServerName ecom-dev.fore.com
DocumentRoot /web/htdocs/ecom-dev
ErrorLog /web/apache/logs/ecom-dev.fore.com-elog
CustomLog /web/apache/logs/ecom-dev.fore.com-alog combined
SSLCertificateFile    /web/raven/module/pki/certs/ecom-dev.fore.com.cert
SSLCertificateKeyFile /web/raven/module/pki/keys/ecom-dev.fore.com.key
SSLEngine on

</IfDefine>
