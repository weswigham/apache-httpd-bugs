>Description:
Currently, once a user is authorized access, there is no way for other
modules nor CGI's to know why the user is authorized. They get AuthType
and remote_user information, but knowing the reason for the authorization
is also useful.

For example, if a directory was protected with:

require group foo bar

and a user was granted access because they were a member of group bar, then
conn_rec.auth_why would be set to "group bar". This information could
be made available to CGI's by setting "AUTH_WHY" in util_script.c

If this sounds resonable, let me know. I'm working on the required changes
for 1.2.x. I can make similar changes to 1.3 and submit patches

Just what would AUTH_WHY contain though?  The reasons for access

 I'm not sure I like the idea either.  It starts going a bit crazy when you
 look at what modules can actually do for auth...
 
 What could be useful is a group field to complement the user field.
 Users and groups are a reasonably generic concept in many auth modules, so
 setting the group they were found in could be useful and is something that
 people do ask for a lot.

 I agree, reasons for access being permitted are arbitrary, but all
 auth modules (at least with all modules I have looked at) act on a
 'require ...'. It is my suggestion then that it is up to the module to
 decide what AUTH_WHY is set to. For the mod_auth files that handle
 'require user ...', 'require group ...', and 'require valid-user', the
 suggested behavior is that they set AUTH_WHY to 'user ...', 'group
 ...', or 'valid-user', where in the case of 'user ...', '...' is the
 username that matched, and in the case of 'group ...', '...' is the
 group the user is a member of that matched.
 
 For auth_modules that grant access based on other criteria (for
 example, we are using a mod_auth_sys that we modified to work with NIS
 and accecpt 'require netgroup ...'), it is entirely up to module
 author to determine what 'AUTH_WHY' should be set to. As long as their
 behavior is documented, users of 'AUTH_WHY' shouldn't have any trouble
 knowing what to do.
 
 I would argue that is it even valid for an auth_ module not to set
 AUTH_WHY at all, and that a user of AUTH_WHY should treat this
 condition as 'the reason for access is unknown', and act accordingly.
