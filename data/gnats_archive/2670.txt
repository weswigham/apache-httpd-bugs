I tried twice.  The firs I get the binary version apache 1.3.  The second I get 
the source and I compiled OK.
>Description:
I have used apache 1.2 and I haven't had problems.  But, when I compiled apache 
1.3, the users can't access their www pages in theirs directories ~user/public

I configured the files httpd, smc and access correctly.  This situacion is rare,
we never had that problem with apache 1.1 and 1.2  In the file 
The permission is OK.  
In srm.conf --> UserDir public

FollowSymLinks and to get indexes you have to add Indexes.

 No you don't.
 
 As I said, you have:
 
 <Directory />
 Options None
 AllowOverride None
 </Directory>
 
 That is the only Directory section applying in this case.  It says
 do not allow symlinks to be followed and do not allow directory 
 indexes.  Please see the docs for the Options directive.
