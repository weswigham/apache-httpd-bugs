The only work arround to this involves giving users too much permissions.

To allow IndexIgnore directives in users .htaccess files I have to use
AllowOverride Options
or
AllowOverride All

Unlike the documentation:
AllowOverride Indexes
does not help.

The trouble is if I AllowOverride Options
users can give themselves CGI permissions!
>How-To-Repeat:
In access.conf
<Directory /home/*/www*>
Options Includes FollowSymLinks Indexes -ExecCGI
AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Indexes

order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>
and serve a user page with IndexIgnore in the .htaccess and you get "internal server error"
Add "Options" to AllowOveride (restart apache) and suddenly, no server error.
>Fix:
No.  I looked in the source and I can't workout why options has this effect, but it plainly does!

 What exactly is in the .htaccess file and what exactly is the error log
 saying?
