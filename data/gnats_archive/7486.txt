>Description:

 This was a really nasty problem to debug, due to the fact that I'd compiled
everything in statically, and then did;

bean [0]  ~john/work/apache_1.3.19/src/httpd -l
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_setenvif.c
  mod_php4.c

 and copied the output into httpd.conf, and prefixed each like with AddModule to
enabled everything. The result ? The server looped, using 100% of CPU, somewhere in the config.

 A protracted debugging session revealed that in http_config.c:1610 ap_init_modules()
was looping, with m->name always "http_core.c". I looked at the config file, took
out "AddModule http_core.c" and all was well.

 
>How-To-Repeat:
Just add "AddModule http_core.c" to the config file, and watch it loop!	
>Fix:
I know this was caused by my stupidity, but the server should do sanity checking
on the config file a little better...
