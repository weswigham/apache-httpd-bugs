 	Apoligies, if I wasn't clear.  What I am experincing is that I
 will recive the actual text of my cgi's in my browser window, and they
 will be listed as text/plain in the info on Netscape.  The problem is that
 there is no attempted excution of the scripts, they are just passed
 through as text.

 Is this the directory your scripts are under?  What is your DocumentRoot?

 Are you sure there are no htaccess files in the directory that may change
 the Options settings?
 
 Are you sure your DocumentRoot refers to that _exact_ directory, and not
 something that is a symlink to it?

 	There are no .htaccess files
