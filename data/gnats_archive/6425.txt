NT 4.0, SP 6.0a, MSVC++ 6.0, Xerces 1.2.0a
>Description:
The file xerces\util\XMLString.cpp has compile errors when built when XML_DEBUG is defined.  

When XML_DEBUG is defined, XMLString::cut code uses a variable called toCut, but it should be toCutFrom.
>How-To-Repeat:
define the constant XML_DEBUG and compile xerces\util\XMLString.cpp 
>Fix:
"toCut" should be changed to "toCutFrom"
