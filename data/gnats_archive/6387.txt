>Description:
After starting apache it works good and fast, but some minutes later (ca. 5 to 10 minutes
it slows down more and more, some graphics are no more loaded. Is this a known bug ? Is there any solution ?
We are starting in the moment the apache every 5 min with cron, so it works a little bit faster.
Maybe its important that we use about 10 aliasips.
