os-windows
>Description:
All environment variables used for cgi-bin (e.g. PATH_INFO, REMOTE_ADR,
QUERY_STRING) are buggy. They are only 4 bytes big, seems to be a pointer
instead of the environment variable and its content.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a cgi-bin batch file:

#!c:\command.com
set
set hello=abcd
set
dir

and call it ! You can see, "set" is working correct, because hello is inserted.
But all other variables are buggy...
