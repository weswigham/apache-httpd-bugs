Can you tell me the various reasons I might get the error message listed below?



HTTP Error 404

404 Not Found

The Web server cannot find the file or script you asked for. Please check the URL to ensure that the path is correct.

Please contact the server's administrator if this problem persists.


I need to know because I am working with a product integrated with Apache and certain word documents are not launcing properly.
but we are having no problems with many others. These documents have embedded images within them.

Thanks and regards

State-Changed-Why:
First off, there is no Apache 2.0.

Second, the error message seems pretty clear.  The
document you requested isn't found.

Not only that, but that error message is not an Apache
error message unless you customized it.

I'm afraid we really can't
