>Environment:
Linux 2.0.31 + GCC 2.7.2.3 + Apache-1.2.5 (SSL)
>Description:
When one generates a GET /cgi-bin/script?args=this (e.g., via a CGI script) and
I've configured a pass-through Proxy "ProxyPass / http://some.other.server/",
then Apache 1.2.5 fetches /cgi-bin/script from the remote server, leaving off
r->args.
>How-To-Repeat:
Very simple to repeat; just use the following template:

config file: ProxyPass / http://some.other.server/
from browser: GET /cgi-bin/script?args=this
>Fix:
It looks as if the URL is being broken down into r->url and r->args, but
for ProxyPass these two elements are never reassembled.  So when proxy_handler
(mod_proxy.c) calls proxy_http_handler() (http_protocol.c), it passes on a url
argument that lacks r->args.

As far as I can see, ProxyPass circumvents proxy_fixup().
