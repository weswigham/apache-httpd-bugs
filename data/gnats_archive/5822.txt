Windows 98, using the Win32 Build of Apache
>Description:
My specific problem deals with PHP.
I am using Apache build 1.3.12 on Windows 98.  I have installed PHP3 and followed the instructions provided by them to properly configure it in the httpd.conf file.  I downloaded the build of it, not the source, so it was already compiled when I got it.  It works like a charm when a php file is located in a real directory -
For example, my documentroot is c:\program files\apache group\apache\htdocs.
The file located in c:\program files\apache group\apache\htdocs\subfolder\index.phtml will work properly.
But, when I try to access a file in an aliased directory or a user directory, I get an error output from php.exe.  Here is an example:
"Fatal error: Unable to open c:\program files\apache group\apache\htdocs/~bud/index.phtml in - on line 0
No input file specified. "
Here's the thing with that!  There is no such file as c:\program files\apache group\apache\htdocs/~bud/index.phtml!  The real file on my system is c:\program files\apache group\apache\users\bud\index.phtml!  .phtml files are assigned to an Action, to run php.exe and process the file.  That's how the people who wrote the configuration for php said to do it and for the most part it works.  It seems that, at least on the Win32 port of Apache, the Action directive calls the program and sends the file name as the documentroot with the URI appended onto it.  That causes problems, seeing as php.exe receives a file name to process that doesn't exist.  Someone posted something earlier about this issue, about the exact problem I am having, but was told it was not an issue dealing with the server.  I am pretty sure it does deal with the server.  Any suggestion?  And do you plan to fix this in any upcoming releases?
>How-To-Repeat:
(Under Win32)
Alias a directory on your system, i.e. - alias c:\testfolder\ to /testfolder/ on your server.  Be sure Apache is properly configured to run php scripts, and that there is an Action directive to run them.  Place a file in c:\testfolder\ with a .phtml (or whatever extension you might use, .php3 is another common extension for it), and try to access it over the server.  You will get the same error I got.
>Fix:
I have none except for someone in the Apache Group to look into the issue and program a fix for it :)
