>Description:
The compilation doesn't work. I have out-commented some modules in the Configuration file, but none added. ./Configure runs through but the subsequent make yields parsing errors. Apache 1.2 was installed with the Linux package and runs. Here is a screenshot of make:
 
myserver:/usr/local/apache_1.3.2/src # make
===> regex
sh ./mkh  -i _REGEX_H_ regex2.h regcomp.c regerror.c regexec.c regfree.c > ../include/hsregex.h
sh ./mkh  -p regcomp.c >regcomp.ih

What is wrong ? Thank you for help.

type make after ./Configure

State-Changed-Why:
First, as always, please try 1.3.3 (ie. the latest version)
before submitting a bug report.

What are the contents of the first 20 lines or so of
/usr/include/netinet/in.h ?  This looks like a problem with
your system header files...
