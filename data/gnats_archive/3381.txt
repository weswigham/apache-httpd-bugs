>Description:
After configuring with

	DFLAGS=_LONG_LONG; ./configure     # see PR#3379

almost all files that was compiled got this warnings:

In file included from ../include/ap_config.h:919,
                 from logresolve.c:42:
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:152: warning: `struct ether_addr' declared inside parameter list
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:152: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration,
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:152: warning: which is probably not what you want.
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:153: warning: `struct ether_addr' declared inside parameter list
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:154: warning: `struct ether_addr' declared inside parameter list
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:159: warning: `struct sockaddr_dl' declared inside parameter list
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:160: warning: `struct sockaddr_dl' declared inside parameter list
/usr/include/arpa/inet.h:161: warning: `struct sockaddr_dl' declared inside parameter list

The web-server seems to run well even with this warnings.
When I compiled with C for AIX v4.4 (the IBM compiler), I didn't get any
compilation problem but I couldn't run it well (PR#2534)

State-Changed-Why:

The warnings are for code within the system header files.
There is nothing we can do to fix the AIX header files.

 I just asked to change the configuration scripts this way:
 
 If (OS=AIX-4.3.1 && CC=gcc-2.8.1)
      CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -D_LONG_LONG"
 
 Thank you,
 Avi
