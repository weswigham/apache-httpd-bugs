>Description:
I have links which are getting trashed by Apache.  The problem looks data-
dependent, in that some links get trashed, while others do not.  For what it's
worth, there are no directories named "sponsor" or "sponsors" in the top-level
directory of the test tree.  There is one named "details/sponsors" and ones
named "services" and "details/listings".

I have tried this file in two environments.  Both servers (production and
test) exhibit the problem.  Curiously, I do NOT see the problem when I
access the file on my production server via telnet and "GET /foo.shtml".

Here are some URLs for you to try, FWIW:

  http://cfcl.com/foo.shtml                 <- production server
  http://openresource.com:8873/foo.shtml    < test server
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is a test file (foo.shtml):
=====
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>test</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
      Help <A HREF="/sponsors/x.shtml">sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/sponsor/x.shtml" >sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/sponso/x.shtml"  >sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/services/x.shtml">sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/listings/x.shtml">sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/xxxxxxxx/x.shtml">sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
  </BODY>
</HTML>
=====
Here is the output, as received by Netscape 4:
=====
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>test</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
      Help <!--REF="/sponsors/x.shtm-->sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <!--REF="/sponsor/x.shtml-->sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/sponso/x.shtml"  >sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/services/x.shtml">sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/listings/x.shtml">sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
      Help <A HREF="/xxxxxxxx/x.shtml">sponsor</A> foo!<BR>
  </BODY>
</HTML>
=====

State-Changed-Why:
I see nothing to indicate that Apache is doing anything
with those links.  They may or may not be invalid HTML
(ie. due to the extraneous spaces between " and >), but
it certainly looks like an issue with your browser.  Why
do you think Apache is doing anything?  If you haven't
explicitly setup anything specail to vary responses based
on the browser, and the raw output doesn't have that, and
my client (Navigator 4.07 on FreeBSD) has no problem
with them, then it seems like it is probably your client...

 Blush.  It was my client.  More to the point, it was a Netscape
 add-on called Web Free which was "filtering" the string "sponsor".
 
 Sigh...
 
 Thanks for the help, though!
