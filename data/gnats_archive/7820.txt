 Production Mini-plants in mobile containers
 
 By Steven P. Leibacher, The Financial News, Editor
 
 Science Network has developed an revolutionary production method that is self-contained, immediate, portable, competitive, accessible because it is so cost-
 effective, and transportable by any means whatsoever: by land, sea, railroad or air. Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology=20and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile containe rs (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the=20production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring, piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant=20 is ready for production.
 
 More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework,=20Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polyprop ylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups,=20Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material,=20Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps,  etc.=20
 From a technological standpoint, it is an incontrovertible fact that this system is unique in the global area, aimed at solving very serious problems, starting with that=20which is most basic: the survival of millions of human beings.
 
 From the social, or rather, human standpoint, it is a technological development targeted from its conceptual beginnings to solve a worldwide immoral disgrace that=20=22statistically=22 takes on the form of 45,000 dead children a day as a result of hunger , poverty and non-fatal diseases.
 
 It is a tragedy that affects 200 countries and more than 4.5 billion human beings...
