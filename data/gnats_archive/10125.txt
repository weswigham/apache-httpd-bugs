Win2000 OEM ENU (English US) SP2
>Description:
I tried to biuld a ScriptAlias for a directory which contained an accented "E" ("É") in the middle. The ScriptAlias declaration itself was accepted but the corresponding <Directory> declaration caused Apache service not to start anymore (ApacheMonitor has died when I tried to use it to restart the service after the configuration change.) There was no entry in the error log. When the character in question was replaced with its accentless counterpart the things run smoothly.

I remembered it worked earlier with 1.3.23 on the same PC. I could try it with 1.3.22 on WinNT 4 OEM ENU SP6.0a and it worked, too. So gimme back my accented letters, please! :-)

 Hi Bill,
 
 I made some tests and really, if I save httpd.conf from Notepad in UTF-8 
 format and then delete the first 3 bytes (the UTF-8 header) with another 
 editor, then Apache service starts and uses the directories containing 
 accented characters normally. So I can live with it for now and wait for 
 the next version.
 
 Thanks a lot for your efforts!
 
 Best regards:

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the detailed experiments ... pending for the patch
resolution to .34.
Synopsis-Changed-From: <Directory> declarations do not accept accented characters. It works in 1.3.23.
Synopsis-Changed-To: Need to strip first three bytes of microsoftish utf-8 misencoding for .conf/.htaccess

State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Thu Apr  4 20:24:18 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

This will be fixed in 2.0.34.

The new patch simply eats those first three bytes of EF BB BF
whenever a config file is opened [that will -include- any
.htaccess or Include foo.conf directives.]

So we are now at 80% on utf-8 i18n.  Too bad it's always the
last 20% that eat up 80% of the effort :)

Thanks for your reports and thorough experiments!
