Windows 98, 64 mb ram, pentuim II 400mhz
>Description:
This is what my httpd is:

# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
# documents in the realname directory are treated as applications and
# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the client.
# The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias directives as to
# Alias.
#
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin "c:/apache/cgi-bin"

#
# "c:/apache/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
#
<Directory "c:/apache/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
</Directory>
<Directory C:/apache/cgi-bin>
Options ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
</Directory>
#
# Redirect allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist in
# your server's namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you to tell the
# clients where to look for the relocated document.
# Format: Redirect old-URI new-URL
#


AND HERE IS THE OTHER PART



# AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers",
# actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
# or added with the Action command (see below)
#
# If you want to use server side includes, or CGI outside
# ScriptAliased directories, uncomment the following lines.
#
# To use CGI scripts:
#
AddHandler cgi-script cgi
AddHandler cgi-script pl
AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .script
#
# To use server-parsed HTML files
#
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

#
# Uncomment the following line to enable Apache's send-asis HTTP file
# feature
#
AddHandler send-as-is asis

#
# If you wish to use server-parsed imagemap files, use
#
AddHandler imap-file map

#
# To enable type maps, you might want to use
#
AddHandler type-map var

#
# Action lets you define media types that will execute a script whenever
# a matching file is called. This eliminates the need for repeated URL
# pathnames for oft-used CGI file processors.
Action media/type /cgi-script/cgi-bin/
Action handler-name /cgi-script/cgi-bin/

State-Changed-From-To: open-feedback
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Nov 21 16:18:03 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
You need to try using a current version of Apache and include
an exact copy of what script you are trying.  Saying you
"tried all different sha-bangs" means absolutely nothing.

Also, be sure you try the smallest possible script to minimize
the areas that could have problems.
State-Changed-From-To: feedback-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Nov 21 21:29:11 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
You need to have perl installed on your system to use perl
CGIs.  If you don't know how to do that or where it is
installed, then the bugs database really isn't the place to
come for support.  Please see Usenet, as is suggested before
you submit a report.
