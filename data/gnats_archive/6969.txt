>Description:
I have been trying to trace a problem with apache whereby executing a system
command in a perl script will sometimes cause the server to hang, and then
reset the connection to the client partway through the output.  The script in
question runs fine under the Xitami web server, but fails under Apache.

This problem seems to be related to the one described here:
http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/5671
except that maybe the person writing the error report wasn't aware that the
problem could be encountered WITHOUT a large post to stdin.

This problem is most apparent when the script makes the browser do an 
autorefresh.
>How-To-Repeat:
Here is a trivial piece of code that recreates the problem.  I am using 
ActivePerl 5.005_03 and Apache 1.3.14 under WinNT and Win 2000, browsing with Internet Explorer 5.00.2919.  Note that swapping the order of the two loops makes the output come through uninterrupted.


#! C:\perl\bin\perl

use CGI;			# CGI (forms, html and the like) module
$query = new CGI;

$|=1;				# autoflush the buffer.

$program_name = $query->script_name();

print CGI->header;	# Prints the content-type to the browser so IE doesn't get confused.

print << "EndOfText";
<head>
<Title>
Test script
</title>
   <META HTTP-EQUIV=REFRESH CONTENT=\"1;URL=$program_name\">
</head>
<body>
<H2>
Test script to mess with apache under NT.

You should be able to see the words 'All is well' below.  Time is now:

EndOfText
$now_string = localtime(time);
print $now_string;

############# Swap the two loops below to make apache behave properly ###########

##### Loop 1: #####
$numLines = 0;
while($numLines < 100) {
   print "<!-- This is some text that should be ignored by your browser. -->\n";
   $numLines ++;
}

##### Loop 2: #####
$numLines = 0;
while($numLines < 10) {
   $output = `echo Simulating some system commands....`;
   $numLines ++;
}



print "<br>\n";
print "All is well.";

exit;


>Fix:
I fixed the problem by doing all the system commands before writing the large amounts of data to the browser, but this seems to be a bit of a hack.  
Perhaps the buffer sizes should be increased in the next Win32 release of apache?
