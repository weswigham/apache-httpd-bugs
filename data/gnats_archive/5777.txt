>Environment:
RH Linux 6.1, Kernel 2.2.14, GCC 2.9.5
>Description:
There is no way to lock down the read access to files located in a Virtual Host
Document tree, apart from the userid apache is running as. Currently, the only
means of having a Virtual Host run as a different user is through the User
command in the <VirtualHost> group. However, this does not seem to work, as the
Suexec program only switches userid when executing CGI's or SSI's.

For example, I would like Apache to be able to do the following:
Run document root website as user 'www'.
Run several different virtual hosts as user 'www'.
Run a secure webserver (different vhost & DocumentRoot) as user 'secureweb'.

DocumentRoot of the secure webserver is set to /usr/local/secureweb.
I would like to be able to chown this directory to the uid 'secureweb' and
set the chmod to 700 and still be read by Apache because the <VirtualHost>
directive has the command 'User secureweb' in it.

Right now, I get access denied messages because user 'www' has no access to
the tree /usr/local/secureweb.

Thanks for reading this report.
