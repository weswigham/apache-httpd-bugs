State-Changed-Why:

You should consider using the <!--#flastmod element
if you are interested in the last modification time
on a particular file.  I understand that doesn't
exactly solve your problem, but In order to really
do what you want, Apache would need to stat a bunch
of files before it started to serve your SSI, which
could wind up slowing things down.
Thanks for using Apache.
