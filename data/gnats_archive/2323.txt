Linux 2.0.32 #1 Wed Nov 19 00:46:45 EST 1997 i486 unknown
Redhat 5.0
apache-1.3b
Use apache with inetd.
>Description:
Some modules like so_mod bring logs before logfile is initialize.
so the logs output diretly to stderr. But when I use inetd to start httpd, them well be send to WWW brower.
>How-To-Repeat:
configure with --enable-module=most --module-shared=max 

In httpd.conf set ServerType inetd.
charge inetd.conf

>Fix:
Check ServerType in function ap_log_error in http_log.c,
if ServerType is inetd, and logfile handle is null,
ignore the logs.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm sure you're using Apache 1.3b6. I've fixed this
in 1.3b7.  Please use this version and try again.
There should be no more mod_so debug messages
show up on stderr. Please reply if 1.3b7 fixed the
problem for you, too.
