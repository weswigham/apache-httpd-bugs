Windows NT 4.0 SP 3, Binary Distribution
>Description:
Apache does not properly install as a service when using a particular
configuration. For example, the command

  apache -i -f "conf\0\httpd.conf".

installs Apache as a service, but the service starts with the default
configuration "conf\http.conf" rather than the configuration
"conf\0\httpd.conf" specified during installation.
