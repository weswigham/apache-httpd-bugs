Doesn't matter
>Description:
The README that comes with 1.3b3 states:

 Finally, make a call to httpd, with a -f to the full path to the
 httpd.conf file.  I.e., the common case:

  /usr/local/etc/apache/src/httpd -f /usr/local/etc/apache/conf/httpd.conf

The path should be changed to reflect the new default (/usr/local/apache).
