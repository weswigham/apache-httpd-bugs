WIN XP pro, 1000 Mhz Athlon T-Bird, 256 Mb ram
>Description:
[Fri Jan 25 19:41:08 2002] [error] (32557)Socket is not connected: setsockopt(SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT) failed.

Clean fresh install of Apache 2.0.28 (Default settings) on WIN XP pro creates this error in an intervall of about between 30 seconds and 3 minutes and fills the error log real quickly.

I tried changing settings of my firewall, and other things. No success.
Had to uninstall it again.

I had good success running Ap 2.0.28 on the same machine with WIN 2000 as the OS.

>How-To-Repeat:
I uninstalled, cleaned registry, reinstalled. Same problem!
Might be a WIN Xp problem.

no

State-Changed-When: Mon Mar 25 23:02:32 PST 2002
State-Changed-Why:

First, there is a bug in Windows XP that involves socket data
corruption that could interact here, see 'XP Read Me First';

  http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/

Also we have a number of bugs solved in the forthcoming
2.0.34 release for Windows which should eliminate this
problem altogether.
