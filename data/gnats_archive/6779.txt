uname -a:
   Linux delldev.cnavsystems.com 2.2.14-6.1.1smp #1 SMP Thu Apr 13 19:55:55 
   EDT 2000 i686 unknown
Linux-redhat 6.2, gcc 2.91.66 on a dual processor dell poweredge server
we are also running coldfusion 4.5 and JRun 3.0 as modules into apache.
>Description:
every once in a while we get runaway libhttpd.ep processes that will
eventually eat up all cpu time on the server.  This happened quite often with
apache 1.3.12 but disappeared for a while once upgrading to version 1.3.14.
In the past couple of days though it has resurfaced.  The problem also occurs
on a pair of laptops running the same software configuration.
>How-To-Repeat:
It happens sporadically, and we're still trying to repeat it or find out if it 
is a specific module, mod_jrun.so or mod_coldfusion.so or mod so in general.
Suggestions on how we could track it down would be helpful.
>Fix:
wish I did, right now we just do a restart and it clears them out.
