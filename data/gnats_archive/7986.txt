>Description:
A description with examples, sample code can be found at:

http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~davison/error/

I'm not sure of the severity of this bug, except probably for high-volume reverse proxy caching with uncacheable resources.
>How-To-Repeat:
Multiple connections need to request the same file (probably at very close to the same time).

>Fix:
Haven't yet looked into the code.  
My wild guess is that apache allows the serving of objects in memory before they have been checked for cacheability.
