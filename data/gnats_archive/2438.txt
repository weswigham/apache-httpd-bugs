 I have never heard of such a problem before.
 
 Are you sure it isn't just some thing used in the HTML on the page that
 happens to be served by an Apache server?
 
 What error, exactly, was given to the user when they try?
 
 Unless we can get some more details I'm afraid we will have to close the
 PR based on inability to replicate it combined with the fact that we have
 never had any previous reports of this...

 The html page was the test page setup by Red Hat Linux 5.0
 installation of Apache 1.2.4-4, so I don't think the problem is in the
 html. The WebTV user tried to email me the error but all I got was a
 link to the page. She said it said that WebTV could read the page but
 did not know what to do with it. Acting on the assumption that
 http://www.apache.org runs the Apache server, I had her access their
 home page and she had no problems. She did say that she has received
 that error before when trying to reach Apache servers. The suggests it
 might be a problem specific to 1.2.4-4 and not the latest version
 (which I assume the apache.org runs). As I said before, it sounds very
 much like the problem with AOL not liking headers reporting version
 1.2. Perhaps if someone from Apache could contact WebTV, the problem
 could be easily fixed.

 Actually, this sounds more to me as though the document in question is
 being served with a Content-Type that WebTV doesn't know how to
 handle.  Can you have the WebTV person send you the URL (and then send
 it to us; don't forget to CC <apbugs@Apache.Org> and keep the subject
 the same as this message!).  That way we can at least verify the
 headers the site in question is emitting.
