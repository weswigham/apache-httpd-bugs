>Description:
Please don't be offended but I saw people more than once trying to run apache or apachectl binaries with the --version parameter and they had to look into the help screen to notice that they have to use -v.

I think this might be a nice addition to it. - and also mirror the information in apachectl.

If you strictly don't want this or you hate long parameters just close the bug and we'll be able to live with that but it might be a nice addition IMHO.
