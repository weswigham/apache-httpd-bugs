>Description:
The bug is located in ap_get_local_host function in util.c file. Below is the code which contains the bug:

        if ((!(p = gethostbyname(str))) 
            || (!(server_hostname = find_fqdn(a, p)))) {
            /* Recovery - return the default servername by IP: */
	    if (p->h_addr_list[0]) {
									ap_snprintf(str, sizeof(str), "%pA", p->h_addr_list[0]);
		server_hostname = ap_pstrdup(a, str);
	/* We will drop through to report the IP-named server */
	}
        }
 
Basically, if p is NULL, the p->h_addr_list[0] is going to be executed. Now you know how it crashes.
>How-To-Repeat:
