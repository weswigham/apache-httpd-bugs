Dupe PR.
>Unformatted:
In 1.3 there is a new feature which allows sortable directory listing if
a directory listsing is displayed with FancyIndexing.  However there is
no way to default how a list is sorted, like sort by LastModified with
latest date first. The default of this was never programed into the new
version.  Is it possible to add a directive like: ColumnSorting
LastDate, or the such?
