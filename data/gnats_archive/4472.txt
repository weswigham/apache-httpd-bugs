Linux-2.2.9
>Description:
I have two issues with content negotiation and MultiViews:
First when I have thew files `index.html' and `index.html.en' with
DefaultLanguage set to `de', the following happened: Netscape (4.51)'s
language preference had been set to "de-DE", and this did not cause
Apache to return the file for language `de'. IMHO matching `de' for
`de-DE' is better than matching for `en'.
Secondly, it seems that Multiviews does not work when the URL is
http://server.domain/, but when it is http://server.domain/index
>How-To-Repeat:
I think you can reproduce the problem easily.
>Fix:
The index file should use the MultiView algorithm as well, and
matching should prefer a `de' document for any `de-*' language
preference over other languages. Same would apply for the other direction.

State-Changed-Why:

You say you have the files "index.html" and "index.html.en"
and want "de-DE" to match the file for "de".  You don't
say so explicitly, but I presume you're getting the
"index.html.en" file, correct?  Do you want the "index.html"
file instead if there are no variants that exactly match
your language preference?  Or do you have an "index.html.de"
file you didn't mention?
