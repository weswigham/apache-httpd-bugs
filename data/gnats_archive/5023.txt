>Description:
mod_usertrack currently does not set the domain name for the cookie.  this causes the browser to only send the cookie up to the exact server name the cookie came from.  there's a couple of reasons this is not optimal.  for servers that answer to multiple server names, such as www.apache.org and apache.org, a seperate cookie would get set for each, depending on which url the user entered.  the user would appear as two seperate users.  another problem is instances where it is desirable to track users across distinct servers, such as bugs.apache.org and dev.apache.org.  the solution would be to set the domain of the cookie to .apache.org. with the directive CookieDomain.  the cookie would then get sent to all of the above mentioned servers, and there would only be one cookie per user.

alternatively, you can hard code into mod_usertrack.c.  yay.
