 Apache Foundation Software:
 
 my society (Mediatel limited liability company of Ferrara) has recorded
 several space hosting and dominions on the provider under listed:
 http://www.widestore.net
 
 The problem is that, even if they have the extensions of FrontPage 2000, the
 serveur Apache does not process the ASP and the connection with the database
 of Access 2000.
 Alternative proposed from the technicians is to manage the database with
 MySQL, but it must set up specific cgi Perl... or to manage all on-linens
 (too much complicated for we!)...
 Unfortunately, for inner automatic issues to our company (a CALL CENTER in
 increase... the matter uses exclusively produced to Microsoft) all becomes
 difficult and expensive in time and money:
 
 1) as I can make to transform, to connect, to manage the data from Access to
 MySQL (+ My-ODBC)..., exist simple procedures and automatic, guides with
 regard to, exist driver of in order exporting directly to the MySQL format
 or that they generate similar rows?
 2) you have other suggestions and instruments alternatives to propose?
 3) it is not just possible to manage the ASP or the PHP can find the data
 from Access rows? Of continuation directory all the characteristics to my
 disposition on the serveur, provider, extensions, etc...
 
 You I augur good job.
 Aspect with anxiety your answers... (rienzi.garberoglio@infinito.it or
