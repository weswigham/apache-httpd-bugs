>Environment:
SGI Irix 6.5 but should occur on all platforms
>Description:
Check out line 676 in http_vhost.c in the main directory. It performs a isalnum check on each character of the hostname string I guess to make sure it contains valid characters. The inalnum() function however does not recognize the underscore "_" as valid. However it is valid and should be allowed.
>How-To-Repeat:
My server is on a classified network...however if you configure a machine to have an underscore in the name (i.e. my_server.anywhere.com) you should see the problem.
>Fix:
I've tried a couple of things but I haven't found anything that works yet...I tried to add a line like if(*src == '_') continue; after the check for ":" but that causes an infinite loop. Maybe we need to add  && *src != '_' to line 676...I'll try that tomorrow.
