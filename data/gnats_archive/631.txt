>Description:
There are times, seemingly unrelated to the load on the machine, when any and
all output from perl scripts just doesn't work. If it's an entire page output
from a CGI, the result is a 500 error. If it's an SSI, it returns [an error
occurred while processing this directive].
Most of the time, all scripts run with no problem. Server load is generally
about 0.3, and the problem goes away immediately if I reload Apache.
Could this be a problem with the number of spare servers running? Min is 5,
Max is 15. Each of these glitches seems to last from 2 to 5 minutes.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try looking at http://www.lionking.org for the SSI's, and http://www.lionking.org/today.cgi
for the 500 error.

State-Changed-Why:
There could be a file descriptor leak somewhere, maybe something
caused by the bsdi c library.  If you can catch the server while it's
doing this, then try running lsof <ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof>
against some of the children and the parent.  They should all
have about the same number of open files +/- two or three.

Are there any errors in the error_log when this happens?
