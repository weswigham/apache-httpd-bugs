>Environment:
BSDI 4.0.1, shipped compiler
>Description:
I have the following :


RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/lcgi-bin/wwwjoin/admin/www800.cgi http://aserver.karupspc.com/lcgi
-bin/wwwjoin/admin/www800.cgi [R,L]
RewriteRule ^/lcgi-bin/wwwjoin/signup.cgi http://aserver.karupspc.com/lcgi-bin/w
wwjoin/signup.cgi [R,L]
RewriteRule ^/lcgi-bin/ttsgvalidate.cgi http://aserver.karupspc.com/lcgi-bin/tts
gvalidate.cgi [R,L] 

However, whenever I access http://bserver.karupspc.com/lcgi-bin/wwwjoin/signup.cgi
it'll redirect to http://aserver.karupspc.com/lcgi-bin/wwwjoin/signup.cgi but
not pass any of the form data.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create form, put rules in server b, access form on server b, when it redirects to
server a all data is lost.
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:

It looks as though all you're trying to do here is a
redirect; why don't you use the simple Redirect* directives
instead of the big gun of RewriteRule?

You don't say whether the data getting 'lost' is in the
form of a POST message-body or a GET query-string on the
URL.  Which is it?
