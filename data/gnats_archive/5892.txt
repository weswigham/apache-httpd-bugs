Hello all,
I'm trying to change the UID of file created with a script, but I get "chown: 
file: Not owner".
I have the file and the script:
/www/cgi-bin> ls -l
total 2
-rwxr-xr-x   1 www      www          175 Mar 16 09:49 cambio.cgi*
-rw-r--r--   1 www      www            0 Mar 16 09:36 prueba

cambio.cgi contains:
/www/cgi-bin> cat cambio.cgi
#!/bin/sh
chown gaspari:webmail prueba
echo Content-Type: text/plain
echo
....

HTTPD is running as www:www

The script runs fine, but i can't get chown work. Does anyone known what i'm doing wrong?

Thanks in advance!!

Cristian

 chown command with both user and group ownership
 changed works fine when the script is run with httpd
 running as root.
  
 If you are running httpd as non-root user ie.,as www
 user, you can assign access of one of your files to a
 group, but unless you are running httpd as root, you
 cannot assign one of your files to appear to have been
 either created by or owned by another user.
