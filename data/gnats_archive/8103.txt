>Description:
I got Apache from SCO site, in tar format. I had created a /tmp/install directory and I ran custom to install from directory.
After this, the apache cannot start. It's not finding "dlopen".

I had tried to run software checking (custom option) so I found problem but the software cannot fix it.

>Fix:
Sorry, I don't.
