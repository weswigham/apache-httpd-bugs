Apache 1.3.19 for windows - binary distribution
>Description:
I instaled the apache server software under c:\appl\Apache
Server works, but starting the CGI script c:\appl\Apache\cgi-bin\printenv.pl using
http://<server>/cgi-bin/printenv.pl gives the internal server error with entry
couldn't spawn child process: c:/appl/apache/cgi-bin/printenv.pl
I am using the default httpd.conf file
I have enabled OPTION +ExecCGI for the directory
I have enabled AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
I am using NTFS, file permissions are checked and OK
I have checked the bug-db and none of the articles helped
Perl is installed, script runs in command mode
Shouldn't the out-of-the-box script run?

Any help appreciated - the best solution, switch to linux, is not available. The 
linux httpd.conf file does not change the situation (linux on second partition)

Ciao, Mathias
