>Description:
I'ld like to see support for password auth files looking like the unix
password file.

Currently only username:password fields are supported. An additional extrafield
would be good, so you can write scripts to maintain your password database for
your webservers and see additional information (like username, phone-number etc).

Therefor the apache server needs to check for the password in a different way.

Patch is included ...

State-Changed-Why:
This has been requested many times and in the past we
have declined to make the change for security reasons;
most people wanted it to use /etc/passwd for authentication,
which is a bad idea.

We seem to have changed our minds, though, so I will see
about changing this for the next release...
