Win 95
>Description:


Actually, it is not a problem, but a question. Can I use Apache server
to serve only my local machine -- machine where Apache is running.
How do I enter something in DNS, so that my browser does not complain, that
there is no such a DNS entry?
If it is possible to run Apache without network, locally, then please, 
give me directions how to configure Apache.
I run it on Win'95 platform.

Thank you.

This is not the place to be asking for directions on
configuring your OSes networking.  Please check out the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup, where
many people can answer such basic configuration questions.
