>Description:
mod_user_dir uses the stat() call as it tries to determine which possible
user directory to use. It assumes that a failed stat means the directory being
tried is invalid and should be skipped. However, if the directory in question
is on a network file system, the stat could return ETIIMEDOUT if the file system
is unavailable. In that case, I think an error should be returned rather than
trying the next possible user directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
n/a
>Fix:
If stat() fails, I propose testing the error and returning HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE
if it is ETIMEDOUT, as follows:

      if (filename) {
        if (!*userdirs || stat(filename, &statbuf) != -1) {
          r->filename = ap_pstrcat(r->pool, filename, dname, NULL);
            /* when statbuf contains info on r->filename we can save a syscall
             * by copying it to r->finfo
             */
          if (*userdirs && dname[0] == 0)
            r->finfo = statbuf;
          return OK;
        }
        if (errno == ETIMEDOUT) return HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE;
      }
