>Environment:
Linux amethyst 2.0.29 #1 Wed Jun 11 17:14:14 BST 1997 i586

GCC version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Apache does not find or use the suexec program, even when the SUEXEC_BIN variable
and file permissions (4711) and ownership (root) are correct.

I have tested this by using identicle httpd.h and conf/* files for both releases
1.2b11 and 1.2.0. 1.2b11 works as expected, reporting

Configuring Apache for use with suexec wrapper

whereas 1.2.0 does not.

A further test running a cgi script to print the output of 'id' proved that 1.2.0
was failing to use suexec
>How-To-Repeat:
The script I used was as follows:

#!/bin/bash
# id.cgi
echo -e 'Content-type: text/plain\n\n'
echo `id`

Running this script from within a users public_html directory should give the
users id, not the id of the user running the web server.

Comment-Added:
There are no functional or code differences between 1.2b11
and 1.2.0 - if you are seeing a difference it is probably
due to a compilation error.  A very common mistake is to
forget to #define SUEXEC_BIN, for example setting

EXTRA_CFLAGS= -DSUEXEC_BIN="\"/path/to/executable/suexec\""

in the Configuration file, running ./Configure, then make.
