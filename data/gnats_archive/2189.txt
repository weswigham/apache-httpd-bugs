NT/4.0 i386 (Server & Workstation, SP3); MSVC++/5.0
>Description:
Content from files specified in HeaderName and ReadmeName directives in 
.htaccess file not displayed, and error log contains:
[Tue May 05 21:49:10 1998] [crit] (22)Invalid argument: e:/apache/htdocs/e:/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable

ap_sub_req_lookup_file decides if rnew->filename is already 
fully-qualified by checking to see if the first character is a '/', 
which of course fails on Win32 (where a full path begins with a drive 
letter, e.g. 'C:').
>How-To-Repeat:
srm.conf: 
  Options All
  AllowOverride All

.htaccess:
  HeaderName .foo
  ReadmeName .bar

Directory contains .foo.html & .bar.html

Directory listing does not display contents of either .foo.html or .bar.html
>Fix:
Replace test for '/' with call to ap_os_is_path_absolute:

--- http_request.c	Tue May 05 22:53:09 1998

                            ap_pstrdup(rnew->pool, new_file) :

          rnew->per_dir_config = r->server->lookup_defaults;
