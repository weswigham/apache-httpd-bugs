Windows NT 4.0 with service pack 6a
Visual C++ 5.0 compiler
>Description:
The function handle_include in mod_include.c has a call to strcmp
(the third strcmp call in that function) that can sometimes have a null
argument.  q->filename is the arguement that can sometimes be null.
>How-To-Repeat:
There seem to be two ways where you can get q->filename to be null.
1) have a URL that starts with a slash followed by two dots e.g. /..
2) Send many post requests to the server at one time.
>Fix:
In mod_include.c, put in an extra check for the third strcmp in the
 handle_include function.
Check if q->filename is NULL before doing the strcmp.
