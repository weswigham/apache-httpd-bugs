>Description:
Linux 2.0.26 / sparc doesn't have RLIMIT_AS in /usr/include/asm/resource.h, so
compilation fails on src/main/util_script.c:

make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/apache-cvs/apache-1.3/src/main'
gcc -c  -I../os/unix -I../include    -DLINUX=2 -DSERVER_SUBVERSION=\"PHP/3.0-dev
\" -DUSE_HSREGEX   util_script.c
util_script.c: In function `call_exec':
util_script.c:625: `RLIMIT_AS' undeclared (first use this function)
util_script.c:625: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
util_script.c:625: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [util_script.o] Error 1
>How-To-Repeat:
Build on SparcLinux 2.0.26
>Fix:
The following diff on src/include/conf.h seems to work...

God damn can there be more differences between linux distributions
and versions?

Try the next snapshot of 1.3b6-dev I already did something better
than what you suggested.
