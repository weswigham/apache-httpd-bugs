>Description:
I found that host names I didn't want exposed were contained in the httpd.conf
file after building 1.3.4. The configure script obviously grokked my hostname
and decided to be clever. I've had to rebuild 8 versions to remove the bad
hostname and replace it with root@example.org.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build the source and make install and look at httpd.conf
>Fix:
Remove the hostname guessing code from configure

State-Changed-Why:

In many situations the hostname is guessed correctly
and if not it is always possible to change it in the
configuration. There is no need to 'rebuild' Apache!?

 I didn't say it had to be rebuilt, my packages did however. I stated I didn't
 think it a correct choice to deliberately include the build machines hostname
 in a configuration file. It creates a situation where unecessary information
 is contained in the conf files. (Un-necessary in the sense it's doesn't require
 the compiling host's hostname to be put into a file simply to make a httpd.conf.
 We have flagged it as a bug which will be levied against any future apache
 releases before they are allowed to be distributed internally.
