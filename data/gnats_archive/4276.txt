>Description:
passing a URL to the rewriteprog wich contains %0A in fact 
passes 2 lines to the rewriteprog. Because of the recommeded 
structure of the rewriteprog (one line in, one line out)
the apache gets back two lines wich is very confusing for it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a {prg:/my/rewriteprog} and pass a url containing
%0A to it.
>Fix:
A workaround is to prepend a magic string to the url.
If the rewriteprg cannot find the magic string at the begin of a
inputline it should produce no output

 I had this happen to me as well, and came up with a different
 work-around that I thought I'd mention here.  Use the built-in
 RewriteMap functions int:escape and int:unescape immediately before and
 after any external prg: type Map.  That way, you avoid this and several
 other potential special-character related problems, such as sloppy Perl
 code interpreting backquotes in URLs as shell commands, which is bad
 (not that I've ever had it happen to me ;-] ).  So you re-escape the
 URL, thereby translating the carriage return back to %0A and the URL
 becomes one line again.  Not necessarily better for this one problem,
 but worth mentioning.
