OS:  WinNT4.0 SP3
Compiler:  MSVC 5.0
>Description:
I have a CGI program written in C which outputs a continuous stream of data
at fixed intervals.  After each printf() I call fflush(stdout).  
When the program is run from the shell prompt the output appears correctly
(i.e. not buffered).  
When the program is run via CGI on WinNT the output is buffered (buffer size 
appears to vary from approx. 512 to 2048 bytes).  When the CGI program is compiled and run on Solaris 2.6 the output is not buffered.  
The client application in both cases is a Java application using an HttpURLConnection.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a known problem on Win32 due to the lack of certain
basic functionality in the Win32 API being used.  It is
already being tracked under an earlier PR.
