>Environment:
RedHat linux 6.2, kernel 2.2.12-20, default RH build - SSL version
>Description:
Apache appears to be finding the Virtual Hosts correctly with "httpd -S" however all VH's use the main DocumentRoot entry in httpd.conf.  If I remove the main DocumentRoot it uses what appears to be a default internal setting of "/usr/htdocs" (determined by checking the error log when I then got a 404).  There are no errors in in the logfile with the following config.

httpd.conf:

ServerType standalone
Port 80
ScoreBoardFile /var/run/httpd.scoreboard
ServerRoot /etc/httpd
HostnameLookups off
ServerAdmin root@localhost
DocumentRoot /home/httpd/defdocroot
ErrorLog /home/httpd/error.log
User nobody
Group nobody
Options ExecCgi Includes MultiViews FollowSymlinks
LogLevel warn
UseCanonicalName on
NameVirtualHost 216.161.89.26

<VirtualHost 216.161.89.26>
	DocumentRoot /home/httpd/0xcafe
	ServerName www.0xcafe.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 216.161.89.26>
	DocumentRoot /home/httpd/triaxis
	ServerName www.triaxissoftware.com
</VirtualHost>
>How-To-Repeat:
All three document roots contain an index.html file which displays the directory path.  The config file listed is the one in use, both domains are served from /home/httpd/defdocroot as indicated by the pathname displayed by the html page.
