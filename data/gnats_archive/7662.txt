>Description:
when multiviews is used (i.e. zoom.gif.en) the filename must be in all lowercase.
Yes, I know that nt is not case sensitive, but it IS in this case!  The
URL is of mixed case, and so is the filesystem, but apache is requiring that
the filesystem be lowercase.  See the example
>How-To-Repeat:
create tree:

chdir ...\htdocs
mkdir lang
chdir lang
echo "English" > Test.html.en

point browser at "http://server/lang/Test.html" and it 404's

del Test.html.en
echo "english" > test.html.en

reload page, and it now works.

Looking through mod_negotiation, I can't figure out where it actually tests 
for the file existance (when looking at the various extentions).
>Fix:
read_types_multi() gets a listing of the files using readdir().  This 
appears to be the source of the lower case filenames that are being strcmp()'ed.

I can't think of any clean way other than to #ifdef win32...stricmp()...
which isn't terribly clean.

Or find a readdir() that preserves case?

oh wait, readdir() is in os/win32/readdir.c Hm...

I'm downloading cygwin so I can debug this further, but I'll submit this now so that 
if someone more knowledgeable knows an answer, I don' tneed to expend further energy

 This is definitely a bug in mod_negotiation.
 
 readdir() should return mixed case, but does not.  since these wrappers
 just call _findfirst and _findnext which are microsoft api's, there
 should be a workaround in mod_negotiation to use stricmp instead of strcmp
 on line 929:
 
 -        if (strncmp (dir_entry->d_name, filp, prefix_len)) {
 +        if (strnicmp(dir_entry->d_name, filp, prefix_len)) {
 
 (space after 'strncmp' added for clarity)
 
 cygwin works, but not everyone has it installed, unfortunately.  If I
 use ms vc++ 5.0, that's the correct workaround.
