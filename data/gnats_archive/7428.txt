>Environment:
# uname -a
HP-UX hants B.11.00 A 9000/816 1915338291 two-user license
patches PHCO_22314 and PHSS_19956, possibly other libc and ld related patches are installed.  
>Description:
httpd will not start after default binary install.  cut&paste:
  # opt/apache/apache/bin/apachectl start
  /usr/lib/dld.sl: Call to mmap() failed - TEXT /opt/apache/apache/libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so
  /usr/lib/dld.sl: Permission denied
  Syntax error on line 207 of /opt/apache/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
  Cannot load /opt/apache/apache/libexec/mod_vhost_alias.so into server: Permission denied
  opt/apache/apache/bin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started
  # 

See http://www.devresource.hp.com/CXX/Forums/cxx-dev/cxx-dev.0008/0105.html for 
another instance of this problem.  
>How-To-Repeat:
downloaded http://httpd.apache.org/dist/binaries/hpux/apache_1.3.19-9000-715-hp-hpux11.00.tar.gz .
untarred and ran "./install-bindist.sh /opt/apache/apache" .  
got above results.  
>Fix:
libexec/*.so must be executable.  chmod +x libexec/*.so worked for me.  
the package should probably be shipped this way, or else the need to chmod should
be added to the documentation.

>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Thu Oct 18 08:35:14 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
The binary distribution for apache 1.3.22 on HP-UX has been
specially built so that the DSOs will be installed with the
executable bit on.

The mechanism for packaging a binary distribution has been 
modified in apache 1.3.23-dev so that this problem won't
occur in the future.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention, and thanks for
using Apache!
