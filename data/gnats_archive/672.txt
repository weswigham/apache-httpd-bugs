(See also PR#665)
For any file with an extension such as `.ps.gz',
Apache returns

Content-Type: application/x-gzip
Content-Encoding: x-gzip

This is incorrect.  The content-type should be
application/postscript.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
PR#665 proposes a source patch.
Alternatively, we can work around it if we just change the 
(distribution) configuration files:
In file 'mime.types', we comment out the lines for 'application/x-gzip',
and also for 'application/x-compress'. They do not describe contents
but encondings. See also the 'AddEncoding' entries in file 'srm.conf

State-Changed-Why:
Yes, the solution you propose is the more correct one.  
The source patch suggested behaves incorrectly under
some conditions.  Note that the content-type for .gz files
was taken out of the distribution mime.types file a
long time in 1.2bsomething.
