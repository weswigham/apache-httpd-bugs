Doing a 'kill -16 PID' on my Ultrix machine does not work.
The error.log shows the messages:
"SIGUSR1 received.  Doing graceful restart" and "Server configured -- resuming normal operations",
but the config file isn't reread rsp. the server isn't restarted (as shown
by mod_status).

State-Changed-Why:
As documented in the htdocs/manual/stopping.html page a graceful
restart does not reset the scoreboard.  A better test would
be to look at the children pids before and after the restart.
Ultrix is one of those architectures with unreliable restarts
though ... because it requires a scoreboard file.  The docs talk
about that.

Thanks for the report.
