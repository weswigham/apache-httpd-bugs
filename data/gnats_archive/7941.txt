>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000. Apache 1.3.14 and Tomcat 3.2.1
Dual pentium III processors with 1 GB memory
>Description:
I have a production application running on Apache server with Tomcat as servlet engine. The apache server fails to respond after regular interval of once a day.
There is no response from Apache when it happens and killing apache process is the only way to get out of this mess.
All this time, if I try to run the app. through tomcat( port 8080),application is running fine.

Need to know a solution sooner as this is becoming a big issue w.r.t dependability of Apache on Win2000 m/c. The number of hits is not that large. Just 20-30 users connected at all time -  all day.

Have a windows 2000 m/c and apply medium-high load

 There have been a number of patches, some quite subtle, that could have an
 effect on these problems.  Please upgrade Apache to 1.3.20 (necessary to avert
 a denial-of-service attack) and Tomcat 3.2.2, the combination of which may
 impact your issue.  If that doesn't solve the problem, please try to provide
 a useful amount of detail on the type of traffic that fails v.s. anything that
 still functions (does loading mod_status allow you to watch for dead connections,
 etc.)
 
 And you may wish to think about using the MaxRequestsPerChild argument.  Although
 there would be up to a one minute hiccup, if you can time it about once a day that
 shouldn't be all too noticable, and is preferable to your current problem.
 
 The other obvious point, what modules are used/loaded on this server?
