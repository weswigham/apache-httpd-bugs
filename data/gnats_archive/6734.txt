>Description:
I'm trying to get JRUN3.0 taliking to Apache
1.3.14. I've followed the steps in the connection
wizard, which has updated my httpd.conf file as
it should. I.e:

LoadModule jrun_module "C:\JRun\connectors\apache\intel-win\mod_jrun136.dll"
 
However, when trying to start Apache, I get an
error along the lines of:
 
Cannot load:
d:/apache_web_server/D:\jrun_dev\connectors\apache
\intel-win\mod_jrun136.dll
into server.
 
As you can see, somehow information is being appended to the load module directive. There is nowhere at all within the httpd.conf file that d:/apache_web_server could be coming from, as far as I can figure out. I've been through the file tie and again, and all is a sit should be - so it must be coming from elsewhere within the system - presumably somewhere in Apache.

Why the first part of the line
(d:/apache_web_server/) is there, I do not know,
since it is not part of the path to the dll.
 
Any ideas?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Tried re-running the connection wizard in JRun with the same results. Haven't tried reinstalling Apache or JRun, since can't see that this would make any difference. Have isolated it to the line indicated by commenting out, and Apache then runs fine.

State-Changed-Why:
You used backslashes in the path name instead of slashes,
as indicated by the documentation (within the httpd.conf 
file and elsewhere.)
