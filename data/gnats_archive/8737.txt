>Organization:
>Environment:
Suse IMAP II (based on Suse 7.0)
AMD Athlon 900 / 256 MB
gcc 2.95.2
>Description:
OPTIM="-O2" ./configure --enable-so --enable--generic-hook-import --enable-generic-hook-export --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 --disable-debug --disable-maintainer-mode

make (works)
make install (fails)

By the way: even with --disable-debug the compiler is called with -g option!
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The problem is that the . is not included in the searchpath.
I did a export PATH=$PATH:. before making "make install" and all was just fine!
Thanks for your great software!
