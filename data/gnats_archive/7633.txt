uname -a: Linux Linux 2.4.3 #1 SMP Web Apr 25 08:27:51 BST 2001 i686 unknown
gcc -v: gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
>Description:
apachectl start or just calling httpd from the command line causes it to start, then exit normally with no error messages. setting the log detail to debug simply gives the message "[info] created shared memory segment  #xxxxx" and no other information, apart from if I forget to delete httpd.pid when it warns that there may have been a previous unclean shutdown.
>How-To-Repeat:
Seemingly from a similar post on usenet (with no given resolution!!!), it happens on linux 2.4.3 system with 1.3.19, though 1.3.17 gave me the same problem.
