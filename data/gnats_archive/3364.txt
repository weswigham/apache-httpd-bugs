Ok, I am not sure if this is a bug or anything, but for some reason it is not working in win95.
I get this error and would like to know what to do to get it to work.
 HTTPd: cannot determine localhost name.
 Use the ServerName directive to set it manually.
How would I fix it? Please be specific.

No, I am new at this stuff, and that is why I emailed here.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Nov  8 13:23:16 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is NOT an appropriate place to be asking such basic
configuration questions.  You are pointed to places such
as Usenet for such things before you submit a PR.

The ServerName directive is a directive that you have to
set.  Oddly enough, you should set configuration params for
Apache in the Apache config files which are in the "conf"
directory.

 Ok, First of all, I would like to tell you that you are really good at
 returning messages fast.
 Next, I would like to know where exactly is the file that I am
 supposed to edit?
 Thank you, 
 Mike Miller.

 The bug database is for bug reports, not for basic configuration
 assistance. We do not have the resources to individually tell everyone how
 to perform basic configuration of their server.
 
 As the bug reporting page says:
 
      If you're not sure that your problem is specifically related to a  
      bug in Apache (i.e., not something like a client problem or
      configuration problem), we strongly recommend that you check in the
      comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix or     
      comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows (depending on the platform
      being used) Usenet newsgroup first. If you don't receive a response
      within a few days, then please submit it to the Apache bug       
      database. If it's a known issue, you'll probably get a faster
      response from the newsgroup and you will help keep developer time  
      free for improving Apache. Most bug reports submitted are actually 
      user configuration problems that could be easily fixed by asking in
      the newsgroup.                                                    
 
      If you do not have access to a Usenet server, there are several web
      sites on the Internet that allow you to read and post to Usenet,  
      such as Deja News.                                              
 
 Please follow that advice.  It is there for a reason.
