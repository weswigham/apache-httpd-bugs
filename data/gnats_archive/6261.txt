>Environment:
win32 NT, jserv 1.1.2, JDK 1.2
>Description:
if you send more than one request to a servlet from one browser/host and the servlet has to do a lot of work (or a thread.sleep) the jserv module or the webserver mixes up the requests.
I have a frame layout and all frame contents come from the same servlet (but different URLs because different parameters like http://a.b.c/servlet/Servlet?p=1 or p=2 and so on). The servlet has a thread.sleep(200) before sending anything to the browser ans even before requesting the output writer.

is this a known behavior? how to solve this? please please give me feedback!
