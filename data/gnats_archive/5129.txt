>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, JDK 1.2.1_03, JSDK 2.0
>Description:
When trying to create a simple load balance group, I tried using just one 
ApJServBalance/ApJServHost/ApJServRoute combination to start.  Running 
a standalone worked just fine (I created an alternate mount point and pointed 
it to the same manually-started JVM using ajpv11://-----) but the load balanced
mount point failed, returning 'an error returned handling request via protocol
"balance"' as the result.  I had similar failures with two hosts.  Once I got 
up to three, the problems all went away.  Along the same lines, sending HUP
to the parent server process resulted in the children becoming zombie-ed for 
a while (until Apache sent SIGKILL).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
  I'm not sure if this is merely a design point that wasn't clearly documented.
All of the examples I see always have at least three ApJServHost-s in the 
config file.

 I started out using just PC1 and then PC1 and PC2; it seemed to start 
 working when I added PC3 (I made it PC2222 just to make sure there wasn't
 anything special about the names).  Using wget and inspecting the cookies
 that are returned, it seems that all the traffic is being routed through
 PC2222 with this config, regardless of the fact that PC1 has 9x more 
 weight in the load balancing algorightm.

State-Changed-When: Wed Oct 20 11:18:26 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
closed. mysteriously, appeared in 1.0 but solved (in 1.1) from the bur
reporter point of view after I told him to change the following :
 
StartServers 1
MinSpare = 1
MaxSpare = 2

Ever seen that configuration (was Unix) ?
With the lb "privileged target" this could be the reason. (The idea of
priviledged target was for a future socket "keepalive" implementation).

How do I close a bug ?
