Hi!

Problem The NoProxy directive seems to fail on other ports than :80.

relevant part of config file:
---
NoProxy       apollo.xxx.de     # IntraNet - Server
RemoteProxy  * http://firewall  # Firewall to Internet
---

Requesting    http://apollo.xxx.de     works fine.

Requesting    http://apollo.xxx.de:81  fails with...
 Error Msg: firewall reports "Server apoolo.xxx.de has no DNS"
           (because apollo is not visible to the firewall)

But apache proxy never should access the firewall for this request...
