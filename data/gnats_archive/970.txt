>Description:
I have tested this with serveral different types of files, including
GIFs, JPGs and HTML files and everything stops after only 16384 bytes
are read.  It appears that the connection gets closed at that point.

The headers, however, are returning the full length of the files.

http://tech.plinet.com/java/test/lookup.gif     (49K GIF)
http://tech.plinet.com/java/test/guestarc1.html (79K HTML)
 - Ignore any broken images, etc, I just wanted a large HTML files to test with
