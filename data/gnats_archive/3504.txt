>Description:
I'm make dbmmanage [filename] import [username:password] then he give me the 
follow errormassage :
Can't use empty password !
Then i try with [username password] the sam thing !

In the same configuration i've a problem with the Authentification directory
My access.conf Entries :
<Directory "/usr/local/dok/ada">
...
<Limit GET POST >
order deny,allow
allow from all
require valid-user
</Limit>
</Directory>

I've a indexfile in the directory /usr/local/dok and one in /usr/local/dok/ada
but the pull-down menu for the password i've when i pusch the indexfile from 
/usr/local/dok/ada. I'll be when i push the link from /usr/local/dok indexfile.
I hope you've a example for me !
