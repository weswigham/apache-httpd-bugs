State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Sun Jan 11 07:49:13 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is correct behaviour; the server looks for and
processes .htaccess files any time a document request
resolves to a file in the filesystem.  Otherwise the
only way you could tailor behaviour for subdirectories
under the DocumentRoot would be by modifying the server
config files, and then they wouldn't take effect until
you reloaded the server.

Thanks for your concern, and for using Apache!

 In addition, if you want to disable searching for them somewhere you can
 use AllowOverride None in your config file for that part of the fs.

 Subject: re: .htaccess is searched UNDER DocumentRoot
 
 Dear Colleagues,
 
 I know official state of this question is "closed" but I had problems
 with this behavior, I made some changes and would like to share my
 results.
 
 	Let's count:
 	o in standard installation with documents located in
 /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs apache tries to open .htaccess file in 5
 directories above the point where all documents are stored;
 	o in case of user www space (i.e. documents under
 /home/user/public_html) 3 opens;
 	o in case of expert installation (i.e.  /web/{cust1, cust2, ...,
 custN} - 2 opens.
 
 	If in any of these paths indirect automounter map is involved (I
 know - this is lame, but we do live in not perfect world)  -
 one risks to get his log filled with messages that system can't mount some
 .htaccess files for the simple reason that they do not exist.
 
 	Are these files used in practice in these places? IMHO on 99.9% of
 all servers - no (I may be wrong). The only use for them that comes to my
 mind is configuring hierarchies like:
 /web/
      cheap_plan_cust/
                     .htaccess
                     cust11/
                     cust12/
                     ....
      expensive_plan_cust/
                     .htaccess
                     cust21/
                     cust22/
                     ...
 
 	but even in this case it is possible to achieve required
 functionality by inspecting only a limited number of directories above
 corresponding document space (that could be configured at startup with
 default to 0).
 
 	So my patch tries to force server start search of access files
 from corresponding document root. It seams that it succeeds in case of
 server documents or ~user files. But can fail if rewrite module or some
 other module that maps URIs to filenames in funny way is in use. To handle
 this correctly it is necessary to make more global changes to server code
 (in particular - require that filename formation code separate path into
 2 parts - document root and path within document space).
 
 	You are welcome to use this patch in any way but I am not
 responsible for any consequences. I also will be happy to answer your
 questions and discuss further about this problem.
 
 
 Aidas

 I'm confused about why you don't just use "AllowOverride none" as I
 suggested before.  
 
 <Directory />
 AllowOverride None
 </Directory>
 <Direoctory /whatever/path>
 AllowOverride whateveryouwant
 </Directory>
 ... and so on.
 
 The problem with trying to guess where the documentroot is is that I'm not
 convinced you will always get it right.

 	This will not do what I want. If we have document root at
 /doc/root/dir and I ask for document /blah/blah/blah.html in standard way
 it will do
 
 stat("/doc/root/dir/blah/blah/blah.html");
 open("/.htaccess");
 open("/doc/.htaccess");
 open("/doc/root/.htaccess");
 open("/doc/root/dir/.htaccess");
 open("/doc/root/dir/blah/.htaccess");
 open("/doc/root/dir/blah/blah/.htaccess");
 
 	And I want it did:
 stat("/doc/root/dir/blah/blah/blah.html");
 open("/doc/root/dir/.htaccess");
 open("/doc/root/dir/blah/.htaccess");
 open("/doc/root/dir/blah/blah/.htaccess");
 	which is shorter by 3 sys calls.

 	Well. Hack alone can't reliably do that. But modules that maps
 URIs to filenames knows that info for sure. Why don't ask them to share
 this information with those that checks access?

 I'm sorry, why won't it do what you want?  I don't understand the problem.
 
 If you set AllowOvrride None it will not look for htaccess files.  Only
 set some other AllowOverride for paths inside your documentroot or
 wherever else you want to serve files.

 	Ok. It will do that I want. Sorry, I read docs not carefully
 enough. Thanks for your help.
