>Description:
PHP's parse_url was always failing on Linux Alpha.
This PHP code:
<?php
		$Url="http://www.sun.com/";
		$UrlElements = parse_url($Url);
		if( (empty($UrlElements)) or (!$UrlElements) )
		{
			$errmsg = "is_url: Parse error reading [$Url]";
			print "$errmsg\n";
		}

		$scheme		= $UrlElements[scheme];
		$HostName	= $UrlElements[host];

		if(empty($scheme))
		{
			$errmsg = "is_url: Missing protocol declaration";
			print "$errmsg\n";
		}


		if(empty($HostName))
		{
			$errmsg = "is_url: No hostname in URL";
                        print "$errmsg\n";
		}

		if (!eregi("^(ht|f)tp",$scheme))
		{
			$errmsg = "is_url: No http:// or ftp://";
                        print "$errmsg\n";
		}

		print "Scheme is $scheme, host is $HostName\n";
?>
was coming back with messages like this:
Warning: unable to parse url (http://www.sun.com/) in /usr/local/apache/htdocs/j/php/purl.php3 on line 12

I didn't really decrypt the configure complexities of PHP<->Apache regex
libraries, and I haven't broken regexes in Apache per se, but it looks
like PHP is using the Apache one, and I assume mod_rewrite uses regex
so it's probably a good idea to update it.  BTW, I also filed a bug
against PHP.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
>Fix:
I copied down a more recent version of regex from Henry Spencer's ftp site
(ftp.zoo.utoronto.ca) and made the obvious tweaks to replace the 1.3.6 version
with that.  After rebuilding, everything's OK now.  It looks like his version
is years newer, and he mostly mentions portability in the changenotes between
your version and the current one, so it makes sense.  Also, his tests
(make re;make r) pass on Linux Alpha in the newer version.
