>Description:
(1) configure script is inconsistent about config.layout location,
and fails if --enable-layout is specified.
line 3436 checks for $srcdir/config.layout.
 subsequent lines check $srcdir/../config.layout.
normally, $srcdir/../config.layout does not exist.

(2) on some systems, ". $pldconf" does not work.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --enable-layout=foo
>Fix:
(1) use $srcdir/config.layout, or $srcdir/../config.layout.  i guess the former is more correct.

(2) change "pldconf=config.pld" to "pldconf=./config.pld".
