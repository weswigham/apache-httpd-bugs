State-Changed-When: Sun Jan 11 11:38:09 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Yea, this is a broken compiler.  We will probably do something
to avoid this brokenness though...
State-Changed-From-To: analyzed-closed
State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Thu Jan 22 08:37:44 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This has been fixed, and should appear in the next release
after 1.2.5.  It is also fixed in the 1.3 stream, and
should appear in the next 1.3 release after 1.3b3.

Thanks for using Apache!
