Windows 95 (4.00.950) and NT4 Server SP3
Apache 1.3.6 straight from the distribution - not recompiled
Netscape 4.5
>Description:
When I run a simple script.

@echo off
echo Content-type: text.plain
echo.
echo Hello World.
echo.
exit

The output of the script is appearing in the same window that Apache is running
in and the browser reports an empty document, in Apache 1.3.4 I was getting the 
"Premature end of script headers" error.

But the same setup forklifted to NT works!

I've tried various programming languages in addition to batch commands, they all
fail on Win95 but work on NT. Am I alone in having this problem?

State-Changed-Why:
This bug should be resolved to this point.  If your script
closes and reopens the 'console', then this would be
expected behavior.  Please try the latest release of the
Apache server to determine if you can reproduce the problem.

State-Changed-Why:

As I indicated, we have made substantial revisions to the
CGI and process creation flags under Win95.  However, in
looking at this again, I am reopening the report until I
assure myself that this behavior is licked.  May also go
back to ViewCVS to see what exactly we did back then that
we shouldn't ever try again.

Please provide feedback if you are still having issues.
