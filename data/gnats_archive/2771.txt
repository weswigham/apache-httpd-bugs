I have the IIS listen on port 80. The apache is configured to
listen at port 80 also. At startup time I doesn't get an error message like:
port already in use.
If I stop IIS, start apache and then try to start IIS I get an error message that
port 80 is in use.

?
>Fix:
Test the used port at startup time!

 [...]
 I know that I break the default process flow of reporting bugs.
 
 But I think that this is a SERIOUS bug.
 1. If you have already running a public "production" server and you try
 to switch to apache without changing the config file the public server
 is no more reachable.
 2. It's a different behavior on the different OS (Unix, Windows).
 
 This would be a knock out criteria for business use. Please think once
 more abot it.
 
 Bye
 Klaus
