>Description:
During Startup and Shutdown, when Apache initializes modules, he works differently under Win32 and Linux.
My module has only 2 functions: module_init(...) and module_cleanup(...).
In module_init() I placed a call to ap_register_cleanup(...) for module_cleanup(). Il both modules I added a log call via ap_log_error(...) and my own log via fopen(...) fprintf(...) fclose(...).
Under Linux everything works right, when I look at error log I see the calls to mod_init(), mod_cleanup() two times, one of the first startup procedure (call it "Defensive Programming" -said Brian- ) and one for the actual -running- startup.
Under Win32 the log says:
mod_init() called
mod_init() called
mod_init() called
three times (yes) with no cleanup... under my own log I see:
mod_init() called
mod_cleanup() called
mod_init() called
mod_init() called
so three inits and 1 cleanup (after first startup) and NOT a final cleanup when server shutdowns.
>How-To-Repeat:
Alwais on Win32 machines (I tried also on a couple of other machines).
>Fix:
I'm looking around master_main() and service_main() under http_main.c... and code reflects logs...

 I found a "working" solution that probably could help in better resolving
 the problem...
 the pconf pool is never cleaned in the shutdown process, neither in "main"
 process, nor in "child" processes.
 I solved the problem adding these two lines:
 
 http_main.c Line 5036) ap_destroy_pool(pconf);
 (the last row of worker_main() procedure);
 
 This does not seem to hurt since under Win32 the pool is created at the
 beginning of the process (when it is spawned) via malloc() in function
 malloc_block() in file alloc.c.
 
 http_main.c Line 5484) clean_parent_exit(0);
 (the last row of apache_main() / REALMAIN() procedure);
 
 This seems to work since when apache_main() returns, it just return back to
 the Operating System.
