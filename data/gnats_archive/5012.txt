>Description:
[root@edgepro]:/usr/local/apache/bin> ./httpd
Syntax error on line 236 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_userdir.so into server: /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_userdir.so: undefined symbol: ap_os_is_path_absolute

1. This occured after I tried to create the Apache Server with DSO enabled.

2.> Another Iportant point would be that I was also trying to create mod_perl 1.21 as a DSO as well. I allow mod_perl to "modify" the configuration of the apache server build environment. I do not know if this problem is releated to mod_perl but it does seems suspicious.

3. The module loading order is the same as you have listed in you help files.

4. Since I used mod_perl the build environment "ALWAYS" create libraries to be linked in. The only This is the final line of the compile and link pahes of the build

gcc  -DLINUX=2 -DUSE_HSREGEX -O -mpentium `./apaci`   -rdynamic \
      -o httpd buildmark.o modules.o modules/standard/libstandard.a main/libmain.a ./os/unix/libos.a ap/libap.a regex/libregex.a  -lm -lcrypt -lndbm -ldl

5. I have been using htis same build scenario on a Solaris 2.5.1 system and it does build and load all modules. The only difference being the loading order of the modules. But, since the function ap_os_is_path_absoulte or it "real: name os_is_path_absolute is statically linked in I do not think it was load order related.

It does seem as if the library created from the src/os/unix dir is linked in as the function ap_os_is_path_absolute is located in os_inline.c

I freely admit that I may hve done something wrong. My concern is that I have not changed Any files and that all I have done is to change the location of the apache install to /usr/local/apache and added the -mpentium flag since the compile supports it.

This is all I can think of at the moment.

Please feel free to contact me for assitance or more information.

>How-To-Repeat:
I used the exapmle out of the apache documentation
 $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/apache \
                  --enable-module=rewrite \
                  --enable-shared=rewrite
    $ make
    $ make install

Also configure mod_perl 1.21 to be create using apxs and as a DSO.
    
>Fix:
I can simply create a macro to be included which does the same thing as os_is_path_absolute. THis can't be the right answer though. I must be doing something wrong.

 Rob,
 thanks.
 Your hint gave me the right idea,
 actually it is a bug in the header files of apache.
 (Reported in Sep 1999, PR# 5012, but never fixed.)
 
 Under certain circumstances (gcc compiler, unix) it
 will use a definition like
 	extern __inline__=20
 in os.h for ap_os_is_path_absolute().=20
 This way the function is not inlined with normal compiles=20
 and the compiler then relies on a library or in this case apache=20
 to have non-inlined version of the function for linking.
 
 Of course apache does not contain the function.
 And gcc does not do any linining without optimisation.
 If you switch on function inlining in the compile of=20
 fcgi_util.c (e.g. through enabling optimising), it works fine.
 
 You might want to add to the INSTALL files a hint,
 that
 	apxs -Wc,-O -o mod_fastcgi.so -c *.c=20
 might help, if you have problems with
 	/usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_fastcgi.so: undefined symbol: ap_os_is_path_absolu=
 te
 when trying to insert the module into apache.
 
 The real solution in the apache sources is=20
 to leave out the "extern" from the INLINE macro line 77 os.h (for unix)=20
 and add the "extern" to the empty ap_line macro in ap_config (line 104).
 
 	Bernhard

 Of course my proposed fix to the apache sources is untested.
