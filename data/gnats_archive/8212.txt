>Description:
Sometimes the server complains of bad syntax on two RewriteRule-lines with the result that the server doesn't start.
The lines (submitted below) are neaded as errorhandling for our proxyserver and works properly when the server accepts them.
Sometimes after "commenting out, restarting, putting back, restarting"-trialing the server may start as wanted.
It's curious when it seems to be randomly if the server starts or not.

The server is always started with 'apachectl startssl'

httpd.conf:
#trailing slash
RewriteRule ^/~([a-z0-9\-\.]*)(\/?)([a-z0-9\-_\/]*[^/])$ http://%{SERVER_NAME}/~$1$2$3/                 [R,NC]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}              !^/ssi
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}              !^/pics
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}              !^/cgi-bin
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}              !^/icons
RewriteRule ^/([a-z0-9\-_\/]*[^/])$     http://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1/                                       [R,NC]

>How-To-Repeat:
bin/apachectl startssl
bin/apachectl restart

But maybe you will not see any error, when it seems to be randomly if the error occurs or not.

 what _exact_ error is shown in the logs?

 (maybe this case should have be gone to mod_rewrite instead of general...)
 
 However, I found this in the errorlog:
 
 | [Sun Jul  1 23:37:00 2001] [warn] child process 6148 did not exit, sending another SIGHUP
 | [Sun Jul  1 23:37:00 2001] [warn] child process 6151 did not exit, sending another SIGHUP

 |
 
 I only found this hit in the logs. We've got this error a *couple* of
 times before and after this hit in the logs, so then I get a 2nd question:
  Why isn't these startup-errors logged?
 
 As I said, it seems to be *very* randomly if the error occures.
 The problem is always the same 2 RewriteRule-lines I sent from the
 beginning.
 The problem can occure both on clean startup and restart.
