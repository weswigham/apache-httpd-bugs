WinNT Client 4.0 with Service Pack 4
Latest Perl from ActivePerl
>Description:
I installed Apache 1.3.6 and modified my httpd.conf to have the options 
that have worked for me on my Linux box to serve standard Perl CGI scripts. 
I have the world's simplest perl script installed in the cgi-bin directory, 
and can execute it from the command line or by double-clicking it, so it's
properly associtade from Perl. I'm using FAT so I shouldn't have any
permissions problems. And the server serves pages fine. But if I try to point it
to my Perl script, it generates the following error in the log file:

[error] [client 129.74.75.173] (2)No such file or directory: couln't spawn child process: c:/www/physics/cgi-bin/hello.pl

even though that's the absolutely correct path to my executable.
I apologize if this is my misconfiguration mistake--I tried to play with all 
possible options in the httpd.conf file but to no avail. Could it be a 
problem with the server? Can you give me any hints where the problem
might be?
Thanks!
p.s.: I searched your faq, dejanews, and the problem report 
database first, naturally...

(but it just gives the standard error...)

Comment-Added:
Trt these two things:
1. Set the #! line in your perl script to the path to the 
perl.exe file on your system, or...
2. Check out the new ScriptInterpreterSource directive (it's i the doc...)

Let me know what you find.
