>Environment:
Win95
>Description:
Several SSI commands (FLASTMOD and FSIZE) do not work correctly using the "FILE=" parameter.
>How-To-Repeat:
Include the following line in any SHTML page:
<!--#flastmod file="$DOCUMENT_NAME" -->
>Fix:
In module mod_include.c there are #ifndef WIN32 wrappers around call to calls to ap_chdir_file(). These need to be removed.
