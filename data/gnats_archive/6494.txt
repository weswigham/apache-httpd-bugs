Unisys SVR4 level 1.3
>Description:
Undefined                       first referenced
 symbol                             in file
__llasgdivu                         ./libhttpd.so
_xttyname_r                         ./libhttpd.so
__llasgmul                          ./libhttpd.so
_xgetlogin_r                        ./libhttpd.so
ld: libhttpd.ep: fatal error: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to li
bhttpd.ep

>How-To-Repeat:
Port on SVR4 system
>Fix:
To solve these problems I had to change the src/Configure file and changed it as shown below (removing  -DCHARSET_EBCDIC)

    BS2000*-siemens-sysv4*)
        OS='BS2000'
        OSDIR='os/bs2000'
        # If you are using a CPP before V3.0, delete the -Kno_integer_overflow f
lag
        CC='c89 -XLLML -XLLMK -XL -Kno_integer_overflow'
#       CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DCHARSET_EBCDIC -DSVR4 -D_XPG_IV" 
        CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DSVR4 -D_XPG_IV"
        DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes
        DBM_LIB=""
        ;;

State-Changed-When: Tue Sep  5 15:08:59 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
What is the output of src/helpers/GuessOS on that machine?
And `uname -a`? I'm perplexed that you needed to change
the section for BS2000 in the Configuration file.

 The uname -a shows:
 unix_sv ua5200 4.0 2 PENTIUM P5/EISA
 
 The GuessOS returns:
 whatever-unisys-sysv4
