>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
NT4, SP6a, post6aSRP, MSI20
nothing else, completely new os installation
>Description:
after a 'successful' installation, apache is not registered as service.
the monitor is running and shows no installed services.
the shortcuts in startup->apache->config and startup->apache->control
are created but they doesnt work.

first, the shortcut 'Test Configuration' contains '-w' which is unknown
('Apache.exe: illegal option -- w'). after removing '-w' apache.exe 
terminates with an access violation.

the shortcuts for 'Restart', 'Start' and 'Stop' uses '-n "Apache2"' which
refers to the uninstalled service.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
if it is intended that the service is not registered by the installer
please show a message to inform the user. a message indicating a successful
installation is very misleading

implement '-w' or remove it (sorry, i am not familiar with the source code)

i removed '-d "c:\program files\....\Apache2\"' to avoid the crash. it looks
to me that it is a problem with the last '\'

btw. please correct the download path for MSI in the documentation. it still
points to version 1.10 but 2.0 is available for a while
