I am running  SCO 5.0.4 with the SCO Development system.
I have apache 1.3.3 with fronpage extension support compiled in (I did it)
Everything works fine until I have more than 42 virtual web sites.  If I add more than 42 then when I start the httpd daemon the frontpage extensions no longer work but the standard httpd (apache 1.3.3) engine still works for regular sites.  Can you point me in the direction as to where I can fix this problem.

Thank's

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... we have nothing to do with the frontpage extensions
and can do nothing to fix their broken nature.

What most sites using a larger number of virtual hosts do
is generate a fake config file for each vhost and point
the fp extensions for a particular site to that specific
config file.  That is MS's problem.

 THank's for the help.  I actually found out what the problem was.  It has
 nothing to
 do with the frontpage.  It just happened to seem to come from Fronpage.
 
 My problem was that the Apache engine is a single process that spawns child
 processes.  My SCO box was set to 110 files/per process.  Since I was
 opening two
 files per virtual website (error_log,access_log).  I quickly ran out of
 available
 files for the Apache process.  So I temporarely deleted the error_log files from
 the conf.httpd config.  And I will increase the limit of open files per
 process in
 the Kernel.
 
 Thank's for all your help.  Please continue doing all this great work on the
 Apache project.
