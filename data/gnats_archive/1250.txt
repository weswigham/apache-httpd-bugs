>Description:

I would like a compile-time option to use tcpd to deny or allow requests.

That would mean reading /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny (or other specifiable files) for hosts where connections would be allowed or not.

Running httpd out of /etc/inetd.conf is not efficient, so I would like to run one daemon that would check these files -- ideally on a `per hit' basis, so the /etc/hosts.* files could be changed on the fly without having to restart httpd.

Thanks

State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 21 15:16:09 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
1.3 should have essentially all the functionality of tcpd,
including double-reverse (paranoid) DNS, and netmasks.  See
the new_features_in_1_3.html on our website.

It's not easy at all to use /etc/hosts.allow in Apache due
to how it works (and how it's supposed to perform well).

 You don't need 1.3 to deny access to certain hosts, it just improves the
 facilities.  Read the documentation for mod_access.

 I've read it....
 
 Is that a per-directory basis, or can I setup for / and have it for the  
 entire site?
 
 Basically I want to allow connections only from IPs/domains I have  
 specifically said to allow.  How do I separate them?  Commas?  Spaces?
 
 order deny,allow
 deny from all
 allow from domain1.ext domain2.ext
 
 I'm assuming these are listed in the `.htaccess' file?
 
 If there are other places in the docs I should look, please feel free to  
 suggest... It's been a little crazy here.
 
 I believe that sshd has compile-time support for tcpd /etc/hosts(deny|allow)  
 which would be nice as it would mean only having to maintain one database of  
 allow/deny hosts.

 Uh, you mustn't have read it closely.  It says:
 
     Context: directory, .htaccess
 
 with each directive.
 
 There are also examples in conf/access.conf-dist which comes with apache.

 This, too, is covered in the documentation.
 
     Syntax: allow from host host ...

 sshd doesn't have to handle 700 requests per second.

 Sorry.... blame it on the strong blow to the head (been mucking with

 True enough, but neither does httpd (on my system).
 
 Point taken, however.

 This should work:
 
 <Location />
     order allow,deny
     deny from all
 </Location>
 
 Location is parsed after Directories.  This one always matches, and is
 always applied.

 Every child would have to stat /etc/hosts.allow on every hit and possibly
 reread it.  At least that's how tcpd normally behaves because it is always
 respawned.  If your argument for using /etc/hosts.allow is "because then
 it'd be controlled similar to other daemons" then you don't want to say
 "oh you have to restart your server if you change /etc/hosts.allow"...
 because that would be different from how other daemons work.
 
 Relax that condition and maybe you'll have a solution that can perform
 just fine.
 
 IMHO, it's a job for a 3rd party module, not something that we should
 ship with apache.
