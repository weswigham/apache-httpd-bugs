>Description:
I want to execute the 'exec cmd' for one environment file and then call the echo of 
environment variable for required path.I'm using the command in JavaScript1.1 code -
shell.value = '<!--#exec cmd=". /etc/prj.env; /usr/ucb/echo -n $PROJECT_HOME"-->/bin/LmpClientE';

Is this correct syntex ? Will it execute for apache server 1.2 ?
>How-To-Repeat:
example : 
shell.value = '<!--#exec cmd=". /etc/prj.env; /usr/ucb/echo -n $PROJECT_HOME"-->/bin/LmpClientE';

Is this correct syntex ? Will it execute for apache server 1.2 ?
