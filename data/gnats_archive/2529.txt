>Description:
Starting with 1.3b7 (also in 1.3.0), this appears in the error log:

 [warn] handler "server-parsed" not found, using default handler for: /home/jve/public_html/index.html

In src/CHANGES for 1.3b7:

  *) If a specific handler is set for a file yet the request still
     ends up being handled by the default handler, log an error
     message before handling it.  This catches things such as trying
     to use SSIs without mod_include enabled.  [Marc Slemko]

I have mod_include enabled and I have the SSI handler added in srm.conf:

  AddHandler server-parsed .html

I have Includes enabled in access.conf within a <Directory _documentroot_>:

  Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks

and the server-side parsing works just fine.

In my personal .htaccess (ouside the _documentroot_ path) I have:

  Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks Indexes

thus shutting off Includes for this directory.  The file is served just
fine, but there's that seemingly bogus warning message mentioned above.

I would have been under the impression that the server-parsed handler
would still be called, but would recognize that the Includes option is
off, and then just process it normally.  Certainly there's nothing wrong 
with turning off Includes for certain directories without having to jump 
through some hoop to avoid the warning.  So I did some investigating.

In mod_includes.c:send_parsed_file(), DECLINED is returned if the
Includes option is not set, assuming that the default handler will 
service the request.  OK.

In http_core.c:default_handler(), the warning is printed if r->handler
is non-null (i.e. set to "server-parsed" in this case).  <sniff> <sniff>
Smells like a kludge to me.  :)

In http_config.c:ap_invoke_handler(), if a specified handler is not found, 
*here* is where the error message should be printed, I would think.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Request a file with the defined "server-parsed" extension from a
directory with Includes turned off.
>Fix:
Something like this (assuming the test is removed from default_handler):
