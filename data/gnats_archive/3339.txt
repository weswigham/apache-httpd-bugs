This is the error message I am getting ???

mv: rename /usr/contrib/bin/suexec to /usr/contrib/bin/suexec.orig: No such file

As I already said in response to your Usenet posting,
you should be using "make suexec" instead, after having
configured Apache (ie. run Configure or configure).

You must be looking at some old docs if they are telling you
to do what you are doing.

 I am currently running BSDI 3.1, all patched and Perl version 5.003_95 . I 
 am trying to install the latest Apache with suexec. When I "make suexec" 
 from the ../apache_1.3.3/src/support directory, I get the following error 
 message. Please advise.
 
 main: {18} % make suexec 
 cc -O2 suexec.c -o suexec 
 suexec.c:74: ap_config.h: No such file or directory 
 *** Error code 1
 
 Stop. 
 main: {19} %

 As I already said in my initial response to this PR, you have to have
 configured Apache for compilation first with configure or Configure.  If
 you can't build Apache in the tree with "make", you won't be able to build
 suexec.
