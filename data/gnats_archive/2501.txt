Comment-Added:
Are you getting this message when you start the server, or
when you try to download the servlet after starting it
successfully?

I'm not sure what you mean by 'downloaded JRun servelet.'
Is this an Apache module that you're trying to load into
the server?

 Hi,
   Sorry for the download'ed' word. I think it will be
 more clear if I list down the steps:
 
 1) I install the Apache server 1.3b7 under my Window 
   NT4.0.
 
 2) Then I started it as a NT service.
 
 3) I managed to configure it and successfully get it 
   running.
 
 4) Then I install JRUN servlet (by Live Software,
 Inc)    ver2.1.3.
 
 5) I then reboot my system. When it boot up it prompt
    me an error and my Apache is not started.....
 
 Is the problem is on the Apache server or JRUN
 serlvet ? I think I want to try other servlet and
 draw my conclusion from this test.
 
 
 Regards,
 Thomas :-)

State-Changed-Why:
If there is only a problem when you add some third party
module, then we really can't support it because we have no
way to do what the other module is doing.  Please contact
the authors of jrun to see if they can help out.
