>Description:
I checked the bug report PR#1573 and followed the hint to add two lines
to the source of version 1.3b3. After compiling the CONNECT method
seemed to work fine.

But I seem to have a problem when using Raptor Eagle 4.0 on Solaris as
ProxyRemote. Parts of the desired document get delivered while other
parts just time out. This even happens when accessing our own webserver
in the segment local to the firewall (DMZ net).

I have a CERN 3.0A proxy/cache with SSL support (which I would like to
replace) which has no problems with the https method together with
Eagle. The funny thing is that the apache server works fine when I
configure the (internal) CERN 3.0A server as ProxyRemote to the apache.
So I have no clue wether the problem is related to the apache server or
to the Raptor Eagle or both.

Is anybody out there who has seen or fixed this problem? Any hints are
appreciated.

I did not receive any help from comp.infosystems..... Upgrading to 1.3b5 posed the same problem, so I do not know what to do next :=)


TIA for any help

What do you mean by "parts of the document" timeout?
Do you mean that a single file isn't fully downloaded, or
that some of the files required for a page (eg. images)
aren't downloaded at all?

Is there anything in the error log?

This is probably a problem with your firewall, but it is hard
to debug because we can't try replicating the situation...

 You bet it is....
 
 Well, I recompiled apache (1.3b5 w.o. patches since they do not seem to have
 any Impact on my Problem AFAIK)
 
 To sum up again: ProxyRemote our-fw-ip works for http
 but not for https
 
 ProxyRemote our-old-cern-proxy works for http AND https
 (old Proxy connects to our fw too)
 
 httpd writes into the logfile:
 
 > [Tue Mar 17 11:48:24 1998] [notice] httpd: caught SIGSEGV, attempting to dump
 > core in /home/karrerl/apache-bin
 
 Whenever I connect to a https server, Netscape brings up the
 'Document contains no Data' Error
 
 I know that it is quite hard to find a solution to such a problem. If you can
 tell me how to debug that situation, I will be more than willing to help you
 and contribute sth. to the apache project.
 
 BTW. Sorry that our first report was quite unclear. My Boss did the report in
 a hurry.
  
 PS: I did some snooping on our network, but could not find anything obvious
 that could be wrong with the Protocoll between proxy and client.

 That is bad.  If it can make Apache core dump, then Apache is broken no
 matter what the other software may be doing wrong.
 
 Do you have a core dump in the directory referenced?  If not, use the
 CoreDumpDirectory directive to change it to a directory that the user
 Apache runs as can write to, then see if you can get a core.  First
 compile your binary with '-g' in the EXTRA_CFLAGS.
 
 Do you have a debugger (gdb or dbx, etc.) on the system?  Do you know how
 to use it to see where it seems to be dying?

 Well, I recompiled Apache with the -g option.
 BUT, I cant get it to dump core! I startet httpd -d doc-root and set doc-root
 to 777 Mode. The Server didn't write the core file. I then created /test
 (also 777) on my machin (Local dir, no nis/nfs) set the CoreDumpDirectory
 to /test. Apache wrote in the error-file, that it is dumping core in /test
 but nothing happend....
 Do you have any hints. I know we won't get much further if we do not have at
 least a core dump.

 We have gdb installed, but I never have used it to that extent.
 
 My programming skills are basic (limited to what I am learning at the
 University) so I wont be to much help to you in that direction. But I am willing
 / test whatever is needed in our environment.

 Well, that did not seem to fix the problem. Same behavour of apache
 whenever I try to access https site.

 ### ERRATA ###
 
 I was a little bit too fast with my mail this Morning! After applying the
 mentioned patch, The proxy now runs with https, but still not satisfactory!
 
 When I visit sites with much pictures, (eg cdnow.com) some of the pictures
 just do not load. Netscape has the entry '100% of 22k, 200Bytes/s' in the
 status bar. Whenever I reload the page, the gifs do come out of the proxy.
 Sometimes tha page loads correct, sometimes there are again pics missing.
 (Not always the same as in the first run)
 
 In text-mode the browser does not seem to be having problems.
 
 I really asume that that this is a firewall Problem, but ......
 
 I will try to contact my vendor and file a report there... If you still have
 any suggestions, please let me know.
 
 Thanks for your effort,
 
 Lukas
