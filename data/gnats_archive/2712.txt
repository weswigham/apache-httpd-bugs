>Description:
i've written a module wich i've converted to use APXS style (i used to compile directly into apache)

if i link my module without ORACLE libs (and without ORACLE functionality ;-((( ) 
everything is fine, 
if i link it with oracle libs  (and then load it via LoadModule) it does not
show ut in the server-info and on server-shutdown i get 
[Sat Jul 25 23:33:13 1998] [error] Cannot remove module mod_htdl.c: not found in module list
in the error log...
>How-To-Repeat:
hmm, just checked -> if you have access to a sun with oracle8 you 
will get the same problem using the "normal" PHP3 module (without oracle - fine / 
with ORACLE - problem)
>Fix:
there seems to be a problem with the dl stuff.

State-Changed-Why:
Let me guess: The ORACLE library is itself a shared
library, right? If this is the case perhaps there
is a problem under Solaris+GCC-2.8 where the DSO
isn't liked correctly against the ORACLE library.
Usually ELF-based systems can link a DSO against
a shared lib, but only when the compiler and linker
work correctly together. Is there no error message
in the error_log when loading your DSO? Usually
you already should receive on when the  module is loaded...

 it's a shared lib, yes.
 and sorry, no weird mesage in the error_log.
 
 i could try to use the static ORACLE-Libs - would that be of any help to you?
