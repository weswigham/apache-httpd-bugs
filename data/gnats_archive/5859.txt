>Description:
I use the following config:

NameVirtualHost 192.168.252.1:9090

<VirtualHost 192.168.252.1:9090>
        UseCanonicalName        Off
        VirtualDocumentRoot     /web/content/%0/
        VirtualScriptAlias      "/web/content/%0/cgi-bin/"
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost 192.168.252.1:9090>
        ServerName olympus.mgmt
        DocumentRoot     /usr/local/docs
</VirtualHost>

As you can see I use mass virtual hosting and named virtual hosts 
(for exeptions).
Now when I request a document from one of my sites under /web/content 
(eg: http://<NAME>/doc.html), everything works as expected: the server 
goes to /web/content/<NAME>/doc.html, and when I request a doc from 
http://olympus.mgmt/test.html, it goes to /usr/local/docs/test.html.
Now when I switch the two definitions of virtual hosts around:
<VirtualHost 192.168.252.1:9090>
        ServerName olympus.mgmt
        DocumentRoot     /usr/local/docs
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost 192.168.252.1:9090>
        UseCanonicalName        Off
        VirtualDocumentRoot     /web/content/%0/
        VirtualScriptAlias      "/web/content/%0/cgi-bin/"
</VirtualHost>

When I now request the doc http://<NAME>/doc.html, the servers tries to 
find it at /usr/local/docs/doc.html, which is wrong. I'm using 
Netscape 4.7 as a client, so it sends a 'Host' header field along, so 
the problem is most certainly not there. It seems apache is looking for 
a defined "ServerName" but in mass virtual hosting this is not specified 
in the config, so it goes to the first virtual host definition found, 
which is wrong behaviour (or not documented) for mass virtual hosting.
Even better: if I define a ScriptAlias in the main config of apache, 
it overides the setting I specify in VirtualScriptAlias, in both 
config setups!

>How-To-Repeat:
Use a config similar as I described.

Nope, sorry

State-Changed-When: Wed Sep 20 15:01:05 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
This is expected behaviour. mod_vhost_alias wasn't designed
to work with NameVirtualHost, so the fact that the first
configuration works is a coincidence. It's a result of the
way that name-based virtual host configurations are looked up.
The first <VirtualHost> section is used if none of the others
match, so if you put mod_vhost_alias directives in the
second or subsequent name-based <VirtualHost> section they
will only work for one hostname (based on the ServerName
directive or the name(s) in the <VirtualHost> directive
itself), not lots of hostnames as you would wish.
