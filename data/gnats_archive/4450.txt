>Organization:
>Environment:
RedHat 5.2 with Linux 2.2.6 on an AMD K6 II, JDK 1.1.7a, JSDK 2.0
>Description:
I just can't find any of the Makefiles in which a javadoc statement is being 
exec'd, so I guess the lack of the API html files does not depend on my 
specific system configuration.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just follow your own instructions: in the base directory, do 
./configure --with-whatever-options-you-need
make
and then try and search for anything besides index.html in the docs/api/ 
directory...
>Fix:
I just put a simple script in the base directory, and exec'd it after make
(it works with both bash and tcsh):
#----------- BEGIN
BASE=`pwd`
cd src/java
javadoc -package -author -version -d $BASE/docs/api/ \
  org.apache.java.io org.apache.java.lang org.apache.java.net \
  org.apache.java.security org.apache.java.util org.apache.jserv
#------------ END
Of course, it would be nicer to have the same javadoc command inside the src/java
Makefile, for instance...
