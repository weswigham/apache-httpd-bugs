>Description:
Suppose you have apache on IP and only one global web (with "It worked..").
Someone looked it via SQUID proxy which cached the / dir. Then we created
virtual web on the same IP. The same person looked again but it have seen
the same old page. When I traced it using sniffit I found that SQUID sends
request with If-Modified-Since header with date 11/8 and length=1945.
New index.html was older but has DIFFERENT LENGTH. It seems the Apache tests
ONLY date and when file-date is older it doesn't check file length too.
It's not too serious bug, but probably it can make some headaches ..	
>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
Yep. Test for file length difference before sending 304 response ..
