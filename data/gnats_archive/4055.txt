When matching a regexp against $REQUEST_URI with SetEnvIf or SetEnvIfNoCase, 
the query string is truncated from the URI.

In my access.conf I've written:

SetEnvIf Request_URI test$ is_a_test
<FilesMatch test\..*>
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	Deny from env=is_a_test
</FilesMatch>

With this configuration, a request to
	http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/test.shtmltest
produces a 403 error as it should, but 
	http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/test.shtml?test
doesn't. And
	http://www.dagstuhl.de:8042/test.test?html
produces a 403 error, too, but it shouldn't.

The documentation in mod_setenvif.html says "Request_URI - the portion of 
the URL following the scheme and host portion". And when using <!--#printenv -->
$REQUEST_URI contains the query string while e.g. $DOCUMENT_STRING doesn't.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above. This URL should be available at least next week. If not, the server 
isn't for testing anymore and moved to port 80. :-)
>Fix:
- Update documentation in mod_setenvif.html to "Request_URI - the portion of 
  the URL following the scheme and host portion, but in comparsion to 
  mod_include.c without the query string" (But IMHO this solution would be 
  quite inconsistent!)
- Or match $REQUEST_URI without trucated query string against the regexp
- Or rename REQUEST_URI in mod_setenvif.c into DOCUMENT_URI

But I would be glad, if the fix would include a regexp matching against the 
query string in any way.

BTW: The documentation doesn't exactly tell me all of the available environment
variables I can use with SetEnvIf, it just says "including the following:" or 
"Some of the more commonly used request headers are:" or "Example:". No where
is mentioned, that I can't use e.g. $QUERY_STRING, although this is IMHO a 
"more commonly used request header"... It would be nice, if all available 
variables would be listed.
