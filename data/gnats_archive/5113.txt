>Description:
Can't compile "org.apache.java.recycle.pool.Worker" class correctly in the case of ja (japanese) locale.

A "Worker.java" file uses an iso-8859-1 specific character in the line 171 for debugging. But javac can't convert this character correctly in the case of ja locale and report an error message.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set ja locale (ex. setenv LANG ja)
>Fix:
Use anothor ascii character instead of the iso-8859-1 specific character.
