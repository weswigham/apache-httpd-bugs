>Environment:
SERVER : RedHat Linux 6.2 (kernel 2.2.14)   /   CLIENT : Windows
Note : This security problem appears with MSIE 5.00.2614.3500
       and *NOT* with Netscape Navigator 4.5 Windows or Linux
>Description:
I use <Location> directive to deny direc URL access.

# ALLOW ACCESS http://servername
<Location />
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Location>

# DENY ACCESS http://servername/subdir
<Location /subdir/>
order deny,allow
deny from all
</Location>

It works when you try to directly access a file in the subdir by typing the URL.
Apache return a 403 ERROR, as we can expect.
BUT
if you use the browser "history previous" button and then click the "history next" button, the denied page is displayed all the same !

Even if this problem is not due to apache server, it may be useful to prevent access to denied pages from MSIE browsers
>How-To-Repeat:
try to access http://chaloin.dyndns.org/content/common/test.php
this page will display the phpinfo() of PHP4
The 'content' directory is denied.

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly due to caching in the browser.
Apache is doing nothing wrong.
Thanks for using Apache.
