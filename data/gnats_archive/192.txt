>Environment:
AIX 4.1.5 on RS/6000 with IBM cc as compiler
>Description:
I have defined a 10,000+ user htpasswd file for authentication. It
seems that some on the users are getting "Authentication denied" while
other are not. Is there some limit on size for a flat text htpasswd file
that I am hitting? If there is a limit, is DBM the only work around?
>How-To-Repeat:
This is on an IBM internal machine so a URL is not possible. If you set
up a protection with 11,000 or so users the problem should occur.
>Fix:
Nope :-%2

State-Changed-Why:
There should be no limit.  I just tested one with 
100000 entries (FreeBSD; latest beta), both with the 
entry I was using as the first and last entry and it 
worked fine, although is awfully slow.

There _are_ limits on the group files.  Are you using
any group files that could be running into limits?  

In any case, I would _strongly_ recommend using something
like DBM files for that number of entries; it doesn't 
just look them up once for the first request, but for 
every page requested from within the passworded files.
DBM files are _much_ faster, although it may take a little
effort to get it compiled properly on some platforms.
