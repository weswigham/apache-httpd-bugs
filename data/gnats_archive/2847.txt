>Environment:
Apache under both Linux 2.0.30 and NT 4.0.
>Description:
When clicking on a BMP file "garbage txt" is displayed on screen.  After saving the link and looking at it locally, the image is "warped" and the filesize is different than the source.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put a BMP file onto any Web site running Apache and try viewing it.
>Fix:
Add the following line to the "mime.types" file:

image/x-MS-bmp  bmp

It's not really a "bug" but a pretty strange omission that support for BMP files does not come as part of the default Apache install.  Granted this may be a Netscape specific mime type (I'm not sure) but it should at least support Netscape and IE...
