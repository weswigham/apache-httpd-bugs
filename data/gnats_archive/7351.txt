 The natural way to revitalise mind and body!
 
 Readers Digest Oct 2000 – Well being
 
 
 Office buildings with pure air circulation are a high-risk environment
 because viruses can’t escape. What’s worse, low humidity dries out the
 mucous membranes that, when moist, trap viral invaders and dispose of
 them. 
 
 One antidote is to take a breath of pure oxygen 
 
 Using the compact Opur Oxygen canister containing 99.5% pure oxygen
 counters the effects of pure air circulation
 
 You can only buy it on-line from www.pure-oxygen.co.uk
