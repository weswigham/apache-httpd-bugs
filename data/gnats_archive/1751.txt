http://corona.celestar.com <--- go there.  then go here ---> http://207.201.65.4
nslookup 207.201.65.4   and    nslookup corona.celestar.com

State-Changed-Why:
Your server is running Apache 1.2b7.  There were various vhost
fixes after that point.  Please upgrade to Apache 1.2.5 and
check your problem again.

You should also read the htdocs/manual/vhosts-in-depth.html
manual page that comes with the server, specifically the
"What works" portion.

Thanks for using Apache!
