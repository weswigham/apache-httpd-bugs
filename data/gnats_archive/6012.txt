>Description:
   I've just had to stop/start (i.e. restart was not enough) the Apache
server on ukwsv1 (ukw3t2).  It was producing this in the error logs for
all CGI scripts.  [HTML files were being served Ok].


[Wed Apr 19 11:46:01 2000] [error] [client 147.184.219.175]
  (24)Too many open files: couldn't spawn child process: 
   /GGR-WWW/cgi-bin/test-env


   The status showed this, so I suspected that it is a problem with it
failing to shut one filehandle at each soft restart.  However, I can't
reproduce this.....

Server Version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) ApacheJServ/1.0 mod_perl/1.21
Server Built: Aug 20 1999 13:50:44

Current Time: Wednesday, 19-Apr-2000 11:44:09 BST
Restart Time: Wednesday, 01-Sep-1999 14:10:53 BST
Parent Server Generation: 245 
Server uptime: 230 days 21 hours 33 minutes 16 seconds
Total accesses: 46731 - Total Traffic: 569.7 MB
CPU Usage: u4.9 s2.73 cu534.2 cs32.96 - .00288% CPU load

1 requests currently being processed, 5 idle servers



The server is configured with:
 MaxRequestsPerChild 30

The default Open Files limit is 200 for this system.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure.

Just doing 250 restarts (5 second pauses between each) didn't reproduce it.
Neither did doing another 300 while moving the log files befor each restart.

Sorry I can't be more helpful.....
