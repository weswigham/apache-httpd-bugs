>Unformatted:
It seems that the problem of dying httpds on RedHat 5.0 is solved by:

  Upgrade to glibc-{devel-}2.0.7-4
  Recompile apache (rpm --rebuild ...)

In other words: The bug is/was in glibc.

The server has now been up for 30 hours. Before the compile, the server
would die after max 6 hours.
