>Description:
There is an error in the configure script in the root of the distribution:
src/Configuration is referenced incorrectly, and instead of it, there are
references to Configuration.tmpl that is the template.

I've spent 3 hours modifing src/Configuration and couldn't figure out why
changes were not reflected during compile. Then i looked the configure script
and noticed this error.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
cat configure | sed 's/Configuration.tmpl/Configuration/g'

State-Changed-Why:
Please read the instructions.  It is clearly documented that
if you use the "configure" method to configure Apache,
you can not edit the Configuration file.

If you want to edit the Configuration file, you have to
use src/Configure
