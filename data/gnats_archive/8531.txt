>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Linux / RedHat 7.1 dist
>Description:
When "cleaning up" PATH_INFO for a CGI script, Apache fails to gobble up "//"
entries.  While not a real problem in itself, it treats "//" as a first-class
path component when gobbling up "../" entries.  This means that a CGI script
passed a path "/bar//../baz" is now passed "/bar/baz" instead of the correct
"/baz".
>How-To-Repeat:
With a trivial CGI script:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  my $filePath = $ENV{PATH_INFO};
  print "Content-Type: text/plain\n\nInitial file path: $filePath\n";

Then (if the script is http://host/cgi-bin/test.cgi) perform GETs of
http://host/cgi-bin/test.cgi/foo//../bar
>Fix:
Gobble up "//" first.
