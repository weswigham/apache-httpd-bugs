>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.4, built using gcc 2.7.2.1,
SunOS vortis 4.1.4 5 sun4
>Description:
The ErrorDocument configuration option returns redirects for non-existent pages,
when an absolute URL is specified. This is hinted at in the documentation, but
I feel it is a serious problem, as it can lead to servers where every incorrect
document on the server looks, to a search engine, like it is a correct (if
redirected) response. 

This behaviour merges the 4xx and 3xx return codes until they are virtually 
useless.
>How-To-Repeat:
Go to any site with an external ErrorDocument and look at the response from an
incorrect URL.
>Fix:
Either get rid of this (I can see way this would be hard though :-), or include
a warning in the documentation about how bad it is to return a redirect for
a document that doesn't really exist

What can I say except "don't do that!" ?  :)  The server can't

 Would it be possible to add in the documentation something explaining the
 dangers of error redirects, so people are at least warned of the problems?
 
 Cheers,
 
 Simon
