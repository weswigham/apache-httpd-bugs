gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Apache is configured as proxy; no local documents are to be served.
When the client provides username:password in a ftp-request, apache
interprets the username as its local hostname - apparently because
the username happens to match de domainname of the proxy - and tries
to serve a local document, which doesn't exist.

e.g.: 'ftp://apache:xxxxx@some.foreign.dom/' when the proxy is in
domain 'apache.org'.
>How-To-Repeat:
Lets say your proxy server is 'proxy.apache.org'.
Let your client request 'ftp://apache:xxxxx@some.foreign.dom/'.
The proxy will reply '404 Not found'. If you modify the username
to no longer match your domain, the request will get passed on.
