>Organization:
>Environment:
Using Windows NT, SP 4 with Apache 1.3.6 (binary provided by www.apache.org).  
>Description:
Included the line 
ProxyPass /foobar/ ftp://foo.bar/
in httpd.conf (along with the appropriate LoadModule call upstream in the file).
When a client calls for the URL http://myserver/foobar/, Dr. Watson issues a 
popup at the server reporting an application error:  "Exception: access 
violation 0xc0000005, Address: 0x008e800a".  The same problem occurs with 
Apache versions 1.3.2, 1.3.4, and 1.3.6.
Nothing is reported in the Apache error.log file.  

No problems are observed with ProxyPass to http sites, only ftp sites.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try ProxyPass /foobar/ ftp://foo.bar/  (using a url to a real ftp site instead) 
and give it a whirl.
>Fix:
No, please help!
