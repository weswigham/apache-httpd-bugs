>Description:
here is the "300 Multiple Choice" message I get: 

The document name you requested (/course_info/course_info/schedules/medical.html)
could not be found on this server.
However, we found documents with names similar to the one you requested.

Available documents: 
     /course_info/course_info.html/schedules/medical.html (common basename) 

The issue is that /course_info/course_info.html is a file which exist, but
it is not a directory. clicking on the proposed link returns a 404 error.

In this case, valid answers should be:
     /course_info/course_info.html       (this one would suit me) 
or   /course_info/schedules/medical.html (rather difficult to guess)

However, this mod_speling module is great ! 

Best regards
Marc
>How-To-Repeat:
See example above

Same whoud occure with  /course_info/schedules/medical/html
It would return  /course_info/schedules/medical.html/html

This is based on actual typos I found in my web log files.
>Fix:
When finding a matching file in place of a directory, remove anything after it.

State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 27 12:23:16 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Neglecting everything past the end of a file name is not a
good idea, and can break scripts and SSI files.  This data
is interpreted as PATH_INFO for those files, and throwing it
away would not be good.

Thank you for using Apache.
