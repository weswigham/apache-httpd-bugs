SunOS ultra 5.6 Generic_105181-13 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
>Description:
If two modules are have same function name define in them the Solaris 
operationg system always uses the first definition available at run-time
as these modules are loaded using RTLD_GLOBAL flag, which leads to 
core dump.

However it works fine if I load them using RTLD_LOCAL flag in ap_dso_load() function in file src/os/unix/os.c.

That means each module code space is not protected by Apache web-server
at run-time, unless I modify the Apache source code itself, which I 
can not do as my modules will be used for proprietory purposes.

>How-To-Repeat:
Load two modules using DSO mechanism which have a same function defined in
them with different body or use dlopen function in one of them. And get a
happy core dump.

>Fix:
Parameterize the dlopen flags for "LoadModule" directive to 
specify the scope(RTLD_GLOBAL or RTLD_LOCALE) of the module 
to be loaded in the httpd.conf file.

State-Changed-Why:
Using RTLD_GLOBAL is necessary to support some features of
modules like mod_perl. Work-arounds include declaring the
functions in your module static, or choosing properly
unique names for the functions.
Thanks for using Apache!

 Hi,
 
 Thanks for the reply.
 
 What I meant was NOT to hard code that flag to RTLD_GLOBAL or something. Let the
 
 user specify(RTTD_GLOBAL/RTLD_LOCAL) what he wants in the httpd.conf file. And
 pass this value as a parameter to ap_dso_load() function.
 
 You can always keep the default value to RTTD_GLOBAL so that existing modules
 will
 work. Right!

 If you can provide a patch we may consider it. However I doubt it will
 go into 1.3, so providing a patch against 2.0 would be better.
