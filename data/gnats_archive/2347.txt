build commands were:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/etc/apache \
--enable-modules=most --enable-shared=max
>Description:
uncommenting ScriptAlias in srm.conf gives "Invalid command" error when starting
the server.

There were no errors reported by configure. There were a series of
"statement is unreachable" compiler warnings on "break" statements for engine.c.
There was one other warning:
"http_protocol.c", line 302: warning(1184): possible use of "=" where "==" was

         intended

           ((r->proto_num >= HTTP_VERSION(1,1)) && (r->chunked = 1))) &&

other than that the compilation and install went smoothly.

The srm.conf line reads:
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/

the httpd.conf has
LoadModule cgi_module         libexec/mod_cgi.so
uncommented.

But when the server is started the message:

Syntax error on line 148 of /usr/local/etc/apache/etc/srm.conf:
Invalid command 'ScriptAlias', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
/usr/local/etc/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

is received.

First, please verify that this still occurs with 1.3.1 of
Apache.  If it does, please mail the srm.conf file to
me at <coar@Apache.Org>.
