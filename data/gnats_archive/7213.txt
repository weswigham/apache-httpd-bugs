The is the log from mod_jserv.log
[07/02/2001 04:05:09:329] (INFO) spawn ap_standalone, getppid = 1 10829
[07/02/2001 04:05:09:329] (INFO) Apache-JServ 1rst  initialization: JVM will be started later 1 10830 10829
[07/02/2001 04:05:09:336] (INFO) Apache Module was cleaned-up
[07/02/2001 04:05:09:352] (INFO) spawn ap_standalone, getppid = 1 10830
[07/02/2001 04:05:09:352] (INFO) Apache-JServ 1rst  initialization: JVM will be started later 1 10831 10830
[07/02/2001 04:05:48:069] (INFO) Apache Module was cleaned-up

Please notice that I added some debugging statement in jserv_wrapper_unix.c.
The problem is that the mod_jserve should go to start JVM instead of going
back to the 1rst initialization again.

The problems happended to 3 solaris machines that I have but looks fine on
the other two machines. 
>How-To-Repeat:
I built apache1.3.14 + mod_jserv by following the instruction exactly.
It is difficult to reproduce because it is machine dependent.  But once
it happended, it always happend on that machine.
>Fix:
It might be Solaris problem but I suspected timing problem.  I have the code
on jserv_wrapper_unix.c that I modified if that is helpful.
