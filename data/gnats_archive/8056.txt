Linux dugite 2.4.6 #2 Sun Jul 8 10:59:14 WST 2001 i586 unknown

I'm running Red Hat Linux 7.1, and the version is the one I installed when I upgraded RHL 6.2 a few hours ago.

>Description:
I'm trying to start apache under my own account - that is, I don't have root privilege. Apache is trying to open/create files in /var before its read the configuration file.

Here's what happens:

[summer@dugite summer]$ strace -e trace=open,read,write -f -f /usr/sbin/httpd -d http -f http/conf/httpd.conf
open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
open("/lib/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\320J\0"..., 1024) = 1024
open("/lib/libcrypt.so.1", O_RDONLY)    = 3
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\300\21"..., 1024) = 1024
open("/lib/libdb-3.1.so", O_RDONLY)     = 3
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\200\364"..., 1024) = 1024
open("/lib/libdl.so.2", O_RDONLY)       = 3
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\314\37"..., 1024) = 1024
open("/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0H\277\1"..., 1024) = 1024
open("/var/run/httpd.mm.1910.sem", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0600) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
write(2, "Ouch! ap_mm_create(1048576, \"/va"..., 61Ouch! ap_mm_create(1048576, "/var/run/httpd.mm.1910") failed
) = 61
write(2, "Error: MM: mm:core: failed to op"..., 101Error: MM: mm:core: failed to open semaphore file (Permission denied): OS: No such file or directory
) = 101
[summer@dugite summer]$

there's the additional point that I don't see a directive relevant to semaphores anyway.

>How-To-Repeat:
I was going to say create a configuration file, but as it's not read, that isn't needed.

Just run it as an ordinary user seems enough from here.
>Fix:
I'm not really a C programmer; I can't really do more than state the obvious.

State-Changed-Why:

By default, apache does not put anything in /var/run,
so you must have a version modified by redhat.
You are probably best off compiling a version for
yourself so that you can set all the options you
want.

In any case, the problem appears to be the "Lockfile"
directive in httpd.conf.  Change or add this directive
pointing to a place where you have write permission.

In the future, please take questions like this to
news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix before
posting to the bug database.

Thanks for using Apache!
