  DEC OSF1 no patches, using GNU gcc 
uname output ---> decserver.etc 1.2 10 alpha
>Description:
This isn't a bug, I know, but I have to have Apache running in a few days and have not gotten any replies on my newsgroup  queries. I thought  of you guys as a last resource  Gcc outputs a series a syntax errors and aborts right after alloc.c   which is the first file that is processed though gcc. I thought it could be different memory allocation procedures that had to be changed in OSF1 but did not dare to make the changes myself, since my programming skills are not very sharp.
Please enlighten me as to what might be wrong. There;s no binary for OSF1 in the apache.org binaries directory which leads me to do the making of it myself.

The reason I gave a hotmail e-mail address is because I have just moved from Rome and dont yet have a fixed e-mail here.

I appreciate any pointers.

Best regards,
J. Fonseca

State-Changed-Why:
If you want help, you really need to tell us what is going
wrong!  "a series of syntax errors" doesn't tell us anything.
Contrary to popular belief, the exact error messages do have
meaning.  Without them, we can do nothing...
