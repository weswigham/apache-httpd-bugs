>Description:
I have in srm.conf:

Listen 80
Listen 8000

<VirtualHost *:80>
ResourceConfig /etc/opt/apache/srm.conf
AccessConfig   /etc/opt/apache/access.conf
ErrorLog       /var/opt/apache/logs/error.log
TransferLog    /var/opt/apache/logs/access.log
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:8000>
ResourceConfig /etc/opt/apache/stud-srm.conf
AccessConfig   /etc/opt/apache/stud-access.conf
ErrorLog       /var/opt/apache/logs/stud-error.log
TransferLog    /var/opt/apache/logs/stud-access.log
</VirtualHost>

However, the <VirtualHost> directives don't seem to have an
effect. Did I understand the description about Listen wrong
(http://www.apache.org/docs/bind.html)?

What I like to have is 1 server which serves 2 different
ports on the same host (same IP addresses) but with different
config files for each port.
