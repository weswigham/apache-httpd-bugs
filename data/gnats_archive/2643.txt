Configuring Apache for use with suexec wrapper.
Syntax error on line 26 of /usr/local/apache/etc/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_env.so into server: ld.so.1: /usr/loca
l/apache/sbin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod
_env.so: symbol ap_palloc: referenced symbol not found
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started

if I comment out mod_env.so get similar error on mod_log_config.so 
and ap_psprintf.  
>How-To-Repeat:
uncertain. currently am successfully running apache 1.2.6 on this server.

State-Changed-Why:
I cannot reproduce this under Solaris 2.6 with GCC 2.7.2.
Can it be that your GCC version doesn't match exactly
your Solaris version (compare uname with gcc -v)?

 Here's the output I get from both.
 The recommended patches have been applied to the system as well.
