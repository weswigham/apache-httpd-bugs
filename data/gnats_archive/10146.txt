CYGWIN_NT-5.1 LATRONUM 1.3.10(0.51/3/2) 2002-02-25 11:14 i686 unknown

I'm using Windows XP, cygwin 1.3.10, with apache 1.3.22
>Description:
After starting apache the error_log begins to grow indefinitely. It's contents are the following:

As can be seen, there seems to be a problem in the module mime_magic, as well as in the sync with the child process.

I don't know if this is a general problem or if it only happens under windows XP...

When I commented the lines in httpd.conf that included mod_mime_magic the same error began to appear but for cyggdbm.dll...
