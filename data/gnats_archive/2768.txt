>Description:
I am testing Apache 1.3.1 before I fully upgrade from Apache 1.2.6.  Once I configure it and install it, I try to start it, and everything works fine.  However, the minute I add a virtual host (we only have one IP address, and we bind any domain and subdomain to our IP, and asking for more IPs has been a pain), and that one virtual host reads for any request from any domain (i.e. test.burghcom.com will show up in place of the content on www.burghcom.com, asg.burghcom.com, www.bkhs.org, etc.).  I have combed over the configuration of the test server, and recompiled it.  Any ideas?

State-Changed-Why:
You need to read the vhost docs, paying particular attention
to the NameVirtualHost directive and how it does (or doesn't)
interact with the main server.
