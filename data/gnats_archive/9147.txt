apache
>Environment:
Redhat 7.1 fresh install with all dev rpms.
>Description:

From a fresh Linux install (or non fresh if you like), if you compile apache 
with mod_auth_db, you can create a Berkeley DB3 .db file with some username/password (I use
Perl compiled with Berkeley DB3), and have a .htaccess file point to it
and everything works fine. However if you compile apache with mod_auth_db and 
mod_rewrite, apache no longer authorizes the same users.
>How-To-Repeat:
With Berkeley DB3 installed (this is default with dev rpms on redhat 7.1), create
a .db access file (I use a perl script to do this) with a username/password.
Compile apache with mod_auth_db and create a .htaccess file that points to the
.db file, and confirm that you can correctly access the protected directory.
Now recompile apache with both mod_auth_db and mod_rewrite, and try to access
the same directory, and it will deny access.
