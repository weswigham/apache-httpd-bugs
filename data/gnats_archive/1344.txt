SunOS 4.1.3_U1
gcc version 2.7.2.2
>Description:
When srm.conf has the lines:
    UserDir public_html
    # security option strongly recommended in Apache documentation
    UserDir disabled root
all URLs using "~userid" translate to directory ~userid/root
rather than ~userid/public_html.  One workaround is to comment
out the line "UserDir disabled root".
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, it's hidden behind the firewall.
>Fix:
Check "mod_userdir.c"?  Or just tell people not to use "UserDir disabled root"
in their srm.conf files.  Note: That line was not in the distributed version
of srm.conf, but was in the documentation for UserDir when Apache 1.2.1
was released.  The mod_userdir.html#userdir documentation now recommends
using that "disabled" line for Apache 1.3 or above.  (Maybe someone already
found this problem in Apache 1.2.4?  I didn't see it in the bug list.)

 It now looks like I made a mistake approximately Aug. 5, 1997
 while reading one of the apache.org web pages such as:
   http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_userdir.html
 or:
   http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/security_tips.html
 Since those pages have not changed since Sun, 06 Jul 1997
 I must have not noticed on Aug. 5 that the srm.conf line:
     UserDir disabled root
 was recommended only for versions 1.3 or above.
 
 Thus, my only possible remaining suggestion is that in addition
 to strongly advising use of that line in 1.3 or above, you also
 strongly advise _not_ using it before 1.3. :-)
 
 Sorry for the bother.  You can close this PR.  Thanks.
