Windows 95, MSIE Internet-Explorer 5.0, Apache 1.3 under Red Hat Linux 6.0
>Description:
The Problem is, that, wenn a User have MSIE 5.0, the Environment variable 
HTTP_REFERER or HTTP_COOKIE didn't work. With MSIE 4.0 there are no problems.

Is this a known client problem? I have didn't found any bugfixes and reports in
the database, but I need a fix for this problem.

State-Changed-Why:
If a client doesn't send the headers, then the client doesn't
send them.  Apache can't do much about that.

I can tell you that IE5 _does_ send cookies and referer
headers just fine.  Be sure you aren't being mislead by
some special circumstance such as a proxy or using a beta
version of IE.
