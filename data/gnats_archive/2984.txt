Well, actually this is a problem report concerning 
problem reports in generasl.

I encounterde the echo problem, too. (I'm running the
latest bash version.) The second configure replacement
in the above mentioned PR# 2564 fixed the problem, but
first I had to substitute all occurrences of
"&gt;" and "&lt;" with the appropriate redirection
symbols. Seems to be a false html to text conversion.

Someone seems to write his emails in html. Wouldn't it
be better to send emails containing lots of special
in plain text format?

But, however, the fix was ok.

State-Changed-Why:
It is supposed to be HTML; the results page is HTML, you
have to use something that understands HTML to view it.
If the characters weren't replaced, then it would not
be proper HTML and would not be viewable in a HTML client
as it is supposed to be.

Whatever you use to fetch the patch and save it to disk
needs to be told to convert it from HTML to text before
doing so.
