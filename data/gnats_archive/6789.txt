SunOS rubicon 5.8 Generic_108528-01 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10

Ultra10, Solaris8 in 64-bit, EGCS/GCC 2.96 (2.95.2 w/ 64-bit support)
>Description:
With both apache 1.3.12 and 1.3.14+mod_perl, the child processes die with the following error whenever it tries to index a directory with 1 or more files that are over over 1mb in size:

[Thu Nov  2 12:52:30 2000] [notice] child pid 27763 exit signal Bus Error (10)

Using mkfile to see at which point it breaks, it is as soon as it reaches exactly 1m in size.  'mkfile 1m test' breaks it, 'mkfile 999k test' and it works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Get it to properly index large files on Solaris8/64-bit  =)  apache is compiled 32-bit, however.

Did you compile your server on 64bit Solaris? Are you talking
about directory indexes created with mod_autoindex?

 Yes, the server is running 64-bit Solaris but apache is compile as a
 32-bit application.  Directory indexing is specified with the "Options
 Indexes" option in the <Directory> directive, I'm not using the autoindex
 module.  It's a virtually stock conf file with the addition of
 virtualhosts and an added AddHandler to handle .cgi files.

I'm changing this back to "open" because the reporter
responded and I have seen other similar reports.
There does seem to be a problem with mod_autoindex
under solaris with very large files.
