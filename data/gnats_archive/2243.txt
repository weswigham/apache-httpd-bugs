>Environment:
SunOS 5.5.1, i86pc, compiled with GCC Compiler
>Description:
I am using the ".htaccess" to setup file and directory descriptions. I did not see a limit on the amount of text that Apache reads and writes for the AddDescription option of FancyIndexing. Here is an example:

This is an excerpt from my Apache Generated Index:

 annoyances/            14-May-98 15:51      -  Annoying things to do >

the ">" shows up when there is still about another 25 letters to go. If I can edit this or fix this please tell me. Thanks. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Actually the server is behind a firewall, so there isn't a way you can check it out. I gave an example above of what is happening. If more info is needed simply contact me via e-mail. Thanks again.
>Fix:
None at the moment.
