Give this error, while it was working fine with 1.3b6 (and 1.3b3)
[Mon Jun 01 13:47:50 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: d:/home/http/cgi-bin/ls.pl
The script begin with:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
There is a file in D:\usr\local\bin\perl5.bat (I created it in C: too)
The batch file call Perl (so I don't have to modify the CGI to u/l them on
the Unix server)
When I change line for:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.bat
I get:
[Mon Jun 01 13:43:17 1998] [error] Premature end of script headers: d:/home/http/cgi-bin/ls.pl
I just found out, that Apache seem to clean environment... 
(perl is not in PATH anymore, that fix one problem...)
However it seem that the others environment variable don't get passed...
