>Description:

On the page

http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#addtype

it states:

"Note that, unlike the NCSA httpd, this directive [AddType] cannot be used to
set the type of particular files."

It would be useful to include this information on the NCSA compatability
page:

http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/compat_notes.html
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A
>Fix:

Add this information to the NCSA compatability notes page:

http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/compat_notes.html

Thanks!
