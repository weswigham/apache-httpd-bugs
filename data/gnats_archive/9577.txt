 For kicks, let's trash pro soccer
 
  
 
 Long Island, NY - January 23, 2002 - 
 Without much notice, professional soccer has 
 contracted itself, lopping off the entire state of Florida, 
 one piece of which was just contending for the 
 championship of whatever the league is called these 
 days.This is as it should be. No congressmen 
 challenging commissioners, or lawsuits being 
 threatened, as in baseball. No midnight moves, as in 
 football. If a team can't survive, it should not only be 
 allowed to die but be given flowers. By my count, this 
 is the sixth or seventh life of professional soccer, the 
 stray cat of American sports. It depends on whether 
 you count the outdoor Earthquakes and the indoor 
 Earthquakes separately. 
 
 Major League Soccer is not to be confused with Minor 
 League Soccer, or Box Lacrosse, Team Tennis or Arena 
 Football. Theydo share the same cable.  This was the 
 promise that was made when the World Cup used our 
 stadiums and indoor plumbing several summers ago, 
 subsequently re-boosted by the women's World Cup 
 champions. Soccer would try again to convince us the 
 rest of the world is right and we are wrong.This seems 
 very important to the rest of the world, as if only our 
 affection can authenticate soccer, although I don't 
 think we have been as overbearing about basketball, 
 and look how our native game has taken off.
 
 I wish soccer well, as I have each time it has happened 
 among us. Soccer's current effort has been modest, 
 with the best players getting paid roughly the same as 
 a bullpen coach. There are no millionaires in American 
 soccer, unless you count the investors, who all made 
 their money some other way. As a baseball investor 
 once said, the way to become a millionaire in sports is 
 to start out as a billionaire.
 
 Soccer does have its own look. Hair seems to be as big 
 a thing in soccer as it is an invisible thing in the NBA, 
 the similarity being that neither uses a comb. Well, no 
 one has to shoot a basketball with his head, though I 
 wonder if Shaquille O'Neal has ever thought of trying 
 that from the free-throw line.
 
 
 Phil Woosnam, irretrievably Welsh and former 
 commissioner of the long-defunct North American 
 Soccer League, once defined soccer for the unsure. "If 
 it moves, kick it," Woosnam said. "If it doesn't move, 
 kick it until it does."There was another choice, an 
 American choice. Kick it until it goes away.The 
 incredible shrinking sport, now down to 10 teams, 
 started out on a field bigger than football, withdrew to 
 one smaller than hockey and might eventually be 
 reduced to something that can be folded into a box and 
 used to lobotomize siblings in the back seats of station 
 wagons on summer vacations. That would at least be 
 useful. Saying goodbye to a soccer team is as easy as 
 saying goodbye to sushi.
 
 I suppose we have a right to feel proud of ourselves, 
 having repeatedly survived the peril of soccer.Here is 
 my theory on why soccer continually fails here.It was 
 assumed that soccer would become the favored sport 
 of ethnic populations, and the tough grandchildren of 
 the Old World would become the next generation of 
 players and spectators.  That's the way football was 
 born. Basketball renews itself on similar and familiar 
 dreams.  Or soccer would become so organized, like 
 baseball, that sheer numbers would produce stars and 
 witnesses.What happened instead was that soccer 
 became the choice of suburban parents of children 
 without athletic gifts, the kind of kids who once would 
 have been kept indoors to practice the piano because 
 they were too klutzy to play baseball.  Because soccer 
 requires no real coordination to play, is fairly free of 
 danger and does provide exercise for growing bodies, it 
 became a kind of community calisthenics for the little 
 darlings of cautious mothers.
 
 
 Of course, none of these children has grown up to be a 
 great player or an interested spectator, leaving this 
 legacy of soccer in America: Not only have we not 
 become a nation of midfielders, but we have lost a lot 
 of piano players as well.
