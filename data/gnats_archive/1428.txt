 A followup on this critical bug: The same behavior has been
 observered in 1.3b2. Both grow to over 50MEGs of malloc'ed
 mem when using 1250 or so non-IP virtual hosts. After about
 that many, neither of them will even start up (even with all
 shell limits unlimited), failing with the error:
 "Ouch!  malloc failed in malloc_block()"
 
 As long as this problem remains, the promise of non-IP hosting
 will not be realized, and ISPs will remain shackled to having
 a small number of virtual domains per physical NIC/server.
 Steps should be taken to fix the problem, and to allow Apache
 to host a minimum of 10,000 non-IP domains.

 I suspect this is an issue with your config only and not a general
 problem.  For example, I just created a server with 2000 non-IP virtual
 hosts and it only consumes 4.5Mb RSS, 5.3Mb SZ.  Most of that is also
 shared between the servers... which works well on linux which has
 optimistic memory allocation; but probably chews swap which is never used
 on other operating systems (which use pessimistic allocation). 
 
 If you're duplicating configuration a lot rather than inheriting it from
 the main server then you're bound to chew a lot of memory, and there is
 absolutely nothing we can do about it.  Your vhosts should be extremely
 minimal, like this: 
 
 <VirtualHost a.b.c.d>
 ServerName foo.com
 ServerAlias *.foo.com
 ServerAdmin webmaster@foo.com
 DocumentRoot /www/docroot/foo.com
 </VirtualHost>

 Most of that memory is shared between processes on any reasonable OS, ie.
 you only have one copy of it.  Many systems, however, still expect you to
 have enough swap to allocate swap so that you would have enough if they
 were all different.

 Say you needed 2k of data structures for each virtual domain.  That is
 perfectly reasonable.  Then you will still need 20 megs per process for
 10000 non-IP virtual hosts.  You are likely using it in a very
 specialized application: you probably have nearly identical config
 settings for each vhost.  There is going to be overhead per virtual host.
 You would need to modify Apache specifically for your setup if you wanted
 to 
 
 A virtual server is just that: a virtual server, configurable nearly as
 much as the main server.  That takes overhead.  Hostnames aren't really
 good substitutions for directories.  
 
 You may be able to scrap all the vhosts, keep the hostnames, then use
 mod_rewrite to internally rewrite user.domain to domain/user or
 domain/~user or whatever.  Would have to think about that one.
 
 There are a few more things to be said about this WRT how copy on write is
 working in this situation, how it would be nice if it worked, and what
 Apache could do to work around it, but I don't have time right now.  I
 will comment more later.

 Something else I was going to mention: try with minimal modules,
 no frontpage hacks, etc.  A module can do whatever it feels like
 so you never know what bad things it will do...

 Yeah that's it then.  Do this:
 
 <VirtualHost _default_>
 ServerName www.hypermart.net
 ... yadda yadda, the rest of your www.hypermart.net config
 </VirtualHost>
 
 Er, well that might not exactly be what you want, if www.hypermart.net has
 the same ip as the non-ip hosts.  If that's the case, then with a 1.3
 server what you want is to put:
 
 <VirtualHost www.hypermart.net>
 ...
 </VirtualHost>
 
 as the *first* host on that IP.  With 1.2 you want it to be the *last*
 host on that IP. 
 
 Essentially you want to arrange it so that none of those 2500
 scriptaliases are inherited by the non-ip virtual hosts.
 
 Note you might also be able to use mod_rewrite to reduce the 2500
 scriptaliases down to a more manageable number.

 I created a www.hypermart.net virtual server to replace the main
 server, moved all the Scriptaliases there and now the processes
 are only taking up 5meg each! Fantastic!
 Thanks for your help!

 Why?  Note not redirect, but internally rewrite them before serving them.
 That means that to the client it still seems just like user.domain, only
 you don't actually need vhosts.
 
 May or may not be possible.  Mildly interesting, so I will take a look
 when I get a chance...

 I just tried a minimal version of 1.2.4 with no luck- it seems
 all of the memory usage is happening within some central part
 of the code.

 Well, I know a little C but am by no means good enough to modify
 the Apache source... I really don't see where all the mem is going
 though- we have very minimal virtual host definitions, just a
 server name, IP, document root, and a cgi-bin scriptalias. Seems
 like all that together would be less than 500 bytes?

 Well, would it be possible to create something like "lite" virtual
 hosts that could be a lot more memory efficient?

 Just to let you know I think we found the problem :-)
 It was about 1200 Scriptaliases in the main srm.conf getting
 inherited to each virtual server. With that fixed it is
 back down to about 5meg per server now.
