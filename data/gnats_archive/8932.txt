HPUX 10.20 - HP ANSI C compiler
HP-UX viola B.10.20 A 9000/715 2001559321 two-user license

The same problem exists with  HPUX 11 system as well also HP ANSI C compiler.
HP-UX edda B.11.00 C 9000/892 365130391 32-user license
>Description:
It appears that the configure script is faked into believing that a 
nonexistent stdint.h file exists on the HPUX system. It then builds
the presence of the stdint.h file into other headers. Which causes
compile failures.

running  a minimal configure (./configure) I get the following:

Output to the screen includes:
checking for INT64_C in stdint.h... yes

The file stdint.h does not exist in an HPUX ANSI C install !
I believe that the INT64_C is defined in inttypes.h 
Could it be that it is getting picked up from there ?

It is a problem because in the config.log I see the following:

configure:9629: cc -c -g -Ae +DAportable +Z -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED -D_REENTRANT -I/disc1/user1/garth/utils/httpd/httpd-2_0_28/srclib/apr/include -I/disc1/user1/garth/utils/httpd/httpd-2_0_28/srclib/apr/include conftest.c 1>&5
cpp: "apr.h", line 132: error 4036: Can't open include file 'stdint.h'.
configure: failed program was:


The problem is that the file httpd-2_0_28/srclib/apr/include/apr.h
contains:
#define APR_HAVE_STDINT_H        1

Which forces inclusion of the non-existant stdint.h file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to configure and build on an HPUX system with the HP ANSI C complier.
(I know I would not have it either !)
>Fix:
I tried to follow the configurator and got lost.
It appears to be related to the presence of a definition of INT64_C

This problem should be fixed in revision 1.421 of

This will be included in the next release of Apache 2.0.

Thanks for using Apache!
