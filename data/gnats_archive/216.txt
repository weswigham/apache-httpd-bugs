>Description:
I depend on the SERVER_NAME environment variable in CGI scripts, especially for
determining which domain a request came through on a multi-honed server.  The 
problem is it's not always set to the fully qualified host.domainname format.

If you could guarantee that SERVER_NAME is *always* set to the fully qualified 
host.domainname, regardless of the host specified in the URL, it would help a lot.
