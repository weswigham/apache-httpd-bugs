>Release:        2.0a4
>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux RedHat 6.1 etc. gcc version egcs-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
>Description:
The ap_config.h gile currently has a bug where the
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern "C"
    #endif
is not blanaced with a similarly conditionalized close brace. (I did not have this problem with 2.0a3 .)

Also, the header files use the identifier "new", mostly to delcare formal parameters in prototypes. "new" is a reserved word in C++ and hence this does not compile with a C++ compiler. This happens with both 2.0a3 and 2.0a4 but did not happen with 1.3.x versions.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile the following two one line programs with a C++ compiler:
    #include "ap_config.h"
and
    #include "httpd.h"
>Fix:
The ap_config.h problem is just a typo. Add an apropriate C++ bracket closer to the end of the file. The "new" identifier problem can be fixed easily by changing these to some other name. (There is no dependency on the name of a formal paramter from a header anywhere in the code.)

State-Changed-Why:

The problem was identified and the development tree has
been corrected on 19 June.  Look for this to be fixed with
the release of the next 2.0 alpha.

Thanks for supporting Apache 2.0 development and
participating in its Alpha!
