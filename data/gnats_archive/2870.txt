>Description:
[DISCLAIMER: this could be a side-effect of the MacOS X Server port, but I doubt it as the code concerned is http_config.c, which was not touched.]

When Apache with DSO modules is launched, it gets DSO modules, then call unload on them, then loads them again and adds them at this point to the modules list. Unfortunately, a module is only chained in the list if its next pointer is 0, but this pointer is not cleared when the module is unchained. So Apache complains the second time and doesn't chain the module back :-(

>How-To-Repeat:
Have a module be dynamically loaded. Start Apache, then stop it. In the log, there is a message about the module not being able to be removed.
>Fix:
Here it is.
