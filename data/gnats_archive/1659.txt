State-Changed-Why:
I can not reproduce this.  Are you running RedHat's
Apache that they provide, or a clean distribution downloaded
from http://www.apache.org/dist/ ?  If you are using a RedHat
modified one, please try an unmodified one.  Some people do
very strange things when making distributions.
