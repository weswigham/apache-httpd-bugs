Binary distribution of Apache httpd from apache.org
Intel NT 5 0 2195 Service Pack 2 
>Description:
The command "echo" changes & to &amp; in environment variables. So, i cannot write text such as "Vladimir&nbsp;Komarov" with "echo" command. Nevertheless, symbols such as &lt; &gt; &agrave; etc. are printed correctly.
>How-To-Repeat:
<!--#set var="wrong" value="Vladimir&nbsp;Komarov"-->
<!--#set var="right" value="Vladimir &lt; &gt; Komarov"-->
<!--#echo var="wrong"-->
<!--#echo var="right"-->

The result will be:

Vladimir&amp;nbsp;Komarov
Vladimit &lt; &gt; Komarov
>Fix:
Add "nbsp" to entlist array in function decodehtml()
