I installed apache about 1 week ago and al was working fine until i leep getting this message. I cannot connect to the server at all.
I re-installed linux from scratch and put apache on with mysql and php and once abaing the same error keeps on coming up.
I think it may have someting to do with how i have shut down the PC or someting.
