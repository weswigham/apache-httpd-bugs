Windows NT 4.01
>Description:
I tried to execute, as the Apache manual suggests the following command:
nmake /f Makefile.nt all install

output on the command line:
makefile.tmpl(143): fatal error U1001: syntax error: illegal character '_' in macro

The precompiled Makefile is not a C/C++ file and it is not possible to use it in a VC++ 6.0 environment, as the manual suggests.

State-Changed-Why:
Do not use the all directive.  Use simply installd or 
installr as your target (to build the debug or release
binaries.)
