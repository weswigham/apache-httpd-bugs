>Description:
I had some trouble with a cgi program ( written in C ). This cgi simply 
opens a binary file and writes its contents to stdout.
Unfortunateley all CR in the stream have been translated into CRLF.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply open a binary ( e.g. gif file ) and write the contents to stdout.
>Fix:
It's easy to workaround - do a setmode( _fileno(stdout), O_BINARY ) before
sending.
But why is this not the default setting for cgi-output?
I would never expect translated text (CR->CRLF) as a result of a cgi executable.
