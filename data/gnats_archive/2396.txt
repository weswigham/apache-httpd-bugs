>Description:
I support a system that has a globally diverse base.  Thus the internal time
zone of the SERVER (PDT) is not necessarily convient for a few of our customers
in Europe.  Their logs from the virtual site are stamped with PDT and
they are left to do the conversion.  

What I'd like to propose is the addition of a run-time directive allowable
in virtual hosts to basically change the local offset.  The form might
be just like the UNIX TZ variable.

Ex:

     TimeZone "PST8PDT"

Then rely on the underlying system calls to make the appropriate conversion.
Thus avoiding the problem with the Apache code having to do all the translations
and weirdies.

 You can't change locale and timezones efficiently on all unixes.  This is
 non-trivial to do portably.  There are other similar requests in the
 database in the suspended state. 
 
 However it's something that could be attempted as an extension to NSPR...
