>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 SP5 (binary version of Apache).
>Description:
The following configuration is used to deny access to a section of a website.

<Location "/~Brook.Schofield/JOURNAL/ARTICLES/">
 AllowOverride None
 Options None
 AuthType Basic
 AuthName "MY JOURNAL"
 AuthUserFile "D:\ Staff [NHM]\Brook Schofield\Private\auth.htpass
 require valid-user
</Location>

This works successfully but not if the URL is entered in a different case.
How is a case insensitive location added for Apache on Windows NT.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the above configuration on a Windows version of Apache and look at the URL's. Alternatively try the following

This URL requests HTTP Authentication:
  http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/~Brook.Schofield/JOURNAL/ARTICLES/

This URL does not:
  http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/~Brook.Schofield/JOURNAL/Articles/
