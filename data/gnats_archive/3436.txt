>Environment:
OpenStep 4.2 - Intel - cc
>Description:
I have declared a new type for files of extension .list
they are to be executed by /cgi-bin/sub_include

My usage is largely as follows within an HTML document
<!--#include virtual="/articles_links/template.list" --> <BR>

In srm.conf, I make the following declaration

AddHandler sub_includes-parse .list
Action sub_includes-parse /cgi-bin/sub_includes


This works without any complaint or error on 1.2.6.  However on 1.3.3 I get complaints of

handler "sub_include-parse" not found

for each file that has one of these includes.

It does execute /cgi-bin/sub_includes, but only includes some of the data that should be output, and then spews that error to the error log.

Returning to 1.2.6 fixes this problem
