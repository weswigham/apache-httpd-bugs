>Description:
Set-Cookies set in r->headers_out set by modules such as mod_usertrack are dropped if response is redirect. I'm unable to find anything that says its illegal to send a Set-Cookie along with a 302 response, but such documentation may exist.
>How-To-Repeat:
Example URL: http://www.divinia.com/redirect/1024/www.apache.org/

mod_usertrack cookies are enabled in httpd.conf, which are served when requesting a URL such as:

http://www.divinia.com/
>Fix:
If its not illegal to send Set-Cookies with 302's, special case them in main/http_protocol.c.  The following patch has worked for me:

 It turns out that the patch that I submitted with the PR works fine when
 there is only one Set-Cookie in r->headers_out.  This patch should fix it:

 aaron -
 
 i ran into the exact same problem in apache 1.3.3. did you ever find any
 other resolution to this? i also can find nowhere that states that setting
 cookies in a redirect should be illegal - but i can't find anything that
 states that definitively either. so i'm still unsure whether this is a bug
 or feature in apache.
 
 thanks -

 Someone else suggested putting Set-Cookies in err_headers_out, but it made
 less sense to me than doing what my patch does.  I also found it necessary
 to move the cookie setter to post-read request in my module.
 
 I cant seem to find anything that would indicate that Set-Cookie is
 illegal in non-2XX responses either, and it seems to be working correctly
 in my application with all the browsers I've tested.
 
 Aa.

State-Changed-Why:
As discussed on new-httpd, you should be setting
err_headers_out (which isn't really for errors; I think a
comment in the source even says that it is misnamed) if
you want it to be sent on a non-200..299 or 304 response.

I think that resolves this.
