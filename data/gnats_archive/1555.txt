>Description:
After upgrading to 1.2.4 we (from 1.0) began seeing excessive  ... "send body lost 
connection to: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : Broken pipe" messages in our error logs.

No apparent problems retrieving pages have been reported.  Is there a way i can 
retrieve the information as to which pages are involved in this problem as they 
are not logged.

All logged messages are not from slow connections. Numerous pings and 
traceroutes confirm most these sites to not be unreasonably slow (not 
greater than 500 ms) or unreliable connections (greater than 5% packet loss). 

This does not appear to fit the previous descriptions in the bug report list.
>How-To-Repeat:

The message logged in the error log with no indication of the page/file indicating the problem or reason for the broken pipe.

>Fix:
None at this time.  

Do i want keepalives set higher for this or do i want them off.  
I tried setting the values higher but this merely delays the output of the 
error message.  

I am now trying without any keepalives (keepalive off). This seems to have 
reduced the frequency of the errors

State-Changed-Why:
The messages do not indicate an error or a problem unless
you see _very_ much of those messages in your error log
(As far as I remember version 1.0 of Apache never
 reported such 'errors').

The messages are caused by clients breaking the
connection, by buggy clients (you will see those
messages when a client with broken PDF support tries
do download PDF files from your site, i.e. byte-serving)
and by clients accessing your site via an extremely
slow connection.

But how many of those messages do you see and how many hits
get your server?

 How much would be _very_ much?
 
 I checked a tape and it is in none of our 1.0 logs.

 If this is not an error it should not log an error.  This shoud be a
 configurable log message. Also the message probly could be changed to
 better indicate the source of the problem/message.  Our customers didn't
 appreciate it at first.
 
 Is it possible to turn logging of this particular message OFF?  This is
 akin to the logging of lame server delegation messages in named; at least
 to me it is since i cant do anything about it.
 
 >But how many of those messages do you see and how many hits
 >get your server? 
 
 Since you didn't specify an interval i hope this will do:
 two one hour samples 
 
    113163  successfull hits 
    3096   total errs
    1288   Broken pipe errors 41.6% of all errs, 1.1% of all hits
  
    97773  successfull hits 
    2627   total errs
    1077   Broken pipe errors 41.0% of all errs, 1.1% of all hits
 
 So i guest this "send body lost connection: site: broken pipe message is
 not significant.  
 
 On a similiar note some time ago i was taken aback by the large number of
 collisions on our ethernet port some time ago but it turns out that it was
 less than .01% of the total ethernet traffic.  Moral of the story is:
 numbers dont always indicate the maginitude of the situation or problem.

 Apache 1.0 did not generate such error log messages.

 Apache 1.3+ supports syslog-like loglevels. The broken pipe message is
 logged as a 'warning' and not as an error.
  
 >   Is it possible to turn logging of this particular message OFF?  
 
 No, you cannot turn if of for this particular message, but the
 verbosity of the error log can be defined on a per-server basis with the new
 (yet undocumented) LogLevel directive.
 If you use "LogLevel Error" only 'emerg', 'alert', 'crit' and 'error'
 messages are logged, but no 'warn', 'notice', 'info' or 'debug' messages.

 1% of all hits appears to be a normal value (in my opinion only >>5%
 may indicate a problem). If you haven't received any complaints from your
 visitors you can savely ignore the messages.

 One questions why we even generate the error message.  It just causes
 people to worry and submit PRs.
