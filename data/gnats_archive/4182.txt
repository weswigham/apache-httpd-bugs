>Release:        1.3.6
>Environment:
I have Alpha Server 800 and wanted to run the Web server.
I down loaded the entire files through the net.
>Description:
As soon as I type ./httpd to start the server, I get the problem

./httpd: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: cannot map libgcc.so

I can't find libgcc.so ANYWHERE in the machine, though I have a complete
gcc compiler. What's wrong?
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I do not know what's going on. Should compile locally? I downloaded the
executable version.

State-Changed-Why:

I just uploaded a new 1.3.6 binary distribution which
fixes the problem (my egcs compiler was configured to
dynamically include libgcc).

Make sure that you get the latest version if you download
the distribution:
