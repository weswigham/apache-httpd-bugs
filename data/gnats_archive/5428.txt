>Description:
It would be very nice if the source code release either contained a TAGS file
(preferably generated in etags format), or a shellscript that might indicate
how to create one.  Several of the source code files make use of macros
which make it very difficult to use etags to generate fully useful TAGS files.
For example, main/util_script.c contains declarations of the form:

   API_EXPORT(void) functionIdentifier(....)

where API_EXPORT is a macro that evaluates to "void" (I assume).  When etags
scans this line it sees API_EXPORT as the declared function, and not
functionIdentifier.
>How-To-Repeat:
API_EXPORT(void) ap_log_rerror(....)
>Fix:
Build the TAGS file with something like (all on one line):

etags --regex='/[A-Z_]*_EXPORT(\(.*\))[ \t]*\([A-Za-z_0-9]*\)
(/\1 \2/' ap/*.[ch] main/*.[ch] modules/proxy/*.[ch] modules/standard/*.[ch] mod
ules/experimental/*.[ch] support/*.[ch] os/unix/*.[ch] regex/*.[ch]
