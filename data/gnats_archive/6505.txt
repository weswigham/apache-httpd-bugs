Hi!

     I am new to the Apache world and need help.  If this is not the right place for me to discuss this problem, please point me to the correct place.  I need to find out "what is the best way to generate a system call log for Apache running under WindowsNT?".  In other words, I need to create a log file which logs all the system calls make by Apache server.  Any suggestions?


thanks,

Peggy Shen
