DG/UX 5.4R3.10 on Motorolla 88100 based AViiON
workstations and servers.
>Description:
Hi Folks,
        First, let me say, I think Apache is GREAT!  Bravo and Thank
You.
        I work for the United States Geological Survey.  We are using
the Apache Server at bunches of sites are are very pleased with the
speed, flexability and reliability of the server.  We are primarilly a
Unix house using DG/UX 5.4R3.10 on Motorolla 88100 based AViiON
workstations and servers.

        I have had one recurring problem with compiling Apache: if I
permit the default optimization level (-O2), the server consumes all
memory and all swap before a single useful function is performed.  I
cannot use -O1, either -- I have to eliminate optimization completely
(set "OPTIM=" in Configuration).  That's fine with me and I am not
complaining -- only passing on my experience.  I find it astounding
that y'all even have dgux as one of your known platforms:

% Configure
Using config file: Configuration
Using Makefile template file: Makefile.tmpl
 + configured for DG/UX 5.4 platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
%

Wow!
        Actually, I do not know if this problem still holds in 1.2b11.
Though I fetched and compiled 1.2b11 this morning, I didn't even
bother to try any optimization.  I just set "OPTIM=" in Configutation
and I'm running.

        So, again, Thank You on behalf of the USGS.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Jun  1 11:03:58 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
What version of gcc are you using?  This is probably
an interaction between gcc and the OS; if you aren't using
a recent version of gcc (2.7.2.x would probably be
best), upgrading gcc could fix the problem.

While we can automatically disable optimization for specific
platforms, this is likely to be more of an issue with your
setup and may well not apply in general to the platform.

State-Changed-Why:
User reports problem went away when they upgraded gcc,
so we will leave Apache using optimization.

 Folks,
 
 	THANK YOU.  I have retrieved a newer gcc:
 
 % gcc -v
 Reading specs from /home/b/wink/bin/lib/gcc-lib/m88k-dg-dgux5.4R3.10/2.7.2.2/specs
 gcc version 2.7.2.2
 % 
 
 Though I have implemented it for only my personal use, I was able to
 compile Apache 1.2b11 with -O2 and do not have the memory problems I
 had before.  With this as the impetus, I will now see about
 implementing gcc 2.7.7.2 nationally w/in the Geological Survey.
 
 	Thank you for your useful responses.  Thank you for a GREAT
 tool, Apache!
 
 			Dan
