>Environment:
Sun Solaris 2.6 with cc compiler
SunOS pi 5.6 Generic_105181-04 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5
>Description:
During compile I see the following warnings:

cc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DSOLARIS2=260 -DSTATUS -KPIC -DSHARED_CORE -DSHARED_CORE_DIR=\"/usr/local/libexec\" -KPIC -DSHARED_MODULE mod_include.c && mv mod_include.o mod_include.lo
cc: Warning: multiple use of -K option, previous one discarded.
"mod_include.c", line 1455: warning: end-of-loop code not reached
"mod_include.c", line 1579: warning: end-of-loop code not reached
ld -G -o mod_include.so mod_include.lo

mod_include is the only module that complains about the end-of-loop problem
all modules complain about the -K option
Compiling with DSO support for all modules

[pi][/tmp/apache_1.3.0/src] # ./httpd -l
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_so.c 
>How-To-Repeat:
edit the ./Configure script as described in the documentation for DSO support.
>Fix:
No.

State-Changed-By: rse
State-Changed-When: Tue Jul 21 03:26:43 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The problem with doubled CFLAGS for DSO is fixed
for Apache 1.3.2. The warning about end-of-loop
not reached in mod_include.c is a known and harmless
message under some non-GCC compilers. Thanks for
your report.
