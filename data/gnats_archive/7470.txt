>Description:
After installation of Apache 2.0.14, the httpd.conf file contains the line

Group #-1

Upon startup, Apache complains, it cannot resolve that gid. After changing that
line to "Group nobody", everything works fine.

Change "Group #-1" to "Group nobody"

State-Changed-Why:

Thanks for your report.  It is almost always necessary
to edit httpd.conf before running Apache httpd because
there are many differences between systems.  On some
systems Group #-1 works, while on others an explicit
existing group needs to be specified.

Thanks for using Apache!
