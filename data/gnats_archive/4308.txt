   The HTTP specifications say that it is legal to merge headers with
   duplicate names into one (separated by semicolon).  Some browsers

That should be "separated by comma".

Some special considerations may apply for cookie-related headers, but
since this sentence tries to represent the general HTTP rules mentioning
semicolon is wrong.

Change "semicolon" to "comma".
