http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/apply_to_1.2b6/multipart-byte.patch
>Description:
http://www.apache.org/dist/patches/apply_to_1.2b6/multipart-byte.patch
fixes the pdf inclusion for Netscape clients,
HOWEVER it does not solve the same problem for Micrsoft's Internet Explorer
closely related to PR 125 and PR 154
>How-To-Repeat:
MSIE 3.01 + PDF plugin + apache 1.2beta + any pdf file
the mentioned patch will solve the netscape problems,
not the MSIE problems
>Fix:
Is probably a client problem, as stated in the mentioned patch,
general deployment of 1.2 should need a patch either in
MSIE or in apache for MSIE also

State-Changed-Why:
We are aware of the problem and discussing a fix.  The
problem is that MSIE formulates its requests so that only
the user-agent can be used to figure out how to respond,
and that is is an ugly thing to do.  I don't think this is
settled yet, but it should be settled one way or another
before the next beta.
