I've tried everything i can think of, redid apache, installed a newer version of perl
and still no luck.  The only thing that gets me is that one script extremely similar
runs http://main.mtmar.com/cgi/upload_list_pic.cgi.  I even tried copying my code after
the headers are declared and saving it as digest.cgi and it still doesn't work.

 Well, what are the permissions on the script?  Is it world readable and
 executable?  Are all directories above and including the directory it is
 in world readable and executable?
 
 What does the error log say?
 
 When I try the above URL it gives me a 500, not a permission denied.
 
 Exactly what does the error log say?
 
 What do you get when you run it from the command line?
