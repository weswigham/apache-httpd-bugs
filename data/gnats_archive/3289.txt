I'm posting this anonymously cause I don't care to take credit for discovering
this weekness.  You can choose to close this bug out too without investigating
it like the last time I reported it.  Yall can either fix the bug before the
whole world knows about it, or wait till the whole world knows and then fix it.

And yes the last time the bug was submitted it had PLENTY of information on 
how to reproduce it.  So once again.... read the next section carefully.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Netscape 4.0 on a Windows NT 4.0 workstation connected to the internet by a 
modem (56K).  Load a web site with Netscape that is running off Apache.  Then 
hold down the CTRL-R (Reload) key (hold down the keyboard key, don't click 
toolbar button). Hold down the key for approximately one plus minute. Netscape 
will attempt to reload this page over and over and over again at an extremely 
high rate of speed.  Typically the send/recv lights both blink rapidly for a 
while... then the server stops responding completely.  It doesn't kill the 
machine because FTP and other TCP and UDP based protocols still function just 
fine on the server.  Depending on factors yet unknown (strength of the web 
server box, etc.) it may recover from this after a while or simply never recover  
at all.
>Fix:
Don't close out the bug before giving it a valid review.

 Hmm; when trying this from an NT box with a serial wire connected to it
 rather than a ethernetcard, it seems to me that it is the NT's stack which
 gets overwhelmed. I get a 'dead' server apperanve on NT, but the actual
 server still lives on. (Server is just Apache 1.2 on a x486 freebsd 2.1
 box). I cannot quite reproduce using the network card. My gues would be
 that due to latency, whatever, the handshake takes to long on the modem
 link, it needs bits of buffers kept, and finally fills some crucial
 buffer.
 
 Perhaps the poster could check if the server is really down; and/or if for
 example 'telnet' to that same machine also shows it as being down. And/or
 if a reboot of the NT stations makes the server seemingly 'unhang' after
 having seemingly 'hung' it.
 
 Needless to say, a good max # per time-period per host would be a good
 thing. Even if it was per child (otherwise you would have to hash through
 a scoreboard accumulative structure).

 Does Ctrl-Alt-T show the number of active connections maxed out in
 Netscape?  If you try to telnet to the server manually from the
 same box does it work?  If you exit and restart Netscape does it work?

 I am not going to play games with this person just because they refuse to
 give any contact info yet expect us to help them.  It takes 2 minutes to
 get an account at any one of dozens of free email services.

 But any other connect to that IP failes. As does a restart of netscape;
 only a reboot seems to solve it. While from another machine, apache
 apears as alive as ever. So either I cannot reproduce it properly
 or it really is an NT network stack issue. Shrug.
