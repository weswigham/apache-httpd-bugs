State-Changed-Why:
User reports that it even happens on 50k files and it happens
even when stop button isn't pressed.  I'm waiting for a response
to see if this is related to the IdentityCheck problem in 502.

State-Changed-Why:

I tested the URL given using Netscape 3.01.  The response
to the directory index was fast and fine. The first attempt
at retrieving the big file produced no response from the
the site (Netscape sat spinning with no data being downloaded).
I then tried the same URL using TELNET and got a fast and
fine response, though it would have been A LOT easier to
test this with a text file download.  I then tested again
with Netscape and the file downloaded fast and fine.

Since we haven't seen any problems like this on other
machines, the above leads me to believe that the problem is
due to resource constraints on the machine in question
(possibly a swapping problem) or the machine's network.

We need more information, like exact copies of the
lines from error_log that correspond to the timeouts and
a complete description of the configuration of modules
and the Timeout directive in httpd.conf.
