Redhat Linux 6.1, kernel 2.2.14-6.0.1smp, gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Preliminaries: this rewrite pattern worked on 1.3.11 but fails on
1.3.14.  It is NOT fixed by apache_1.3.14-fix.diff.  A temporary
workaround for me has been to simply use the mod_rewrite.{c,h} from
1.3.11 inside an otherwise normal 1.3.14 tree.

Briefly, the %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER} variable fails proper expansion in
(at least) the RewriteCond pattern context.  Based on logfiles, it
appears that it may be due to a parsing error that whacks off the
final "}" which leads to interpretation as a string rather than being
variable-expanded.  I suspect that this has to do with the new
"do_expand()" parsing rather than the old method (note that's a
suspicion, not a certainty).

If you look at the working trace below (the upper set), you can see
that initially the REMOTE_USER variable is empty prior to the
lookahead, therefore failing to trigger a rewrite because of the
RewriteCond.  Next, the the lookahead triggers, finds the variable's
value ("mailtest"), and the rewrite succeeds in inserting the value
into the URL.

In the non-working trace (the lower set), the initial check on the
RewriteCond succeeds when it shouldn't.  The RewriteCond pattern
appears to have its trailing "}" lost, leading to treatment of the
variable expression as a string to match.  Since the RewriteCond
succeeds, the rewrite occurs, filling in an empty string (generating
"//pab.na2").  That suggests that variable expansion at that point is
working (in contrast to the RewriteCond stage).  Weirdly, then the
lookahead goes ahead with what looks like a good variable name, but
fails to find the value.  The upshot is that the variable's proper
value never gets inserted into the URL.

Following are the data (trace lines have had IPs and dates trimmed).
The working trace is generated from a 1.3.14 tree with the 1.3.11
mod_rewrite substituted into it; the failing trace is straight 1.3.14.

 Aargh, you are right. Try the patch below.

 I ran a test tonight: Tony Finch's patch solves the problem. 
 
 Note that I ran it using mod_rewrite that has had both the "apache_1.3.14-fix.diff" patch and this patch applied.
 
 Chalk me up as another happy Apache customer...  Thanks!
