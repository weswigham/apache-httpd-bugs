>Description:
The method is not being interpreted correctly.  When I ask for 
'PUT' /foo.html http/1.0' it seems to ignore the method by always using 'GET'.
 However when the filename doesn't contain a period, it is used correctly.  For
example, I am able to retreive a document using 'GEE /index.html http/1.0'.
 When I try a 'PUT /foo http/1.0' it creates the file 'foo'.

 Yes, I do not have any access restrictions for testing purposes.
 The script used for put is from

 However it does not appear that the script is even getting invoked.

Comment-Added:

There is a significant error in your test cases.  The
HTTP-Version component *must* be upper-case; i.e.,
"HTTP/1.0" and not "http/1.0".

Why do you think that the script isn't getting invoked
when you've got an error message concerning it in the
error log?

Try using a corrected request-line and see if that changes
the behaviour at all.

 Are you sure that it isn't the script doing bogus things?  If you do
 "Script PUT /cgi-bin/printenv" instead (assuming printenv exists on your
 server), do you see the same behaviour?
 
 Are you sure that there isn't a difference in that some of the files exist
 and some don't?  You PUT /foo, then try /foo/bar.html.

 I Changed the script line to read 'Script PUT /cgi-bin/printenv'.
 I also verified that none of the files already exist.
 When testing, I also was sure to use a capitolized 'HTTP/1.0' this time.
 If anyone would like to experiment, you are welcome to telnet to the server on
 port 80.  The hostname is veger.ppp1.com
