>Organization:
>Environment:
binary release of Apache 1.3.19
binary release of PHP 4.0.5
Windows 98 SE
>Description:
The server seems to run fine. The problem arrises when I try to launch other applications such as a PHP editor or other various apps.

A few applications that will freeze up when Apache and PHP are running are: PHPEd by Soysal; ICQ's URL feature; First Class Email Client; 1st Page by Evrsoft.

I think this is also mentioned at the PHP bug report site.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have the binary install of Apache 1.3.19, PHP 4.0.5 and Windows 98 SE

Using any part of the URL messaging in ICQ will freeze up ICQ until Apache is stopped. (unless Apache is not running PHP)

The First class client will also not work unless Apache and PHP are stopped.
The client I use is from my school ( http://fred.mohawkc.on.ca )
http://www.firstclass.com/downloads/client.html

Trying to run a PHP editor found either at http://www.evrsoft.com/1stpage/
or http://www.soysal.com/PHPEd

This sounds like a very php specific error, please follow
the report you mentinoned on the php support site.

No other module users have reported such behavior.  Can
you reproduce after disabling php?
