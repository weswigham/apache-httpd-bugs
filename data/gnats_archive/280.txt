>Description:
accessing any gopher server returns the error message:
Method Not Implemented.

example: gopher://manuel.brad.ac.uk:70/00/.docuwork/.hbupdate/.TEXT

mod_proxy has been compiled in and Proxy ON directive has been
set in config file httpd.conf. 

The problem remains whether socks support is compiled in or not.

Thank you for your attention.
