Are you _sure_ you downloaded the base, unmodified
tarball and unpacked it properly?  Please try the whole
procedure again to be sure you didn't miss anything.

Do the Makefile.tmpl files that it is complaining about not
existing exist on disk?

  Marc, 
 This is what is in the TAR ball: Am I missing anything?

 I created with a mkdir command the os/unix, support and the regex 
 subdirectories. Should those directories and any files contained within 
 be in the tar ball?
 
 <Are you _sure_ you downloaded the base, unmodified>

 <procedure again to be sure you didn't miss anything.>
 I downloaded from www.apache.org/dist  apache_1.3.3.tar.Z  
 and I tried apache_1.3.3.tar.gz . For both, I uncompressed and 
 unpacked each tar file. Is that the correct procedure?
 <Do the Makefile.tmpl files that it is complaining about not>
 <existing exist on disk?>
 
 The Makefile.tmpl files do not exist on disk.
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks for your help.

 Erm... you are missing nearly the entire source tree.  Please verify the
 size of your tarball (should be ~2.7 megs).  Something very wrong is going
 on when you are downloading and/or unpacking this.
 
 Download a fresh copy from http://www.apache.org/dist/
 
 Try using gzip to uncompress if you aren't already and a different version
 of tar if you are using your OS's tar.
 
 This isn't a problem with Apache, but some local thing preventing you
 from correctly unarchiving the tarball.
