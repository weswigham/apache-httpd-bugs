>Description:
The customer called to report that their page counter wasn't working.
Testing showed that no cgi script anywhere was working.
Tracing showed that open() calls were failing with EMFILE (Too many open files)
Logs showed:
[Tue Sep 30 01:15:46 1997] access to /www/cgi-bin/counter failed for cirrus.imag
.net, reason: couldn't spawn child process
>How-To-Repeat:
Stuff 125 virtual servers, each with two log files, into your httpd.conf file.
Agitate gently.  Pour into a tall glass and quaff deeply.  And then try to call
a page counter.
>Fix:
Check for EMFILE and log a better error message, or find a way to reduce file
handle usage

 It'd be great if we could print an error in all cases, but the truth is we
 can't.  In fact sometimes we have no idea an error has occured because
 some library routine runs into the error and doesn't report it cleanly (or
 portably).  I looked at printing errors a long time ago.  (I thought this
 was explained somewhere ... maybe it's just in
 htdocs/manual/misc/descriptors.html which is probably worth reading too.) 
 
 Under Linux if you're comfortable with recompiling your kernel you can
 raise your descriptors to 1024 without seriously causing problems.  See
 <http://www.arctic.org/~dgaudet/patches/1024-descriptor.patch>.  That's
 for 2.0.x kernels.  2.1.x kernels a similar patch can be used, and they
 can go far higher than 1024. 
 
 You'll need to recompile apache after installing that kernel, and ensure
 you've got the right /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm symlinks
 before doing it.  (You probably do ... it's hard to get anything done with
 them wrong :)

 I read it, I understood it.  However...
 
 So 'getpwnam()' fails but doesn't return EMFILE.  Ok, fine.  Then it
 tries 'exec()' and returns, with some error code.  At this point httpd
 is about to return the error message 'Can't spawn child'.  Fine.
 
 Just before it returns *that* error message, have it try opening
 /dev/null once or twice, since if it is near enough the limit to fail
 on getpwnam or exec, it's near enough the limit to fail on open(),
 which *does* return a clean, portable error.  (Heck, if you can't open
 /dev/null, it doesn't matter *what* error code is returned, does it?)
 
 There, problem solved.  You'll be putting it into the next version of
 Apache, yes?  :-)
 
 (It'll *also* allow you to stop dealing with this frequently submitted bug
 report, which is worth gold right there!  :-)
 
 (And it'll save countless web admins headaches as they try and find
 the cause of the mysterious failure of all cgi-bins on the system
 simultaneously...)

 Ok, I'll try that too!  Thanks!

 The error is detected in the child, after the fork, at which time there is
 no clear communication channel back to the parent.  In fact it does log
 the errno from exec.  What you suggest is not portable if it masks another
 error from exec, and how are we to know, without reading all the man pages
 and trying it out everywhere, that some OS just happens to do things
 correctly?

 But the reason for this is almost always because they have far too may
 file descriptors open.  For which we have another solution:  don't open up
 an access log for each vhost.  In 1.3 you can feed a pipe reliably with
 your log, and the logger can split the log in real time.

 Sigh.  It all seemed so easy.

 Hmm... guess I should change from 1.2.4 to 1.3... :-)

 Yeah I wish it were easy ... maybe we'll revisit it in 2.0.

 Well ... you may want to wait a week or two for 1.3b1.  I would really
 like to have a reliable piped log tester ;)

 Well I tried to avoid the need for that in 1.2.1 ... by using
 fcntl(F_DUPFD) to move all the log file and socket descriptors above 15. 
 The code that does that should log (I don't think it does now) an error
 message when it can't ... 'cause that's when Apache does know you're
 probably close to trouble.  That'd make it only log once per reboot and
 impose no performance difficulties ... and probably be portable enough.
 
 Hmm.
