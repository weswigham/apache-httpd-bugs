Linux 2.2.12, no patches applied.  Apache verions 1.3.9 with Fastcgi 2.2.2
This happens on x86 and StrongARM architectures.  With 64, 128, or 256 meg of memory. 
>Description:
We are rnning a webserver, processing roughly 3.5 million requests per day.  We have it setup in a hardware failover enviornment using a Foundry Networks ServerIron.  Apache will stop responding to requests, so the ServerIron will pull it out of production, and switch to the failover.  However, http will never respond again, until I FORCE the iron to send it requests (then it will come back in about 30 seconds to a couple of minutes) OR I must killall httpd.  killing it with -HUP will NOT correct the problem.  
>How-To-Repeat:
We invite any people willing to look seriously at this problem, to mail us at lev@ztnet.com.  We will provide any needed information to determine if it is indeed an apache issue, and to see it resolved!  We are in the process of setting up a full load-balancing solution, however if apache fails to respond and is pulled out of the active server loop, even though the box is healthy, it will obviously not function correctly!
