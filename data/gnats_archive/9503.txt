     Environment:
     Apache Version : 1.3.20
     Operating System: Windows 2000 Server
     Using precompiled Apache of Win32.
 
 
 
  I am working on an implementation that will proxy an IBM Main Frame
  computer through an Apache reverse proxy server.
 
 
   The URI that I have is,
  https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxx/cics/cwba/dfhwbtta/euls
 
  Where I am running into problems is with a rewrite rule to pass through a
  reverse proxy.  The rewrite rule that I am using is
  RewriteRule / https://xxxxxxxxxxxx/cics/cwba/dfhwbtta/euls [P,L]
 
  If I leave off the [P,L] the RewriteRule acts as a redirect and a
 connection
  is made to the MainFrame.  But, if I try to pass it through the proxy, I
 get
  an error message ... HTTP Error 403 ... which is very generic but I have
  found that it could be a port problem or some other simple configuration
  issue.  On the proxy, I had to use an AllowCONNECT 3015 in order for it to
  pass through.  But - on the reverse proxy that seems to have no affect.
 The
  rewrite rule is working, as I can see in the log that it is passing it to
  the proxy.

  proxy:https://xxxxxxxx/cics/cwba/dfhwbtta/euls [OK]
 
  Do you have any idea what might be happening?  I also tried to go to
 another
  server that is just using port 80 and I get the same error.  I know that
 the
  proxy uses port 443 and one other port (newsport?)  and any other ports
 have
  to be defined.  I added port 80 for grins but that did not solve the
 problem
  either.
