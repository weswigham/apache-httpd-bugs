Dec Alpha running OSF1 T4.0 738.5
>Description:
When compiling using cc in a Dec Alpha running OSF1 T4.0 738.5, get the message:
cc -c   -O2 -DOSF1   mod_negotiation.c
cc: Warning: mod_negotiation.c, line 627: In this statement, the expression "*cp
++=((int)(((*(__lc_ctype->core.towlower))==0)?__lc_ctype->_lower[*cp]:(*(__lc_ct
ype->core.towlower))(...)))" modifies "cp", and fetches its value in a computati
on that is not used to produce the modified value without an intervening sequenc
e point.  This behavior is undefined.
        *cp++ = tolower(*cp);
--------^

I don't know yet whether this will cause any problems.

State-Changed-Why:
This could indeed cause problems. It will be fixed in the latest source tree (1.3b3-dev), as soon as I can commit the change.
