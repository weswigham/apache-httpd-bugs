>Description:
Apache compilaton aborts because "os.h" is not found in routine "ap_config.h".
On line 91 of ap_config.h the  "os.h" I think should be "../os/unix/os.h".
>How-To-Repeat:
following the instructions for compilation.
1. Run configure in apache_1.3.2 directory but no make.
2. Configure mod_perl and install
3. Configure php-3.0.4 to install in apache_1.3.2/src/modules/php3
4. cd to apache_1.3.2 and do
	./configure ...
	make
The error "os.h not found" occurs just after comiplation begin in
the perl subdirectory.

 Erm... you would kinda think that someone would have noticed if that was a
 problem, wouldn't you?

 Does it do the same thing if you don't use php?
 
 What is the exact compiler command executed before failure and the exact
 error message?
