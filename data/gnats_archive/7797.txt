>Environment:
Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5
Using binary distributive Of Apache (no compiler used)
ActivePerl 5.6.0 (build 620) used for executing CGI scripts
>Description:
When I tried to use digest authentification (with module mod_auth_digest)
on simple CGI script test.pl (which works good without digest authentification;
 see code below), I get the following error message:

Digest: uri mismatch - </cgi-bin/test.pl> does not match request-uri </cgi-bin/test.pl?query=view>

I think that the problem is in incorrect URI comparison algorithm in
mod_auth_digest.c. Maybe I'm wrong, but in my opinion such requests should work
fine, where is no access violation (the script is always the same, only
parameters are changing).
>How-To-Repeat:
test.pl
-------

#!d:/perl/bin/perl.exe
use strict;
use CGI ':standard';

import_names('p');
$p::query ||= 'start';

print header, start_html;

eval "&$p::query()";

sub start{
    print "<a href=test.pl?query=view>Test</a>";
}

sub view{
    print "OK";
}
