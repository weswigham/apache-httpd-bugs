cc: line 897: warning 5004: Uninitialized variable "s_len" in function "format_converter" (5004)
        cc -c   +O3 -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -DHPUX10   mod_rewrite.c
cc: "mod_rewrite.c", line 2972: warning 562: Redeclaration of "add_env_variable" with a different storage class specifier: "add_env_variable" will have internal linkage.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Apr  6 12:31:14 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The first warning seems to be a bogus warning, while the 
second is valid and has been fixed in revision 1.20 of
mod_rewrite.c, which will be available in the next beta.
Thanks.
