 Additional Information:
     The error message appears whenever the Apache service is restarted af=
 ter I
 make changes to the configuration file httpd.conf.
     And it recommends me to check the errors.log for more infomation, how=
 ever
 I can't get anything related in that file.
     Once I manually stop the service and delete the pid file then restart=
  my
 system afterwards, the error doesn't occur.
     But it's so weird, it comes again after I just do a restart of the se=
 rvice
 and make it opened until I restart my system. See what happens, I find th=
 e
 error logged again in the event viewer after I just logon.
     I tried many ways to find some tricks inside, but not helpful.
     BTW, the previuos Apache 1.3.14 I have ever installed seems has no si=
 milar
 issues.
 
 Regards,
 Mark

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:22:33 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

This sounds specific to:
1. additional modules you may be loading
2. the means by which you are 'restarting' the server

If the service isn't stopped first, you get this error,
and you would get the error if it took too long to stop,
and the service manager shut it down forcibly.

Of course you get this error if you never stop the first
instance of apache.  There should be two Apache.exe 
processes in your task manager (not 4), if you show the
column 'threads', you would see one has about 3 threads,
while the other has many, many more.  

Please try upgrading to 1.3.20, and report back if this
problem still occurs, including any modules you may be
adding with the LoadModule directive.
