Cheap ass Windows '95
>Description:
Causes email server to respond "Error flushing receive buffer", FTP server to
respond "(0) Not enough free buffers to create socket", and without the http
Apache daemon running, it appears fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try some things at my server, view pages, email me, check out my ftp site,
anything involving the net.
>Fix:
Convert it from a DOS based app to a true win32 app?

But so far this server prog. is better because the other servers, using windows
vxd's and dll's were my problem in the first place, crash after crash.  Apache
uses its own files which is great.  But it is 16 bit

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... it is not a "DOS based program".

There is a known file descriptor leak in 1.3b3.  Wait
for 1.3b5 binary to come out and try that.  We really don't
support running a server on Win95 because it really isn't
designed for a server platform and there are so many things
that can break.  Your problem may well not be related to
Apache at all, but it could simply be that Apache is
causing some other problem to become visible.
