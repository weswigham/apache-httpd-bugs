Configuring srm.conf to use ReadmeName and HeaderName does not work on Win32 version. Exact same configuration, Apache version, README and HEADER files on Linux (RedHat 5.1) work fine.

The HEADER file is not pre-pended to the directory listing, nor is the README file added to the bottom of the listing.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the bug report.
The culprit was a bug in ap_sub_req_lookup_file.
The fix was committed to CVS last night, and you'll be
able to get it in the next release of Apache, or
in the current CVS code tree.

Thanks for using Apache.
