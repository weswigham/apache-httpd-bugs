>Release:        1.3.2
>Environment:
We're mostly using apache on solaris 2.6 with a bit of 2.5.1 and FreeBSD 2.2.7
>Description:
This problem manifests itself in things like SSIs when you have turned off
UseCanonicalName (pr #2882). It probably also causes difficulties for
mod_rewrite.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a server with a bogus ServerName and UseCanonicalName off.
Create a CGI that prints $SERVER_NAME and an shtml document that includes
it. Compare the value of SERVER_NAME from the cgi directly with the
value via SSI.
>Fix:
add the line
    rnew->hostname       = r->hostname;
to sub_req_lookup_uri() and sub_req_lookup_file()
This fix is due to James Grinter <jrg@blodwen.demon.co.uk>.
