>Environment:
Ultrix 4.2, Solaris 2.5, gcc2.7.2
>Description:
The program "ImageLoad.java" below fails to load a GIF or JPEG image file
on the call

	java ImageLoad  http::<host>/<image-file>

if the <host> is running Apache 1.2b7, but it works if running Apache 1.1.3.

Errors look like protocol mistakes, saying the image is not a GIF or JPEG
file.

This problem was experienced on both Solaris and Ultrix running 1.2b7.
Both work fine running 1.1.3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
// ImageLoad.java

import java.net.URL;
import java.awt.*;

class ImageLoad extends Frame 
{
  private Image im;

  static String URL_name;
  
  static public void main(String args[]) 
  {
    URL_name = args[0];
    ImageLoad app = new ImageLoad();
    app.reshape(100, 100, 320, 430);
    app.show();
  }

  ImageLoad() 
  {
    super("Image Test");
    URL file = null;
    
    try {
      file = new URL( URL_name );
    }
    catch(Exception e) {
      System.out.println( e );
      System.exit(0);
    }
    
    im = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage( file );
  }
  
  public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.drawImage( im, 0, 0, this );
  }
}
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile and run the ImageLoad program given in the full description.
Try to load an image from server running Apache 1.1.3 vs. one running
Apache 1.2b7
>Fix:
No, I can't be certain it's not a Java problem, only that the Java program
given works for 1.1.3, but not for 1.2b

State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sat Mar 29 13:48:51 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This is a bug in the sun Java code.  It misinterprets the
"HTTP/1.1" string that's part of the server's response as a
declaration that the response is incompatible with HTTP/1.0,
which is not the case (and is required by the standards).
At any rate you can work around it by adding something
like this to your config:

BrowserMatch "^Java 1\.0\.2" force-response-1.0

I might have the User-Agent string wrong there...

Thanks for using Apache.
