>Description:
I'd like to be able to do the following:

<LocationMatch "!^/(foo|bar)">
# access, auth, etc rules here
</LocationMatch>

How else can you have a default set of rules for the entirety of a site except for a particular set of directories? 

As there appears to be no way to explicitly say in a subdirectory to ignore the parent's authentication rules completely (if the subdirectory wishes no authentication whatsoever), I'm at a loss for how else one could accomplish the goal without explicitly mentioning every file in and every subdirectory from the root.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try, given the current available pattern matching, to authenticate all directories of a site except for a given subset.
>Fix:
Expand the pattern matching engine to include a "not" character (such as the "!") so that one could say for all things BUT the following pattern do the following.
