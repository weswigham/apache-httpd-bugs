Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
Apache 1.3.3
Apache-JServ-19981116
>Description:
JServContext method getRealPath unconditionally returns null which makes it 
impossible to get the document root in the init routine.  In addition, the
behavior of JServContext's getRealPath is not consistent with JServConnection's
getRealPath.  At least JServConnection's getRealPath provides useful information.

I realize both versions of getRealPath have "FIXME" in them, however, the location
of the document root is very important to a servlet no matter how you get the
information.  (JServConnection uses Apache environment variable Document root).
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes,  call getRealPath from init using getServletContext and from a request.
>Fix:
Implement getRealPath in a single class that for now uses the apache environment
variable and later will use the appropriate ISAPI or NMAPI interfaces.

 Note:
     Servlet Specifcation 2.1 deprecates getRealPath in the ServletRequest
 class.
 
 getRealPath is the only method for mapping a virtual path to a real path.
 In order to implement
 the 2.1 specification, getRealPath needs to be implemented in the
 ServletContext class.
 
 The current structure of the JServContext class does not appear to have easy
 access to any property  or value to determine the Document Root.
 
 Just a FYI.
 
 John.
