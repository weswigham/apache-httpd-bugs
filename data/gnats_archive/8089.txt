>Environment:
SunOS laborix 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
>Description:
Files with the extension .ica (used to provide connection information to the Citrix ICA client) are not served with the proper MIME-type.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just try to serve any .ica-file with any out-of-the-box Apache-installation.
>Fix:
I solved it by adding

application/x-ica               ica

to the mime.types file.
I would be very pleased if this small adjustment could make it into the official distribution.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 29 13:27:52 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

In general, we only add officially registered
MIME types to the config file unless there
is a very compelling reason.  Otherwise, there
would be hundreds of obscure MIME types in there.

Thanks for using Apache!
