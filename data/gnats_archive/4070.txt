>Description:
There seems to be a difference in the way different Web servers deal with down loading GIFs.
In our case the two servers are WebStar and Apache.  Some GIFs which download and
display successfully from WebStar are having troubles when downloaded from Apache.
Have you ever heard of this?  Is there any reason?  Does WebStar do something
differently?  Do you have any idea what?

     Help appreciated.  Thank you.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, if you can't provide the information we ask for we can't
run around trying to get it from you.  There is a reason
we _ask_ that you give it.

First thing you need to do is upgrade to a current version of
Apache, and not use an ancient beta.  Second thing you need
to do is be a LOT more descriptive about what exactly
you are seeing, what clients you are seeing it with, if
there is anything in the error log, etc.
