>Description:
The default httpd.conf configuration reads
AddLanguage kr .kr

According to ISO 639-1 at http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn.html#kl
The 2-character code is "ko"

due to this discrepancy, apache is unable to recognize the correct locale and file is saved as filename.html.kr

>How-To-Repeat:
in default httpd.conf
AddLanguage kr .kr

>Fix:
Unless I am wrong, it can be fixed by changing all documentation that deals with character Encoding.
