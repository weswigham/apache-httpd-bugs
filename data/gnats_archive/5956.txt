>Description:
We were running scalability testing for a 3 tier java application, middle tier is using jserv 1.1, we were using automatic mode of jserv and only one VM was running, at some random time, we saw the following error in mod_jserv.log.

We raised the ulimit filedescriptor to 1024, and problem still happens.
Is that an known issue with that jserv cannot scale?
