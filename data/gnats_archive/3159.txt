Most of the browsers are indentified as some version of Netscape for Macintosh
PPC -- the odd Windows NT still pops up though.
Server IS NOT stuck and continues servicig requests as usual.
>How-To-Repeat:
Connecting with Netscape PPC to the Apache server.
>Fix:
No, and looks like that using BrowserMatch to "downgrade" Macintosh as a whole
doesn't help at all, e.g.:
   BrowserMatch "Macintosh" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
Doesn't improve things.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct  6 15:52:15 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
close_wait is a normal part of a connection.  It is normal for
such a state to stay around for several minutes after the
connection is closed.  The connection isn't actually open
any more and very few resources are used to deal with it, but
it is used to keep state to protect against old segments
that may still be floating around the network.

 Sorry, I read TIME_WAIT in your submission.  TIME_WAIT is normal.

 Hang on a sec.  You said they were in CLOSE_WAIT, but you netstat shows
 them in CLOSING.
 
 Can you clarify exactly what you mean and why you think it is a problem?

 Sorry, my fault.  I actually meant CLOSING.  It's my understanding
 that a CLOSING state is entered as a result of a simultaneous close,
 which Steven describes as "rare but still possible".
 
 I think this is a problem because the connections stay in the CLOSING
 state and their sockets are never released.  In addition, this happens
 only with different releases of Netscape for Macintosh PPC.
 
 
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Werther Pirani
