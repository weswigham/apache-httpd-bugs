>Description:
The apache FAQ is very helpful, but it has so much information that it
is a little intimidating as it stands (a bad thing for a document intended
for new users).  Some more organization would be very helpful.  The technical 
problems could be organized into catagories like 
"compiling", "URL manipulation", "CGI", "Error Messages", etc.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
If this has not been done due to a lack of time, I could volunteer to do
the reorganization.
