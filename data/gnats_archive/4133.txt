Ben,

	My deepest apologies for wasting your time.

I found the explanation regarding ServerType's in the online docs in the 
following manner:

goto file:/www/apache/htdocs/manual/index.html

click on Starting in the TOCs

takes one to: file:/www/apache/htdocs/manual/invoking.html

click on ServerType 

takes one to: file:/www/apache/htdocs/manual/mod/core.html#servertype

where there is a brief explanation on the differences between inetd and 
standalone.

	Once again, my sincere apologies,

		Philip
