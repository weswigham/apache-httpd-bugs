>Description:
There is an unexplainable delay when I use the method "Post" to submit a form
while on the machine where the web server is installed, i.e. localhost.  If I 
access the same form over a network connection to my machine it happens 
instantaneously, or as fast as the network connection allows.  Of if I change 
the form method to "Get" then there is no delay when accessing from localhost.

I am posting these forms to PHP scripts, so the problem could lie with PHP.  
But I have determined that it must be either Apache or PHP.  I would appreciate 
any insight anyone can give.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just make a simple html form on your own machine (running windows) that posts 
to a PHP script on the same server.  Then open an internet browser while on 
the same machine where your web server is running.  Type in 
http://localhost/yourformname.html and try to submit some information with 
the form to the PHP script.  It will work, but there is a longer than normal 
delay every time.  Now access your web server from another machine on a browser 
by typing in http://yourdomainname.com/yourformname.html and submitting some 
information to the PHP script.  There is no delay then.

It doesn't matter what the PHP script does with the submitted info, the delay 
still happens when browsing from the localhost.
>Fix:
The only way I have figured out is to use the method "Get" instead of "Post".
