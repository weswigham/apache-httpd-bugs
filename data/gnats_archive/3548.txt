>Release:        1.3.3
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6 (SunOS 5.6 Generic_105181-03)
gcc 2.8.1
apache_1.3.3 with only standard modules
>Description:
When upgrading from 1.3.0 to 1.3.3, I get a lot of [warm] message
 exactly as describe in PR2584.
Extract from httpd.conf
AddHandler cgi-wrapper .cgw
Action cgi-wrapper /cgi-bin/cgiwrap
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The warnings came from http_config.c line 513.
This line is between "Pass one Direct match" and "Pass two wildcard matches"
The action handler is call from content_type="*/*" during the pass two,
so all is ok excepted the warning message.
suggestion: move warning message AFTER pass two.
