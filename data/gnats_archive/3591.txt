>Description:
well as I am new to this whole thing of webservers, I am going on what I read.
So using the suggested notes on your site about security since everyone is so
worried about hacking that I am conscience of this fact, I used the Directory
Directive of Order deny,allow <next line> Deny from all for /.
I saved it, then ran apachectl start, got an error stating this is "mutual failure".
Well I am trying to see where I failed at this since I am going full blind and am
new or green to this whole thing.  So, rather than spending hours going through
your database I am cutting my time to 15 minutes by writing this report.

No.  I am hoping you would show me.

State-Changed-When: Sat Dec 26 23:31:21 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
I have no idea why you think this is the place to submit
basic configuration questions or why you think it makes
sense to waste developer time that could be better spent
doing actual development instead of spending a few minutes
yourself to try to figure out problems before giving up.  In
any case, more appropriate forums for basic user support
are clearly described before you submit a bug report.

Since you declined to include the actual exact text of
the error message you got we can not help you.

Please ask this in a forum more appropriate for user support
(ie. NOT the bugs database!) and include exact error messages.

 Whatever.

 Since the documentation like all other's I have encountered is incomplete and lots of
 guessing
 is needed, I thought I would ask a developer a legitimate problem.  Giving you a taste of
 your
 own medicine, I put all the problems in the text box.  Well I guess you see how your
 documentation
 is like now, eh?  If you can't figure it out, then what are you doing there?  Bonehead?
