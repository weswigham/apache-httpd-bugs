>Description:
A user reported a bug against mod_throttle claiming that mod_throttle failed to 
record the number of bytes sent when the request passed through mod_proxy.
Apon debugging and examination of the mod_proxy source, I found that
ap_proxy_send_fb() tracked and returned the number of bytes received/sent,
but that NO ONE made use of the return value to update the request_rec's
bytes_sent field.

Find enclosed a one line change to src/modules/proxy/proxy_util.c that updates
the request_rec.

By making the change in ap_proxy_send_fb(), http and ftp response from the
remote server or from the cache will all correctly update the request_rec
so that other modules can make use of this information in the logging phase.

      return total_bytes_rcvd;
  }
