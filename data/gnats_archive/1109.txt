shmctl: Invalid argument
httpd: Could not set segment #xxxx

#536 resolution suggested to try a different user other then nobody.  I did this
and it did not work.  Any ideas ?  
I am running the server on port 8080 if your interested.

It works just find under HPUX 10.10
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a user and start it up.
../src/httpd -f ../conf/httpd.conf
>Fix:
I will try to run it as root temporarily

State-Changed-Why:
First, you need to upgrade from 1.2b1.  It is ancient and we can't support it.
Use 1.2.4.

This may well be a kernel config issue.  Verify how your
kernel was built.  Check your kernel config file (default
/stand/system) to be sure it doesn't disable any
of the shmem things.  Check the config man page for
some short details.
