I use SuSE Linux 6.4 and Apache 1.3.12 which came bundled.
Have downloaded Oracle Intermedia WebAgent module for Apache and compiled - it compiles without any errors.
The webagent documentation says I should recompile Apache enabling the webagent module at compile time.
I have compiled it as a module without errors.
WebAgent docs say I should add the foll. line to httpd.conf :
<Location /intermedia>
SetHandler intermedia_handler
</Location>

I use apxs to compile this module - it compiled without any errors.
When I try to start the Apache server, it says:
Cannot load mod_oraordwsc.so into server: /usr/lib/apache/mod_oraordwsc.so undefined symbol intermedia_handler.

State-Changed-Why:
You will really need to take this issue up with Oracle.
We can't possibly know what is going on with third-party
modules.
Thanks for using Apache.
