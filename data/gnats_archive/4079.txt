Apache 1.3.4 with mod-perl-1.18
>Description:
Compiled and installed Apache 1.3.4. Installed mod-perl-1.18
per instructions on perl.apache.org. Works.

Only changed httpd.conf to add <Location /perl-status> directive.

Tried using .htaccess files that work with 1.2.4, and
it gets completely ignored.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put a .htaccess file in a directory and make sure it works.
>Fix:
Could the mod-perl be overrighting the mod-auth?

Comment-Added:
The default httpd.conf has "AllowOverride none" which disabled
.htaccess files.  Have you changed that yet?
