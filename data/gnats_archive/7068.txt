SunOS 5.7, newest gcc
>Description:
We are doing some proxying/load-balancing to several upstream servers which have different "ServerName"s.
When mod_dir issues a trailing slash redirect on a URI which corresponds to the name of a directory, it uses that "ServerName" in the "Location" http-header field. But the client does not know anything about our exotic DNS.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I suggest to modify the source of mod_dir according to the following output of "diff". What do you think? Is there a problem with a certain class of clients which do not find a redirection URL without protocol and hostname?

$ diff mod_dir.c_original mod_dir.c
136,137c136,137
<         ap_table_setn(r->headers_out, "Location",
<                   ap_construct_url(r->pool, ifile, r));

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Jan 14 22:53:01 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
As per the HTTP spec, all HTTP redirects _MUST_ contain a 
URL including a scheme and hostname.  It is not legal to just
spit out a relative URL.  And this is the wrong place to try
to fix this anyway, since there are lots of other places redirects
can be issued from.

You need to either set the ServerName to the public name or
change your setting of the UseCanonicalName directive.
