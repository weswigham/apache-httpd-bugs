>Environment:
Solaris 5.6, Sun JDK 1.1.6
>Description:
I have a servlet with an inner class, and a constructor associated with that class.

eg.

public class MyClass {

   private class Inner {
      public Inner() {
      }
   }
}

This runs fine from the command line. If I change the constructor to be private, then it still runs from the command line, but fails under JServ. I get a java.lang.IllegalAccessException when trying to access the constructor.
>How-To-Repeat:
No example URL, I'm afraid. I've just built a basic servlet to exhibit this behaviour. The error will appear in the JServ log.
>Fix:
Not that familiar with the class loader, I'm afraid....
