>Environment:
Slackware 3.0 
Linux Kernel 2.0.27
GCC 2.7.2
>Description:
After properly configuring the distribution, the make seems to go off without
a hitch until the final links are done.  There are symbols __inet_ntoa missing
among a couple that are missing.
>How-To-Repeat:
No problem on a Linux system.
>Fix:
The FIX I have found to correct this problem:
0. cd to the src directory

1. Edit conf.h and find the line

   #include <arpa/inet.h>

2. Comment this line out

3. Insert the following line:

    #include "inetx.h"

4. At the UNIX prompt, enter the following command:

   ln -s /usr/include/sys/arpa/inet.h inetx.h

5. Things now compile right.

I am wondering if this is some sort of bug in GCC 2.7.2?  As I have had the same
problem in compiling BIND 8.1 with the same resolution.

State-Changed-Why:
This problem is already listed several times in the 
bug database.  It is not an Apache problem, but a problem
with your Linux installation.  It is normally caused
by upgrading to BIND 8.1, which breaks some things.  Either
fixing the include files so they are correct or adding
-lbind to the EXTRA_CFLAGS line in Configuration.
