>Description:
Here is my web server's directory structure.

/home/httpd/ibbs               ; document root
/home/httpd/ibbs/script        ; .php3 files here
/home/httpd/ibbs/images        ; .gif, .jpg files here
/home/httpd/ibbs/fileupload    ; uploaded files are stored here

I want to restrict somebody not to execute any CGI/PHP3 files
in the "fileupload" directory.

So, I have modified httpd.conf as follows;

---------------------------------------------------------

# iBBS Linux
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.32>
    ServerAdmin kiss@ism.co.kr
    DocumentRoot /home/httpd/ibbs
    ServerName ibbsl
    ErrorLog logs/ibbsl-error_log
    CustomLog logs/ibbsl-access_log common
</VirtualHost>

<Directory "/home/httpd/ibbs">
    Options FollowSymLinks Includes
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<Directory "/home/httpd/ibbs/fileupload">
    Options -Indexes -ExecCGI
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

---------------------------------------------------------

But test.php3 in the "fileupload" directory is always executed.
Of course I didn't forgot restarting the httpd daemon.
(I am not a novice in apache web server.)

I think -ExecCGI option is not working in my environment.
This problem is concerned to security.
