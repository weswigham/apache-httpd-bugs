State-Changed-Why:
If you search the bug database you will see this problem is well know. It is due to a bug in the compiler, not Apache. You should update your compiler with the latest fixes, try http://service.software.ibm.com/support/rs6000 or call service if you don't have them. PR 2312 lists the PTF's required but you should check that this list is valid for the level of compiler you are running.
