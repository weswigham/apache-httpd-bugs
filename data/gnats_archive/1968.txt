I was following the directions for installing server and when I reach to a point 
where it says type "make" . , it couldn't find it. It also did not create any httpd*
file. Therefore I am kind of stuck here.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... in order to compile Apache, you need a compiler
and associated utilities.  make is part of that.  If you
don't have a compiler you obviously can't compile Apache.
On Solaris you can normally find a make in /usr/ccs/bin/
but if you don't have a compiler (either Sun's $$$ compiler
or gcc) then it won't work anyway.  

This isn't a problem with Apache.

 It should have either given you a httpd file or given you an error.
 
 If you send the last couple of dozen lines of the compile attempt I should
 be able to suggest something, but don't really have the time to pursue it
 too far since it isn't an Apache problem.
