All
>Description:
When using the APACI's "BinaryDistribution" layout, and/or
binbuild.sh, to build Apache, an "install-bindist.sh" script is
generated, which can be used to fix various files (e.g. apachectl
and httpd.conf) so they will fit the correct directories.
Unfortunately, apxs is not touched, although it had to (its contents
are incorrect for BinaryDistribution layout).

The attached patch resolves this problem. I am not an APACI's expert
so please review it before adopting it. Maybe there is a better way
to do it. In addition, I believe that there are more files which are
not touched by binbuild.sh (i.e. install-bindist.sh) but should be.

The attached diff refers to the 1.3.6 source tree, not to the up-to-
date CVS version. Note: Both of the "[  ]" there, mean "[ \t]" (i.e.
blank or tab), and not a string of blanks. Sorry for the long lines!
>How-To-Repeat:
Just build Apache using binbuild.sh, and then try to install it under
another system in a non-standard directory (this is what binbuild.sh is
for...), and then try to use apxs.
