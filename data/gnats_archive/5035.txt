Sun Solaris 5.6 , Compiler GNU GCC2.8.1 , 
>Description:
It is a web based project, where we are using Cold Fusion Web development tool
& Application Server on Sun Solaris 5.6 platform with Apache 1.3.3 as Web Server.

I have an urgent problem for which solution is required so i have
taken the freedom to ask you.

After installing Cold Fusion Application Server, we have to
configure Apache again to enable the DSO module_so and then
follow steps to LoadModule mod_coldfusion.so to the httpd.conf

To enable the Dynamic Shared Object(DSO) module_so ,

we have to execute the following command at the prompt :

$ env LIBS=/usr/lib/libC.so.5 CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --enable-module=so

(Instead of just ./configure, we have to use the env ... coz we
are using gcc compiler, also the $PATH is /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/GCC281/bin)

The configuration executes fine 
ls1-cw# env LIBS=/usr/lib/libC.so.5 CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --enable-module=so 

Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.3

 + configured for Solaris 260 platform

 + setting C compiler to gcc

 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E

 + checking for system header files
 
+ adding selected modules
 
+ using -ldl for vendor DSO support
 
+ doing sanity check on compiler and options

BUT WHILE BUILDING WITH THE "make" OPTION IT FAILS AND GIVES
an output , listed below ,which i am not able to interpret .

Your kind help in this regard will be greatly appreciated.
We had no problem configuring the Apache Web Server 1.3.6 on
other Sun Solaris, but unfortunately we had to return the machine.

State-Changed-Why:
First of all, Apache 1.3.3 is not a current version of Apache.
As with any problem, you should always try with a current
version of Apache first.

The error messages you are getting quite clearly indicate
something is wrong with your gcc installation, as you should
suspect if it worked fine on a different Solaris box.
If your compiler says it can't find basic include files
like sys/types.h, then there isn't anything much Apache can
do about it...
