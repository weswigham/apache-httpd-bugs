Hi guys,

Firstly, Apache is the most impressive piece of free software available, good work!
Anyway, my question is this. Do you plan to support Keep-Alive for proxied connections,
i.e. ones from the proxy to the server? Currently (in 1.2.5 at least) this is not
implemented, and I don't see it in the 1.3b3 CHANGES file.

State-Changed-From-To: open-suspended
State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Sat Jan 31 13:48:20 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:

mod_proxy needs a complete rewrite to be HTTP/1.1 compliant
(including support for persistant connections),
but this won't happen until version 2.0 is out... maybe later.

Thanks for using Apache.
