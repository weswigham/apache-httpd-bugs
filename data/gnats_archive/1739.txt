>Description:
permanent_pool (defined in src/main/Alloc.c) is not exported from
ApacheCore.dll. Some modules (for instance JavaSoft's mod_servlet) need to
access this variable.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile any module which uses permanent_pool.
>Fix:
diff -w -r apache_1.3b3/src/main/Alloc.c apache_1.3b3.new/src/main/Alloc.c

 Uh, no, modules should not be accessing those globals.  You're passed a
 pool as part of the module init() function which has the lifetime of a
 reset.  You're supposed to use that pool.

 Right. I'll patch JavaSoft's module to work accordingly.
 
 Thanks for the tip.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks if you have a problem using the pool passed to init()
feel free to bug us.  But since it is essentially the same
as permanent_pool I don't expect there to be a problem :)
