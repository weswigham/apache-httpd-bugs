Hi

I wrote a Apache initialization handler which initializes a bunch of data
structures and calls pthread_create() in an attempt to spawn threads.  I see
that the pthread_create () hangs.  I have seen this happen only on linux, both
RH 6.2 and RH 7.1.  With apache on Solaris 7 everything is ok.

Is this a known problem ? I searched all over and even posted to the infosystems* newsgroup but to no avail.  I really would appreciate it if you
could provide any suggestions ?

thanX

 I did some more digging on this one and found that
 pthread_create() is in sigsuspend() waiting for a
 signal (SIG number 32) that never arrives.
 
 Either the pthread manager never sent it OR it was
 blocked ????
 
 How does apache deal with SIG number 32 ?
