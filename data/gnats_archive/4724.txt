>Description:
File: os/unix/os.c
Code: ap_os_dso_sym
Fails to resolve symbols from a shared object because
shl_findsym behaviour is different in 9.x (well, at least 9.00) than in 10.xxx
In 9.x, needs to add manually the leading underscore to lookup symbols in
a .so object. I've checked it in 9.x and 10.x, and the latter does not need
the underscore.
>How-To-Repeat:
Always occurs in 9.x
>Fix:
Make the code for Raphsody more general, something like SO_SYMS_NEED_UNDERSCORE,
done before using dlsym or shl_findsym or NSLookupAndBindSymbol.
Note: why to malloc the new string (its slooow) ? Use a fixed str[MAXPATHLEN],
or alloca()'te it.
