Difficulty finding standard or registered MIME types
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.apache.org/library/index.html
>Fix:
When looking for info on standard or registered MIME types,
I came across the page http://www.apache.org/library/index.html

After surfing from there, I found
http://www.isi.edu/div7/iana/
and
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/
with registered media or MIME types.

You might want to add a link to this under the
Protocol Specs and Related Info/Related Stuff section.
