Dean,

I have successfully compile the server on my Sequent, and have a
running server.  In order to get it to compile, I added the following lines to
the Configure script: (note: "starpas" is the machine's internal name)

    *-*-starpas*)
        OS='Sequent Dynix/ptx'
        CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -D_SEQUENT_"
        LIBS="$LIBS -lsocket -linet -lnsl -lseq"
        DEF_WANTHSREGEX=yes
        ;;

and these lines to the conf.h file:

  #elif defined(SEQUENT) || defined(_SEQUENT_)
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/uio.h>
  #include <netinet/in.h>
  #include <arpa/inet.h>
  #define NO_KILLPG
  #define NEED_STRCASECMP
  #define NEED_STRNCASECMP
  #define HAVE_MMAP
  #define HAVE_SHMGET
  #define HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H
  #define JMP_BUF sigjmp_buf

Now I have one last problem.  When I attempt to access the server
through my Netscape browser I get a message the the connection was
refused by the server, and that the "server may not be accepting
connections or may be busy".  I have worked for two days on various
combinations in the httpd.conf and access.conf files.  I think the problem
lies in my system's etc/services and-or etc/protocol files.  Are there any
docs on the Apache Web Page that outline modifying those files?  If there
are, I can't find them.

Jeff
