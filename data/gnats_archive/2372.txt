+ doing sanity check on compiler and options
ld: warning: libc.so.6, needed by /usr/lib/libcrypt.so, may conflict with libc.so.5

The Linux test for detecting -lcrypt is too aggressive.  I have all
compiler options set to values which worked for building against libc5
on a libc6 system (it worked in 1.2.6), except that -lcrypt gets
detected (it's there) even when I try to make a libc5 binary.

Attempt to build apache on a Linux system with both libc5 and libc6
installed and attempt to build against libc5.

Libc6 is not ready for prime time, I'd suggest forcing the installer
to put -lcrypt in one of the Configuration flags.

 Actually, no, I'd be more tempted to say that if your compiler can find a
 libcrypt which doesn't work with the settings you gave, then that's a
 problem with the settings you gave.  There's nothing we can do to work
 around broken compiler settings...

 I would have agreed with you three months ago.  But redhat's 2.0.7-13 has
 been just fine to me...
 
 We won't remove the libcrypt autodetection.  It's a FAQ for folks building
 1.2 on redhat, it wastes our time dealing with people who don't add
 -lcrypt.  This is a transitional period, yeah it hurts.  Six months from
 now we'd be flogging a dead horse by still requiring folks to add -lcrypt.

 My compiler settings were not broken though.  After I hand-edited all
 the Makefiles to remove the spurious -lcrypt's which Configure added, it
 built (and ran) correctly under libc5.
 
 Oh, well.  Do what you will.

 Yes, your compiler settings are wrong if adding -lcrypt to them causes
 them to load a crypt library that doesn't work. 
 
 The correct way to do what you're doing is to create a new gcc specs file
 which does not have /usr/lib in it at all.  It should have
 /usr/i486-unknown-linux/lib in it only (or wherever you put your libc5). 
 It should also avoid /usr/include entirely... otherwise you could end up
 with a header mismatch -- and the result would be far worse than using
 glibc2 in the first place.
 
 To be honest, I've never been happy with a system with both glibc2 and
 lib5.  Believe me, I've tried.  I support apache on both platforms, and
 I'd love to have them both on the same system to simplify development and
 testing.  But there are just too many little problems that happen that I
 gave up on it... after wasting a lot of time with specs files, and
 rebuilding libraries and crap like that. 
 
 You, me, and probably 20 other people use this configuration.  There are
 thousands that use libc5-only, and thousands more that use glibc2-only.  I
 have no motivation to support a tiny fraction of the population using an
 interim solution.

 You're right.  It took me three months to figure out how to do it, but 
 with the right gcc specs and ldscript file Apache-1.3.1 configures
 correctly for both libc5 and libc6 on a mixed Linux system.

 Oh well.  It works with the right magic without any Apache changes,
 and if someone else happens to wish a similar solution, feel free to
 point them my direction.
