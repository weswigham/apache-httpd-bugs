RedHat Linux 7.0 2.4.4 #1 Sun Apr 29 12:44:27 EDT 2001 i686
Running PHP4 & MySQL 3.23.  
>Description:
I have a Linksys 8-Port Router/Switch with internal IPs.  When I access large pages from my server (also on same LAN) it starts to load the page, but then freezes.  ALL PCs on the LAN cease to access the internet (only a reset of the router will fix it).  Some pages work however (ones with small amounts of data travelling).  I can see the server attempting to send the pages via the internet, but to no avail.
>How-To-Repeat:
Cannot be repeated by the outside world.  Only happens within LAN.  Both IE and Netscape have the same problem.
>Fix:
Nope.  You tell me.

State-Changed-Why:

This sounds very much like a networking problem 
unrelated to the webserver.  Unfortunately, we
can't provide any help with that.

Thanks for using Apache!
