>Description:
I encountered this problem when trying to build the Jakarta Tomcat module mod_jk.so.  Analysing the Tomcat newsgroups showed that several other people were having the same problem, but no solution was posted.

I traced the problem back to an incomplete substitution within bin/apxs.  When I applied the following diff, I was able to build the module:

garlic.wlipa% diff apxs apxs-orig
74,76c74,76
< my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = q( -fPIC -DSHARED_MODULE);      # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
< my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = q(ld);          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
< my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q( -G); # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 
---
> my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = q();      # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
> my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = q();          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
> my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q(); # substituted via Makefile.tmpl

The problem apparently is that when I did a plain vanilla Apache install on this system, that it substituted these variables for blank, whereas they should be given proper definitions (and indeed are given the correct definition in other places such as src/modules/standard/makefile).
>How-To-Repeat:
On Solaris 2.6, do a plain vanilla Apache 1.3.14 install:
./configure --prefix=/home/www/apache --enable=module=most --enable-shared=max

Examine bin/apxs.  You will see:
my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = q();      # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = q();          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q(); # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 
my $CFG_LIBS_SHLIB    = q();        # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 

The blank definitions will prevent apxs from compiling shared modules.
>Fix:
I think that the configuration system needs to be extended to do the proper substitution for CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB, CFG_LD_SHLIB, and CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB within the apxs script.
