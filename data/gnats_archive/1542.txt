 Can you give me a specific value for __GLIBC__ or __GNU_LIBRARY__ that I
 can test against?
 
 I'd prefer to just use a test like:
 
 #if !defined(__GLIBC__) || __GLIBC__ < 2
 typedef int rlim_t;
 #endif
 
 I suspect that is the exact test I need... but if you could ask around the
 rest of the debian folks on non sparc systems for me that'd be great.
 
 Thanks
 Dean

 Turns out that rlim_t is defined in the sys/resource.h of glibc 2.1,
 but not the current glibc 2.0.  The sparc architecture currently has
 no choice but to run the experimental glibc snapshot as a production
 lib.  :-(
 
 #if !defined(__GLIBC__) || __GLIBC_MINOR__ < 1
 typedef int rlim_t;
 #endif
 
 Or both tests could be for __GLIBC_MINOR__, if that hasn't always been
 defined.

 How about this:
 
 #if !defined(__GLIBC__) || __GLIBC__ < 2 || (__GLIBC__ == 2 && __GLIBC_MINOR__ < 1)
 typedef int rlim_t;
 #endif
 
 I'd be happy putting that in.

 Fine by me.  Apache/Sparclinux forever.
