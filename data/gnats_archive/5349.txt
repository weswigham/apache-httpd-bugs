>Environment:
HP-UX 11.00, PA-RISC 2.0, gcc 2.95.2
>Description:
When compiling Apache with gcc on HPUX 11 and the options 

  ./configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max

for APXS (dynamical loadable modules) it causes a compilation error. 
This is due to a missing preprocessor instruction in src/os/unix/os.c. 
The line should be

  #if defined(HPUX) || defined(HPUX10) || defined(HPUX11)

It compiles without errors now. So far so good. This only for
information.



But when compiling the PHP3-Module with the option

  ./configure --with-apxs=<path-to-apache>/bin/apxs

There appears this error:

ld -b -o libphp3.so ./mod_php3.o libmodphp3-so.a -L/usr/local/lib
-L/opt/gnu/lib -lgdbm -lgdbm pcrelib/libpcre.a -lpam -lm -lnsl -Lpcrelib
-lpcre -L/opt/gnu/lib 
ld: DP relative code in file libmodphp3-so.a(maketables.o) - shared library
must be position
    independent.  Use +z or +Z to recompile.
apxs:Break: Command failed with rc=65536
make: *** [libphp3.so] Error 1


OK, I already replaced the +z option in the Makefile with -fpic 
for the GNU gcc and Apache has compiled with the option  -fpic, too.
Apache+APXS+PHP3 compile under RedHat Linux 6.0 without complaints.

Thanks in advance for any hints.
