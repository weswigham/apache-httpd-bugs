>Description:
I am using the RewriteRule in proxy mode [P] and find that I am correctly passed
onto the site-hided page but cannot see the image files that come with that page.

There are no problems with this when I use the RewriteRule in [R] mode.
>How-To-Repeat:
If you go to http://violetta4.mcis.washington.edu you are (secretly) passed onto a machine
called violetta2.mcis.washington.edu.  There is an image that is not being displayed.
>Fix:
I could perhaps fix this by putting absolute paths in all of my gifs but find
that much to cumbersome

 Erm... violetta4.mcis.washington.edu isn't in the DNS.

 Sorry about that.  I forgot that we are kind of running a
 security-by-obscurity system here at the medical centers.  We have a
 hidden DNS server.  The IP address that you can use instead is
 204.203.141.20.  This takes you to violetta4.mcis.washington.edu...

 Exactly what rewrite rule are you using?
 
 Any access to any URL I tried on 204.203.141.20 gets the same HTML file
 back.

 Hopefuly seeing my config file will help you understand what I am trying

 I don't understand this ^^^.  I think it's that Rewrite rule is not
 prepending the forwarded URL onto the relative URL of the image that is
 given in the http source of the html file.

State-Changed-Why:
I cannot access your website , neither through the Name
nor the IP-address. But your problem is not a mod_rewrite
problem. That all works fine for the [R] situation instead
of the [P] situation is clear: A redirect pushes the
browser directly to the hidden server and then no more
proxying is done which can go wrong. For the [P] case
your problem is your random-script. You pass all URLs
through it. I don't know what it does but it has to
read /whatever URLs and output http://randomhost/whatever
URLs. I think it forgets the /whatever part to
append to the output URLs. Please check your radnom
script and make sure the rewriting is done you want
it via the RewriteLog directive. I'm sure your problem
is a problem inside your RewriteMap problem (the random
script). If not, please give us more details about the
script and information where we can try it out again.
