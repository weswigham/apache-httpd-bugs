>Description:
We have been running this webserver for aprox 6 month now and from the beginning of this week this strange thing has begun to appear. The webserver hosting aprox 100 domains stops showing html pages, doing a ps -aux or top indicates that the apache daemon is still running actually everything is running. There are no indications in any logfiles whatsoever on this insident. Hupping the Apache deamon solves the problem temporary. What really gives me gray hair is that it happens randomly like 6 times a day. Checking logs reveal that no user where online neither any strange behaviours or heavy traffic etc. Any Ideas plz ?
