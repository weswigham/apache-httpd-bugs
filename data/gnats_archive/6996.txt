>Organization:
>Environment:
RedHat Linux 2.2.16-3, with Apache 1.3.3
>Description:
"Apache suEXEC Support" documentation has, in part, the constraints:
 14.Is the directory NOT writable by anyone else?
 16.Is the target program NOT writable by anyone else?
which can produce the suexec log errors "directory is writable by others:" and "file is writable by others:" if violated.

These constraints disallow any kind of group CGI program development, in particular, within the configured virtual host ScriptAlias directory for the cgi-bin directory, unless by forcing all developers to log in as the same user, which is not a good solution.  Simply disabling these constraints globally may also not be the most desirable solution.

Can we have some configuration option which will allow selective CGI program execution for programs with group write permission on the file and cgi-bin directory?  With properly configured groups, disallowing execution of files with group write permissions may be convenient at times but is no more secure than execution of files with user write permissions, and suexec should not presume incompetence of the part of the administrator.  Arguing about this issue with customers is also not a useful solution.
>How-To-Repeat:
standard suexec configuration
>Fix:
How about a "GroupExec yes" directive?  Or, maybe better, a "groupexec" keyword for the Group directive?  As a quick hack, group write permission checking can be disabled in suexec, but the point is to avoid that.

State-Changed-Why:

I understand your desire for more flexibility here.
However, you need to understand that suexec is
specifically designed to be extremely simple and very
inflexible.  Any other design would multiply possible
sources of security problems in an already dangerous
type of program.

You may like to look into other ways of running
suid CGI scripts (eg. cgiwrap).  Alternatively,
if you understand all the consequences, you can
always modify the source code to do what you want.

Adding a configuration directive to do this would
lead people who don't understand the consequences
to be more likely to hurt themselves.  In addition,
it is fundementally very difficult or impossible
to safely pass configuration information from 
Apache to suexec.

Thanks for using Apache.
