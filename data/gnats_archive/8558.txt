>Environment:
Patched up-to-date RedHat 7.1 system, with their build of Apache (their 1.3.19-5)
>Description:
With an /etc/hosts containing just
  127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomainany attempt to start apache gives a SEGV (before opening log files)

Appending the output of `hostname` to that line fixes the problem.
(Problem appeared with a mass server rollout where /etc/hosts was a common file so couldn't contain individual hostname.)
>How-To-Repeat:
Take a working server, rename /etc/hosts out of the way, and try and restart it.
