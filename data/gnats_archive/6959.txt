This is perl, version 5.005_03 built for i386-linux
>Description:
When configuring a named virtual host, the User directive must be specified before the VirtualHost directive, or a User directive must be included within the VirtualHost directive.  I was configuring a virtual named virtual host.  The host served web pages fine, but had a problem when executing a perl cgi script.  The error messages below is what was generated in the ScriptLog.  

%stderr
[Mon Dec 11 21:47:12 2000] [error] [client 192.168.1.2] (2)No such file or directory: getpwuid: invalid userid -1
[Mon Dec 11 21:47:12 2000] [error] (2)No such file or directory: exec of /home/httpd/jec/dev/cgi-bin/test.pl failed

The getpwuid error seemed to indicate that it couldn't find the user name in the /etc/passwd file.  I'm assuming it was trying to use a null user name to run the CGI program.  Once I moved the User directive above the VirtualHost directive, it knew which user to run the CGI script as, and it worked fine.  It also worked when I left the User directive after the VirtualHost directive, but put a User entry within the VirtualHost section.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up an httpd.conf file with the above scenario and run the test.pl script that comes with Apache.
>Fix:
Add information to the documentation about this issue.

 Your problem is caused by the fact that you use the Mandrake version
 of Apache, which should in my opinion be shunned. It turns on too many
 optional features that should not be used unless an experienced admin
 has decided that they are needed.
 
 In your case the feature in question is suexec, and the "experienced
 admin" caveat applies in spades. In particular our documentation
 covers your problem if you use an unmodified Apache.
 
 Tony.
