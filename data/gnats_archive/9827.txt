>Description:
first problem:

after the load of the layout data the value of prefix is set to the
default, i don't know where this setting come from.

| echo $ac_n "checking for chosen layout""... $ac_c" 1>&6
| echo "configure:2698: checking for chosen layout" >&5
| echo "$ac_t""$layout_name" 1>&6

| prefix="$orig_prefix"

second problem:

configure aren't able to reflect another configfilelocation than
conf/httpd.conf

| AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(SERVER_CONFIG_FILE, "conf/$progname.conf",
|         [Location of the config file, relative to the Apache root directory])

The SERVER_CONFIG_FILE problem has been fixed in CVS
