>Description:
The Allow and Deny part of the proxy module does not work correctly as far as I
can tell. I have used the syntax as recommended in the docs:

<Directory proxy:*>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 128.104.30.130 128.104.20.10
</Directory>

But, this does not work correctly. It does deny everyone to things like
GET http://www.linux.org/
or
GET http://www.ssc.org/

But allows everyone access to:
GET http://www.linux.org/index.html
or 
GET http://www.linux.org/help/index.html

Basically, it lets everyone through if the URL they request doesn't end with /
>How-To-Repeat:
Just setup apache as a proxy and try and limit access.
>Fix:
I tried to dig through the code but no luck yet. This is a big security hole 
for anyone running apache as a proxy. 

Maybe my <Directory proxy:*> syntax is wrong in the access.conf file%3
