Solaris 2.5, gcc 2.7.2.1, php 2.0
>Description:

The include files in 1.3a1 (and before) were all in the src directory.

In 1.3b2 they are in src/main src/modules/proxy src/modules/standard os/unix etc etc

This means that to compile php as an Apache module (which needs several .h files from Apache),
I must add many include paths.

Why was this organisation changed?  Can it be changed back?

Thanks.

State-Changed-Why:
The entire tree was reorganised to provide for
operating system abstraction (among other things).
Apache now supports two distinct OSes, UNIX and Win32.
Rather than trying to move files around, just add the
appropriate -I clauses to your CCFLAGS line in Configuration.
Better still, check out the PHP site, because I believe
it may have information about what you need to alter to
work with the new directory structure - because the
structure isn't going to change back.

Thanks for reporting this, though, and for using Apache!
