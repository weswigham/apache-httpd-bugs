Linux www.virtualschool.edu 2.0.30 #1 Sun Jul 19 14:49:01 EDT 1998 i586 unknown
Server Version: Apache/1.3.3

>Description:
After working flawlessly for months, apache has started crashing (several times a day) with this in the error log

[Mon Dec 14 18:12:26 1998] [emerg] (9)Bad file number: flock: LOCK_EX: Error getting accept lock. Exiting!

Nothing had changed; no recompiles, installs, etc. I've rebooted, fsck'd, etc, but nothing helped.


 
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't see how you can. This worked great for months, then kaboom. 
>Fix:
Lincoln Stein reports he's encountered the very same problem and that this has been reported several times in this DB. On his suggestion, I've made this change to include/ap_config.h and am trying it out now. Too soon to say whether this fixes it.

/* flock is faster ... but hasn't been tested on 1.x systems */
/* bjc: #define USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT */
#define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT

State-Changed-When: Tue Mar 16 08:17:23 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
OK I switched the default back to fcntl() on linux... folks
can override it with -DUSE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT in their
EXTRA_CFLAGS.
