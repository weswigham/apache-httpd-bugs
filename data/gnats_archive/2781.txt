Slackware 3.5 Linux, 2.0.35 kernel

The defaultest config runs with help switches, but doesn't
persist as a daemon, doesn't show in ps x. Via ./httpd or
the exact apaci directions. Note that I did not remove apache 1.1
before the build.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Slack 3.5 with httpd and install 1.3.1 on top, stone default.
Someone else in EFnet #linux had the same problem today.
I did ./configure        (no prefix)
>Fix:
Your install setup is the nicest I've ever seen, too bad it didn't
work. I think there could be an even simpler minimal config.
"make test-only-server" or something.

 Right, and 1.3 will as well if you disable it by removing the:
 
 #define HAVE_SHMGET 1
 #define USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD
 
 from the Linux section of src/include/ap_config.h, and possibly replacing
 with:
 
 #define USE_MMAP_SCOREBOARD
 
 But the best thing is just to make your kernel support it.
