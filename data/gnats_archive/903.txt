>Description:
When a .htaccess file appears in the root of a directory tree, all .htaccess
files within subdirectories of that tree appear to be ignored.	

We have our system set up by default (in access.conf) to place authentication 
on specific directories and allow for the developers to change them with 
.htacces files as they wish
>How-To-Repeat:
In the access.conf, put authenticaion on a directory... ie
<DIRECTORY /path/to/directory>
AuthName Whatever
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /path/to/passwd/file
require valid-user
AllowOverride All
</DIRECTORY>

Then, in the directory specified above, create a .htaccess file with:
allow from all
satisy any

now place a .htaccess file within a subdirectory of that one, that contains
AuthName Protected Area
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /path/to/user/file/.htpasswd
require valid-user


When you go to the protected directory, it will be open with no authentication
needed.

State-Changed-Why:
If you use 'Satifsy Any' you enable access control either
by deny/allow _OR_ by password.
If a host passes the deny/allow lines no pasword
authentication is need, if it is denied by mod_access
the user needs to enter a password.

If you want to use password authentication in a
subdirectory you need to change the Satisfy
directive to 'All' (the default value), either in the
parent .htaccess file or in the .htaccess file of the
subdirectory itself.
