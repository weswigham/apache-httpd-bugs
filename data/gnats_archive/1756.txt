OS: Solaris
	SunOS star5 5.5.1 Generic_103640-09 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
  and
	SunOS star4 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

Compiler: GCC
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.5/2.7.2/specs
gcc version 2.7.2

Server:
	Server version Apache/1.2.4 (FrontPage/3.0.3)
>Description:
Since mid of december 97 we caught the following error for about 
 7-10 times with three different servers (all Version 1.2.4):

After restarting the server (via -HUP) the server fails to initialize
some clients, reporting the following message into the error log:

accept: (client socket): Operation not supported on transport endpoint

The server repeats to write this message into the logfile, 
until restarted (stop & start, not HUP).
So (of course) the first times of occuring, it killed our free disk space, 
writing of about 100000 lines of error_log / minute.

This problem may be related to Problem # 872 (already closed),
but under Solaris compiling with '#define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT'
is the default since Version 1.2.0 (see CHANGES and conf.h)
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm sorry, but the error really rather seldom occured for now.
We aren't either available to repeat it.
>Fix:
Just a workaround (a small sh-skript to detect the error, restart the server
and complain about per e-mail). Called by cron very often after
midnight (log rotating) and automatically after reconfiguration of the 
server.

State-Changed-Why:
You might also want to try defining -DNO_SLACK in EXTRA_CFLAGS
when you compile the server.  It's possible that there's still a
really latent bug that our solaris workaround doesn't catch...

State-Changed-Why:
As of 1.2.6 this problem shouldn't fill your
disk with errors, it'll report it once and then the child
with the problem will die.  I suspect also that it will
recover from this bug automatically (which looks to be a
solaris libc/kernel problem).  You can give the prerelease
a try if you like:

ftp://dev.apache.org/httpd/dist/apache_1.2.6.tar.gz

Tell us if the 1.2.6 server still needs a hard restart when this
problem happens.

 Hello Dean & apache Workers,
 
 thanks for the new version.
 
 One of our server is now up and running with this version,=20
 but without -DNO_SLACK option (see below).
 (Alltogether we now discovered this behaviour for about 5 servers.)
 I will report any problems.
 
 I also tried out the NO_SLACK option (reported on Feb 7th) and
 the problem doesn't occur on the server with that binary applied
 for the last 14 days.
 
 Mit freundlichen Gr=FC=DFen / best regards,

Do you have any new information on the problem?  Does 1.2.6
seem to fix it?

Thanks

 Sorry, but the answer is yes:
 
 compiled without any changes to the flags (but including =
 
 modules such as Frontpage 3.0.3), esp. without -DNO_SLACK the =
 
 error occured this night after rotating the logfiles:
 
 >head log/error_log
 [Tue Mar 10 00:00:18 1998] accept: (client socket): Operation not support=
 ed on =
 
 transport endpoint
 [Tue Mar 10 00:00:18 1998] Server configured -- resuming normal operation=
 s
 [Tue Mar 10 00:00:18 1998] accept: (client socket): Operation not support=
 ed on =
 
 transport endpoint
 
 It has been written for about 788 times to the error_log when it has
 been caught be a cron job (which I posted before) at about one minute
 later. The server then has been stoped and restarted.
 
 What next ?
 
 Jan

 Well,
 
 some of the servers are now running with 1.3.1 for about four =
 
 weeks. (Sorry, but I didn't got the time to try 1.3b)
 
 The problem doesn't occur with 1.3.x so far.
 
 Greetings,
