>Environment:
MacOS-X Server 1.01, 1.2, both fully patched. cc --version = 2.7.2.1. Running WebObjects 4.5, both unpatched and patch 2. Running WebObjects as apache module.
>Description:
This problem occurs randomly. The child processes do not appear able to service requests.

I have tried re-compiling 1.3.12, and have also tried 1.3.14 on the 1.02 box. This did not affect the frequency of crashes. Yet to try 1.3.14 on the main production box, but I am wary of doing this since it didn't help on the other box.

On the MOSX1.02 box, it can happen several times a day, on a machine which is not serving much but is a development machine. On our main production server (MOSX1.2, WO4.5PR2) this occurs randomly about once a week. Does not appear to be necessarily load related -- WebObjects complains about load without apache falling over.
The "root" apache process dies, silently. There is nothing written to /var/log/system.log or any other apache log that I can see. In order to restart apache I have to manually kill the child processes individually (via script!) - otherwise apachectl tries to start apache without doing this, and apache barfs as it sees the child processes still sitting there.

This problem has been discussed in the WebObjects mailing lists. See http://www.omnigroup.com/community/developer/mailinglists/

>How-To-Repeat:
It's random. I have not been able to force it. Sorry, no URL etc.
>Fix:
Others on the WebObjects mailing lists are writing cron scripts to check for this condition, and having some success. But it's an awful kludge.
