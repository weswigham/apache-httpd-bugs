This is NOT at all important, just a question...
>Description:
Just wondering why you chose to use the code segment...

<src>/configure:729-741

To prepend 'apache' to sysconfdir,etc iff 'apache' is not in sysconfdir

I figure it is to keep users from polluting /etc or whatever, but the
behavior wasn't defined really well in the docs...
>How-To-Repeat:
run ./configure without the string 'apache' in the prefix path and any files
under $prefix/var or $prefix/etc end up as $prefix/var/apache/ $prefix/var/etc
>Fix:
This does not require any kind of fix, but it would be nice if it was documented
better. If this is the GNU-compatible way, disregard my ignorance, but it
caught me (albeit not for long).

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the hint. We really fogot to document
it. I've now added a large hint to the INSTALL
document which described the behaviour. Thanks for
your report.
