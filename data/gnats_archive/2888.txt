Linux, debian 1.3.1-3 package	
>Description:
This problem was supposed to have been fixed by PR#1155, however I think the patched code was placed in a section that allows it to not work if your using CGI scripts.

I have done the following in my httpd.conf file for a certain domain:

RedirectMatch /(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/test.html?structure=$1

It writes it to the log as File does not exist: ..../test.html?structure=whatever.
>How-To-Repeat:
The site is on an Intranet of mine but heres a slice of the httpd.conf file I use

<virtualhost ..>
...
ServerName olddomain.com
RedirectMatch /(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/test.html?structure=$1
</virtualhost>

And if you go to:

http://www.olddomain.com/this_is_whatever.html

it'll forward it to http://www.domain.com/test.html?structure=this_is_whatever.html

However because when it looks for the file/parses the URL for CGI data it sees the ? %3f.
>Fix:
Change the location of parsing escaped characters to be sooner, or as they are read in from the client.

State-Changed-Why:
A few questions:

1. I've looked at the code and couldn't find
   a relation to any CGI things. Why do you
   think it has something to do with CGI?
   Your example doesn't use CGI...

2. I've tried out your example
   RedirectMatch /(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/test.html?structure=$1
   and it worked fine for me under Apache 1.3.2-dev.
   Can it be that you're using a slightly different
   directive or a Redirectmatch in a different
   context (which could be the reason for the failure)?
