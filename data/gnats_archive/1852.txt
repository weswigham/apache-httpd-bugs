>Description:
This problem will only occur if your mail server is not the web server.
What happens is if you want to have a domain say test.com.. DO NOT PLACE
test.com in your DNS under your reverse pointer tables as the first entry!
Enter www.test.com and then test.com. If you try to send e-mail, sendmail
looks at the route you have in place (45.34.2.1 -> test.com) from your 
network.conf file (order hosts, bind or bind, hosts) and believes that
test.com is local.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try it out: if your mailserver is different from your webserver, put
apache.org as the first entry under the reverse tables
149  IN PTR   apache.org.
149  IN PTR   www.apache.org.
mail originating from the webserver will no longer work if sent to
*@apache.org. But will work if the entries are reversed.
>Fix:
hostname before domain name

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... what does this have to do with Apache?

If you want to configure your mail server and DNS so that
mail is handled on a different server than your web service,
then you simply have to configure that.  I'm not sure what
you are trying to report or what it has to do with Apache...

In general, the order of DNS entries does not matter and they
may be reordered by servers so you must not rely on any order.

If your problem is with sendmail treating the reverse lookups
of all interfaces as local, then you simply have to either
configure sendmail to not do that or use a different name in
the reverse.
