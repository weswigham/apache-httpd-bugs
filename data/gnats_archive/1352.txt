>Description:
A coding issue in the mod_cgi.c module prevents the proper display in the error
log file of the filename causing a specific error.  
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, easily.
>Fix:
Analysis shows that the aplog_error is not being called correctly from the 
subroutine  log_scripterror().  The "fmt" argument is missing.

diff -c to correct this problem is:
