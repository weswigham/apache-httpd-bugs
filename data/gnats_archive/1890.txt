>Environment:
Windows 95, 4.00.950B
Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0
>Description:
Files created by Apache as a caching proxy have names that are only 22 characters long. 
This is only a problem because the proxy_hash function for WIN32 encodes the 128 bit hash into 26 characters. 

This is not a problem which will stop Apache from working properly.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run Apache as a caching proxy server under WIN32. Observe the length of the filenames created in proxy directories.
>Fix:
Change the lines at the end of the proxy_hash function in proxy_util.c. 
Only do this for the #ifdef WIN32 version.
Change from
    memcpy(&val[i], &tmp[k], 22 - k);
    val[i + 22 - k] = '\0';
to
    memcpy(&val[i], &tmp[k], 26 - k);
    val[i + 26 - k] = '\0';
