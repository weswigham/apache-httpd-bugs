When using multiple Listen directive, the environnment variable SERVER_PORT
always return 80 instead of the port value. 
>How-To-Repeat:
replace in httpd.conf 'port xxxx' with at least one 'listen xxxx' directive
and call test-cgi
then Server_port return 80 instead of xxxx

State-Changed-Why:
This is the expected behaviour actually.  Each server has
exactly one ServerName and one Port.  The Listen directive
tells apache which sockets to listen on, but doesn't tell
it what the main server's (or any other server's) Port setting
is.  Consider the case of multiple Listens, each intended
for a different virtual host.

You'll have to set Port in the main server config.  If you
have a need to serve the same config on multiple ports and
have SERVER_PORT set for each port
you will have to use multiple VirtualHosts.

Thanks for using Apache.
