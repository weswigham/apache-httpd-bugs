>Description:
I am porting a ".c" CGI program from Linux to Win32, things work OK on Linux, but 
on Win32 (using standard CGI).

I am using multipart mime to send 2 files to the CGI program. when I send 
more than about 64Kb of data The "connection reset by peer "message is displayed 
on the browser. When sending to the same program on Linux all works OK.

If I send about 20Kb of data, the number of bytes I am able to read is always less 
than the CONTENT_LENGTH variable indicates. This happens for all browsers I have tried

Comment-Added:
What if you use fread() instead of messing with fileno()
and accessing the raw descriptor?  Technically, it is NOT valid
to use fileno() to read from a device that can't seek.

 Marc,
 
 I started off  using fread, this seems to do exactly the same.
 Even if I put the read / fread in a loop as below I still only get part of
 the post.
 
 TotalRead =0;
 do{
     Read = fread(ptmp,1,ContentLength,stdin);
     TotalRead +=Read;
 }while(!feof(stdin));
 
 I have now tried using Borland C++ Builder and get exactly  the same
 results, so I don't think it's the VC+ libraries
 
 Has anyone ever had the multipart mime stuff working on Win32? is there any
 sample code ?? - please.
 
 I have not recently looked through the win32 code for mod_cgi but am about
 to, does the handing of multipart mime differ from that of a straight
 post?. Is there a limitation on the file sizes which can be "posted" to a
 WIN32 console application??

 By the way,
 
 This problem is definitely specific to multipart mime only on the win 32
 platform
 hmm....
 
 If I get a result I'll be in touch .....

State-Changed-Why:
There's a magic set_buffer thing you need to do to force
stdin to be in binary mode.  I don't have it handy, but
if you can't find it in your manuals, there's a PR describing
it in the database here.  http://bugs.apache.org/
