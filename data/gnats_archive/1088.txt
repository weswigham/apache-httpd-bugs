>Description:
I wrote a CGI script with CGIC 1.05 library ( available at www.boutell.com ) and 
the apache server reports a problem of "premature end of script header" whereas this script works perfectly with NCSA httpd. I have read about problems of this type in PR#1011 and PR#286, but even with the use of fflush or by disabling KeepAlive it doesn't work. This script works perfectly "off-line".

State-Changed-Why:
We really are unable to help users debugging their CGI scripts.
Just because it works with NCSA doesn't mean not working
with Apache is a problem with Apache; in 99% of such cases
there is a user error in the CGI.

Your best bet would be to cut the script down to a minimum
that still shows the problem and post to
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi.
