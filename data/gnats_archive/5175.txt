>Description:
Apache forces a content-type string to be set in its http response even though
RFC 2068 7.2.1 states:

   Any HTTP/1.1 message containing an entity-body SHOULD include a
   Content-Type header field defining the media type of that body.

I believe there should be an option to not set a content-type in a response.
The specific case where this is true is of a proxy. The proxy module that ships
with apache does not add a content-type header when none is found in the
response from the remote server. I've written a specialized proxy handler with
mod_perl. The proxy does the right thing by not modifying (or inserting) the
content-type header, but during http_protocol.c's ap_send_http_header function,
a content-type header is forced onto the response:

    if (r->byterange > 1)
        ap_table_setn(r->headers_out, "Content-Type",
                  ap_pstrcat(r->pool, "multipart", use_range_x(r) ? "/x-" : "/",                          "byteranges; boundary=", r->boundary, NULL));
    else if (r->content_type)
        ap_table_setn(r->headers_out, "Content-Type", r->content_type);
    else
        ap_table_setn(r->headers_out, "Content-Type", ap_default_type(r));
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I would suggest adding a "None" option to the DefaultType directive to
accomodate situations such as the above, which abide by the flexibility
provided by the HTTP specification.
