State-Changed-Why:

Try uninstalling and reinstalling apache from scratch.
I'm not able to make heads or tails from that debug info,
it looks like it walked out of it's own memory.

Also, you may have some very obscure config error, please
start again from the default .conf file and see if the
problem still occurs.
