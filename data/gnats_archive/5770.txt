Hello,

I have compiled my apache with -DBUFFERED_LOGS.
Is it possible to write out the entries ordered by time?

Greetings

State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Thu Oct 26 15:08:28 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Since each server process buffers its own log entries,
there is no way to write in cronological order.  You
should not user BUFFERED_LOGS, or you should
post-sort your logs.
