>Environment:
SunOS test-ino 5.5.1 Generic_103640-04 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10
>Description:
In the function get_pw in mod_auth.c Apache attempts to grab the
password field out of the password file and return it for a given
user.  This code assumes that the password file will be formated
like "username:password" and will never contain any additional
colon seperated information.  The 'AuthUserFile' documentation does
not explicitly state that you can store anything besides a username
and a password in in the file, that's why this is a change-request
rather than a sw-bug.  It should be noted that the O'Reilly Apache
book encourages you to store extra stuff in the password file.

State-Changed-Why:
There are two other PRs already requesting the same thing.
The change has been implemented in the 1.3-dev development
source tree.  It is similar to the one you submit, except
that the pstrdup() isn't required because getword() does
it itself.
