>Environment:
Win 95b, Apache 1.3.9, Apache Jserv 1.1b3, webmacro 0.89.1
>Description:
Webmacro servlet throws a NullPointerException on init. 
May be connected with bug no 3329

>How-To-Repeat:
It only affects webmacro servlets, /jserv/ and /servlets/IsItWorking are fine.
Maybe its my fault. 
Sorry if it is.
>Fix:
Commenting out lines 548 to 560 in JServServletManager.java did it for me.
I think that NullPointerException should be being ignored, but am not worthy to 
suggest such.

/*
        try {
            InputStream argsIn =
                loader.getResourceAsStream(classname.replace('.', 
                    File.separatorChar) + ".initArgs");
            if (argsIn != null) {
                try {
                    initargs.load(new BufferedInputStream(argsIn));
                } finally {
                    argsIn.close();
                }
            }
        } catch(IOException ignored) {}

State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:29:47 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/

JServ 1.1.2 is the recommened release of that module.
