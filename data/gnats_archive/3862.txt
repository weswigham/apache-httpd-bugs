make[2]: *** [libhttpd.so] Error 255

So far as I can make out, the linker is expecting both the list of
symbols to be imported (-bI:) and the list of symbols to be exported
(-bE:) to already exist.  Unfortunately, the latter--which should
hold, I believe, all the symbols in all the .o files listed (?)--does
not exist.  If I create it by hand (a simple column of ar -w output, minus 
the .o containers),  I see spew of warnings about duplicate symbols, then
compile trips at next target (libhttpd.ep).

Works fine without DSO support.  Works fine with DSO support on solaris 26 (fwiw)

I've tried.  Failed.  Hoping your aix maven can shed a little light on this.
