>Environment:
We are running on a linux operating system with apache 1.2 loaded. We are using
the Netscare browser.
>Description:
Our web site is pointed to from many other web sites.  We are trying to obtain
the referring site for each hit. However most hits do not have a referrer.  We
ran a test where we started on our site, went to one of the sites that has
a link to our site, and then hit the link to our site.  The log did not show
anything for referrer.  When we ran the same test and cleared cache after we
selected the site that had our link, we were able to obtain that site as
a referrer.
>How-To-Repeat:
Our site is www.stats.com.  A site that has a link to us is 
http://zonestore-espnet.sportszone.com/index.html
>Fix:
NO, but would like one

State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately the presence or absence of a Referer header is
entirely the responsibility of the browser.  If it's not present
then the browser didn't send one... and apache can't do anything
to help that situation.

If you really want to track where your ad hits came from I suggest
that you use distinct urls (like /offsite-ad?1, /offsite-ad?2, ...)
which you redirect to whatever page it is that you really want to
serve.
