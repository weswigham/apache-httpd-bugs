>Description:
Actually I couldn't find information about the HTTP_REFERER env variable.
1. Where it comes from? ( i mean how apache server gets it from browser and 
do all browsers support it )
2. How apache behaves with HTTP_REFERER when browser uses proxy server?
  (f.e. squid)

If you could answer these questions please let me know.

Thanks,
With best wishes,
Darius Ivanauskas.

P.S. Sorry for my english, it isn't my first language :(

State-Changed-Why:
We are unable to answer basic support questions here.  This
is for reporting bugs.  There are other methods clearly
described before you submit a bug report.

If you look at the CGI spec, you will find that the HTTP_*
variables are from headers sent by the client.  If you look
at the HTTP spec you will find what the referer variable is.
