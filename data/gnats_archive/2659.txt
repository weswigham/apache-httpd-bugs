Here a 1:1 copy of email with the maintainer? of mod_auth_mysql.c:

- - - - 
I'm not familiar with Apache 1.3.0, but somewhere along the lines it seems
like the auth module isn't getting compiled, or it's getting compiled in
the wrong place.  Look for mod_auth_mysql.so somewhere in the source tree,
if you can't find it - it's not getting compiled for some reason...

 A few hints:
 
 1. Currently there is no way to link DSO files against other libraries. A
    patch is available (and was posted to new-httpd by me recently) but no
    release version still contains support for this. So as an implication you
    _CANNOT_ use --enable-shared=auth_mysql. 
 
 2. Because of 1.) the only correct way to build your Apache with
    mod_auth_mysql is to use the following:
 
    $ LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/mysql/libraries" LIBS="-lmysqlclient" \
      ./configure \
      --add-module=/path/to/your/mod_auth_mysql.c 
      ...
