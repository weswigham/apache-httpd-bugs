>Description:
I modified mod_autoindex to use, as icons, thumbnails of each image.

demo at: http://fury.ittc.ukans.edu:8080/demo/

The config for this looks like:
AddIconByType (IMG,/cgi-bin/thumb?%s) image/*

if you cgi script is cooler than mine:
AddIconByType (IMG,/cgi-bin/coolthumb?file=%s&size=100x100) image/*

Basically, if you put a %s in the icon name, it will be replaced with
the filename.  Ugly hack - just use sprintf.

Here is my thumb cgi script.  Let me know if it has massive security flaws,
as I expect it does...

#!/usr/bin/perl
$dir="/usr/local/apache/htdocs";
$_=$ENV{QUERY_STRING};
exit if /(\.\.)|\;|\&|\|/; # only should allow normal filenames
s/(\/\/+)/\//g;
$file="thumb_$_"; #cache this thing
$file=~s/\//_/g;
$file="/tmp/thumbnails/${file}.jpg";
system("convert -geometry 100 \"$dir/$_\" \"$file\"") if not -f $file;
print "Content-type: image/jpeg\n\n";
print `cat $file`;

Interesting modification.  We'll keep it on record
here in the bug database for anyone else to use.
I think it is a little too specific an application
to be incorporated in the main server, but we 
appreciate the contribution.

Thanks for using Apache!

 Thanks for providing apache.  One indicator of its good design
 is that someone like me can pick up the code and quickly put
 in a mod.  I had little trouble getting it to work.
 
 Regarding the specificity of the application - I hope I made it 
 clear that the feature is configurable, not default.  I asked 
 a few people if there was such a mod and everyone I asked thought
 there should be.  Keep it in mind (and perhaps do it right - I 
 realize my version was a quick hack) as a future feature.
 
 I am attaching the updated patch - this one handles spaces in
 the filename correctly.  
 
 cheers,
 pete
