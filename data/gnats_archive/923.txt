 Phil, could you try compiling the program below.  Save it as
 "test-bind.c" and then execute: 
 
 cc -o test-bind test-bind.c -lsocket
 
 When you run it "./test-bind" it should count from 0 to 19.  Tell me what
 happens. 
 
 Also could you please send me the output of "showrev -a" for your system. 
 
 Thanks
 Dean

 Phil, please try the patch below.  You have to reverse the old patch (use
 patch -R, or unpack apache_1.2.1 again and retrieve the original
 http_main.c out of it).
