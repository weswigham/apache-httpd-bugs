 My apologies if I've missed something.  But I've looked in the location,
 <URL:http://www.apache.org/docs/>, to which you refer and have not found
 an online doc on httpd.conf ( or the specific differences between inetd
 or standalone as the ServerType).
 
 	Thanks,

 	Sigh.
 
 	We really are not in the customer support biz.  There are 
 	other forums more approprate for that, netnews for example.
 
 	Either searching for ServerType, or diving into 
 	"run-time configuration directives" will provide more
 	info.

 Sorry,
 
 	I thought I was notifying you of a bug in the documentation.
