>Environment:
Redhat Linux 5.1
EGCs Compiler 1.1
output from uname -a = Linux <hostname omitted> 2.0.35 #7 Thu Oct 1 23:20:43 PDT 1998 i686 unknown
>Description:
We have set up about 10 virtual hosts on this Linux box.
All hosts work properly, with an entry in DNS for the web site,
and a VirtualHost entry in httpd.conf. The latest one that
has been added will point the web browser to the root directory
and not to the directory containing the customer's web page.
We have since moved this page to another machine, for the time being,
until I can get this problem resolved. I have compared the entries in http.conf on the 
other machine and they appear to be identical. I have read through the faq, 
1.2.4 documetation, several hundred web sites, and the bug data base. 


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
>How-To-Repeat:
As I stated, we have moved this site to an alternate server, temporarily.
>Fix:
At this point, no.

State-Changed-When: Wed Oct  7 05:39:24 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Please try upgrading to 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 when it is released.
We cannot support older versions of Apache forever, and there
have been many upgrades since 1.2.4.  If this problem can be duplicated
on a newer release, please let us know.

Thank you for using Apache
