>Description:
I installed apache for Windows, but when I try to run it, I get this error:
APACHE.EXE: cannot determine local host name.
Use the ServerName directive to set it manually.

I went into you bug database and found an article on exactly the same problem (PR 670).  I tried your suggested fix, but had no luck.  You suggested "You should be able to get away with "ServerName localhost".  I went into the http_core.c file and added "ServerName seth_js" (seth_js is the name of my computer) to the begining of the file?  Did I do the right thing?
Thanks...

 Hi,
 
 Add "ServerName localhost" in httpd.conf and restart
 the Apache server.
