>Description:
With apache 1.3.4 comes a most likely under documented feature of the new
configure program.....the config.layout file.  The defaults contained in the
released 1.3.4 package are DIFFERENT from the 1.3.3 release causing some
location differences.  In 1.3.3, the "GNU" layout (in 1.3.4 config.layout) 
was employeed.  I was surprised that with the same configuration and run
files that things were placed in areas different than 1.3.3 thus confusing
some of support programs and me.  My first clue, I installed and generated
the new apache 1.3.4 but then looked at the mod output and noticed that the
restarted httpd was still 1.3.3.

This type of change MUST be documented as a README in the base distribution 
directory instead of having everybody run into it and become confused.  I'll
bet others are having this problem too.



>How-To-Repeat:
oh yes....
>Fix:
README file in the base distribution indicating how this feature works.

 One thing forgotten, is that I removed the + after the
 directories on the GNU layout to get it to be the same
 as the 1.3.3 release distribution.
 
 BTW, I DO like the feature, but not the lack of information here.
