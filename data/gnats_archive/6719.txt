I am running Windows 98, but that's hardly relevant.
>Description:
I have a servlet that creates a helper class (QueryResponse) to analyse the body of a POST request. That body is an XML document, so I have been using Sun's Jaxp reference implementation to parse the reqest. In the jserv.properties (wrapper.classpath) file, the path to the Jaxp implementation was incorrect (a space too much). The following call caused a NullPointerException to be thrown:

QueryReport qr = new QueryReport(param1, param2);

It's an error on my side, but the error reporting should be improved.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above
>Fix:
A couple of things would be good: 
- first, when loading the jserv.properties file, verify that each classpath is an existing directory (in wrapper_config_classpath(), I guess)
- second, if there is a run-time error, throw an exception that gives more information. I haven't looked for where this should happen.
