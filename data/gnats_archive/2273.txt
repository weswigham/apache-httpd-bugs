>Environment:
Citrix Winframe server version 1.7 service pack 5
>Description:
I've setup a applicationserver with Citrix Winframe. The applications are served via webpages. Therefor I run Apache on th eCitrix Winframe server (wich is basicly running Windows NT 3.51) When I try to protect the applications to run only in the university domain (.uva.nl) access remains allowed for everyone.
I use exactly the same .htaccess file as on our main webserver (where it works)
and I checked the permissions (Everyone has READ access in Windows NT terms)
Is it possible anyway to get this working under Citrix Winframe (NT 3.51)
>How-To-Repeat:
Try http://145.18.84.46 wich should be protected for the .uva.nl domain.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid we cannot be of much assistance with this for
a couple of reasons:

 1. 1.3b3 is quite old (several months).
 2. We do not support the Apache Web server on any version
    of Windows NT prior to V4.0

When 1.3b7 is released (hopefully soon), you might want
to try that version to see if it addresses your problem.
Good luck, and thanks for using Apache!
