>Environment:
Linux due 2.2.14 #3 Tue Feb 15 03:39:18 BRST 2000 i386-slackware-linux
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
Server Version: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.7.0 OpenSSL/0.9.5a PHP/4.0.3pl1
>Description:
If we request a file named "x.html" as http://www.apache.server/x apache sends
the contents of "x.y" to the client and, sometimes, logs an entry like this:

[Tue Oct 17 20:35:39 2000] [error] [client 1.2.3.4] no acceptable variant: \
/httpd/htdocs/x

This occurs with any extension and only in "Document Root" directory.

Sorry. I don't think I have the necessary C skill to bring you a patch to
correct this all by myself.
