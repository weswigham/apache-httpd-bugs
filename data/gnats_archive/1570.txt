>Environment:
OpenBSD 2.2/sparc
gcc 2.7
>Description:
When compiling with standard options, running apache will cause the following
errors to stderr:

Cannot open scoreboard file:
/var/log/httpd/apache_runtime_status: Permission denied

Apache will reach the MaxClients number of children without retaining any children,
but main server will not die off. The fact that MaxClient has been reached
is logged in the global error logfile, but might give user the wrong idea about
what is going on.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Remedy: see bug report 1061 (FreeBSD) : define -DHAVE_MMAP in Configuration
file's EXTRA_CFLAGS to obliterate need for the ScoreBoard file and use
the shared memory instead.

State-Changed-Why:
Please try 1.3b3; 1.3a1 is very obsolete (we really can't keep
answering the same questions about old betas, and especially
old alphas).  There is a known bug that has been fixed.

We will look at changing it to default to using mmap(),
however we have to be sure that all resonable versions
of the OS support it (not just newer ones) before we
can do that...
