>Description:
I add the following alias to my httpd.conf
Alias /configuration/ /export/home/mjfrazer/public_html/configuration/

and the cgi scripts that are in that directory no longer get wrapped by
suexec.  Going to the scripts using
~mjfrazer/configuration/script.cgi works fine though.

Note that this could be a possible security issue if you want to give a user
an alias but keep the user from exec'ing programs under the httpd's uid/gid.
>How-To-Repeat:
Add an alias to a directory in a user's web space.
>Fix:
If an alias is to a directory outside of the docroot, suexec should wrap all
scripts.

State-Changed-Why:

Yes, this is a limitation in suexec.  Suexec is 
designed to be simple and secure -- not flexible.
If you are interested in more flexibility, you may
wish to look into something like cgiwrap.

Thanks for using Apache!
