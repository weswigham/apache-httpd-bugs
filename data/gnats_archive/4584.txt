State-Changed-Why:
First of all, are you using src/Configure or configure?
If the latter, the configure script in the root of the
source tree will not notice changes to the Configuration
file. In that case, set the CFLAGS environment variable.

If this isn't your problem, and you're absoutely sure that 
you are actually running the new binary that you compiled,
what specific error messages are you seeing?
are you getting.
