>Description:
Using a set of configs without the "TypesConfig" pointing
at "conf/mime.types" explicitly, including mod_mime.so.
Start the server, the "Configuring Apache to use suexec 
wrapper" appears, and the server exits.  No message is 
placed on the console or in the error file.  :(

To make matters worse, if your ServerRoot is /etc/httpd and
there is a mime.types in /etc, the server starts up and runs
without comment either.

I wasted 12 hours finding out that it was mod_mime that was
causing the server to quit without explanation, and then a couple
more figuring out why it worked on one system and not the other 
(both systems were identical except for mailcap-1.0-3 vs mailcap-1.0-7)
>How-To-Repeat:
See full description
>Fix:
Hows about a meaningful error message in mod_mime.c?

State-Changed-Why:
I have just tried this, and an error was reported in my
error_log.  I believe it is fixed in the latest release, 1.3.2.
Could you please try to reproduce this, and let us know
what happens?

Thank you.
