>Description:
After translations to a few more languages were added, I discovered that the
previous patch I sent in for mod_negotiation.c only fixed half the problem.
It is still possible for a language which is not listed in the LanguagePriority
option to be treated as being as good as a language which is in the list.

The problem is easy to see. In the function is_variant_better, if 
  best->lang_index == 0
and
  variant->lang_index == -1
the function will not return at line 1889 as it should, but continue as
if the variant is as good as the current best.

The previous patch fixed the case where
  best->lang_index == -1
and
  variant->lang_index == 0
didn't get set the variant as being the new best.

It is amazing that it has taken so many attempts to get these few lines correct.
I'm quite sure the patch given fixes the last of this problem.
