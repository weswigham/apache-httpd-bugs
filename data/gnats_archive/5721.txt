Win32 binary file.
>Description:
After installing Apache 1.3.6, I can start it either as a service or as console app. But it looks as if my "httpd.conf" file was not read by the app.
I can't log on to 127.0.0.1:80 and there's nothing on port 80 in my "Winnt\System32\Drivers\etc\services" file.
Otherwise my httpd.conf file seems OK and the line "Port 80" is present.
I am french, so:
- I run it on a french release of Windows NT,
- maybe I forgot something or misunderstood something when reading the docs...
can you help me anyway?
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache on Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0 sp4.
