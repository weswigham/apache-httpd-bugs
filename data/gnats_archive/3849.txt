Apache 1.3.3 treats directories like scripts

I want to be able to have something like
http://xxx.yy.zz/cgi-bin/admin/test

to bring up index.html, but it tries to execute the directory,
THEN if i specify index.html, it tries to execute the .html file

No, I tried in the access.conf specifying Indexes, but no avail.

State-Changed-By: jim
State-Changed-When: Thu Mar 11 18:46:03 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This is because you have Apache configured to run files it finds in cgi-bin. If you do not want that, then you will need to reconfigure that. This is not a bug in Apache.
