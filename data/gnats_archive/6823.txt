 Hello,
 
 For a while I haven't been working cause I have been ill. Anyway I have
 seen you have changed the staus of PR 6768 from open to closed !?
 
 Why ? Did you tried to reproduce the problem if you have a SPARC platform
 with Solaris 2.6 ? What else information I could ship to you ?
 
 core files with the symbols ?
 
 Stefan

State-Changed-Why:

The report was closed because you did not give
enough details to try to debug it, and because
it is very unlikely that this problem is caused
by the core apache server.  If you have more
details as requested in the original Problem Report,
then please send them with the orignal PR# in the
subject line as described above.
Thanks.
