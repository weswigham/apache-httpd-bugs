After compiling and installing 1.3b7 in default location, I changed *only* the port number in
the distributed httpd.conf file.  httpd fails to start with this error:

Syntax error on line 40 of /usr/local/apache/conf/access.conf:

State-Changed-Why:

This is a known problem with the AIX C compiler (see also
PRs 2534, 2664, 2853, and 3042).  IBM are aware of the
problem.  I'm putting this report into 'analyzed' so we
can notify you of the correction if and when we get one.

State-Changed-Why:
The AIX compiler problem which gave the error of
"on Expected </Files> but saw </Files>"  has been fixed.
+  A set of PTF's which correct the problem are available from:
+  http://service.software.ibm.com/support/rs6000
+  The PTF's are:  U462005, U462006, U462007, and U462023 through
+  U462030.  The PTF's have been tested and do indeed fix the problem.

Thanks for using Apache

 Yes, the listed PTF's are for the xlC 3.6.4 compiler.
 Please talk with your IBM Service Rep. to see
 if your compiler is effected.

 These PTF's appear to be for the old AIX compiler, not the latest one
 (i.e. "C for AIX Version 4.3").

Comment-Added:
According to the IBM compiler people:
The AIX 4.3 compiler is old and out of support.
The AIX 3.6.4 C/C++ compiler problem is fixed with the PTF's
listed above
The only forthcoming comiler fix is for the AIX 4.4 C compiler
and this PTF's to fix this will be available in April 99.

Sorry for any confusion that IBM numbering scheme has caused.

Comment-Added:
IBM has released a fix their 4.4 C compiler.
The APAR number is IX87837, you can go to:
http://service.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/support/rs6000.support/downloads
use the AIX Fix Distribution Service, and search on the APAR number above,
it will pull up the updated filesets with the fix.
Evidently this fix has been available for a while, but I just
got wind of the updated APAR. Shane
