The file Apache-1.3-docs.pdf.gz in the download - httpd - documentation 1.3.12 is in reality just a pdf file, but I needed some time to find it out after trying many zip formats.

State-Changed-Why:

Actually, it is in fact gzipped.  However, your browser
is likely decompressing it on-the-fly.

However, I suggest that you not use that file in any
case.  It is a rather old version of the documentation.
Please use the HTML docs on the website.
