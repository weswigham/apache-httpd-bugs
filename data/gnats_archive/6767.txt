>Description:
Hi, 

Many Linux distributions seem to configure logrotate to rotate
httpd's log files and issue a `killall -HUP `pidof httpd`' as a 
post-rotate command.

The `Stopping and Starting' documentation says this causes the parent 
to kill all child processes, re-read its configuration, and re-open its 
log files.

What effect does HUP-ing a child httpd have?  Does it just ignore the 
signal?  The documentation doesn't cover this.

Ralph.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: fanf
State-Changed-When: Tue Oct 31 11:30:26 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Apache forwards restart signals (HUP and USR1) to its
process group, so doing a `killall -HUP httpd` is reasonably
harmless. However, this is an unsupported implementation
detail and therefore subject to change -- it's completely
different in 2.0. You should not rely on it to work. If you
want to rotate the logs of apache-1.3 the best way is to
`kill -USR1` the parent process.

 We do: see http://www.apache.org/docs/stopping.html which says:
 
 :You will notice many httpd executables running on your system, but you
 :should not send signals to any of them except the parent, whose pid is
 :in the PidFile. That is to say you shouldn't ever need to send signals
 :to any process except the parent.
 
 I suggest you file a bug with RedHat.
 
 Tony.
