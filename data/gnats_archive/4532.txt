>Description:
I have tools to analyze the referer_log file but it doesn't exist.
The documentation is way complicated on this topic.  Do I take it
that I need to recompile httpd in order to store the referer_log?

I don't want to know about all the customization options for logging,
I just want a simple referer log.

Thanks
>How-To-Repeat:
seems to be default behavior
>Fix:
activate the referer_log by default or by
a simple command to the server
(w/o asking a webmaster to recompile)
