>Environment:
Solaris 2.7/Sparc/gcc-2.95.1
>Description:
We are running Apache 1.3.9 on two different ports: 80 and 8080

We have some sections like this in our config file:

<location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status
AuthType Basic
require group www-admin
AuthName "Apache Server Status"
</location>

Since the change from 1.3.6 to 1.3.9 this access rule only work
on the virtual host with port 8080 (browser pops password requester), but
not on port 80.

In this case Apache send an error page:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<script language="javascript">                    
function go_back() {
        history.back();

Since this worked with 1.3.6 and no modules in our Apache setup have changed,
their might be a problem
