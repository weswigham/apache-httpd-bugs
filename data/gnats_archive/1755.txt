>Environment:
Windows NT Workstation.  Binaries of Apache 1.3b3 from www.apache.org.
>Description:
The environment variable, PATH_INFO, is being lowercased when my cgi
program is run by Apache.  This causes serious problems for HAHTsite webapps
that encode their stateid in the URL.  The stateid is case sensitive.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just print out the environment from a cgi program.  The PATH_INFO is lowercased.
>Fix:
Don't lowercase the PATH_INFO environment when extracting it from the URL
