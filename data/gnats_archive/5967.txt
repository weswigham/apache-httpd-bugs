Linux 2.2.5-15 on an i586
egcs-2.91.66
>Description:
Near the end of the linking phase in compiling Apache 2.0a2, I
received a "modules/standard/.libs/libapachemod_env.al: could not
read symbols: Archive has no index; run ranlib to add one"
followed by "collect2: ld returned 1 exit status"
which subsequently halted the compiling process.

I cannot now compile Apache2.
Note that this bug is very similar at #5877, and may be a duplicate.
>How-To-Repeat:
N/A (seems perfectly repeatable)
>Fix:
No, sorry.
