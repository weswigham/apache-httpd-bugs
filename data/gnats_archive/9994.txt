GNU/Linux Debian Potato 2.2.18 (with all the newest packages), but I think that this applies to all operating systems

Please see the PHP bug sunmitted at the following address. http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15774

The problem is that if you compile in PHP statically (and I assume this applies for all modules), and *also* try to load it in the config file, apache stops right after you run it, without any errors at all to help you figure out what the problem is.

I spent hours trying to figure out this problem, I suggested to PHP people that this be checked for and noted in a logfile, but if my past experience serves me, the PHP people will say that Apache should do it, and apache will say the PHP people should do it. I am only asking for some coordination, it would be so much nicer. When you get no error, and it could be a Apache or a PHP problem, but really it is both and a vicious  problem. 

>How-To-Repeat:
Compile PHP statically into apache, then put this in your httpd.conf:
LoadModule php4_module        libexec/libphp4.so
>Fix:
A simple check to see if a module is already loaded and a cluestick to the user's head would suffice, "Attempting to dynamically load a module that is compiled in statically".
