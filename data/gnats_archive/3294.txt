>Environment:
several Linux 1.2.13 through 2.0.33 486 through pentium
gcc was used independently on each system - so have very old to brand new
>Description:
simple problem, simple work-around

<!--#exec cgi=path/file.cgi --> used to work (yeah, I know it's not right)
<!--#exec cgi="path/file.cgi" --> or
<!--#exec cgi='path/file.cgi' --> is now required

file is not executed in the former case

1.3 not backwards compatible
>How-To-Repeat:
sure, just do the above in 1.2x then try it in 1.3x. That's what I did.
>Fix:
I would have to guess and say use the same scheme as 1.2x
