>Environment:
HP-UX v10.20 on a H60 (PA7100) platform patched to July97 patch bundle.
Compiled on a HP-UX v10.20 D270 (PA8000) system with +DAH60 compiler switch.
>Description:
The httpd.conf file specifies a user and group to run httpd once started. httpd is started as root.  Upon performing a ps, 7 httpd daemons are running with 6 being children of the intial httpd daemon.  The 6 children httpd daemons show as being owned by the user specified in the httpd.conf file,  However, the parent httpd daemon is still owned by root as is now an orphan of init (pid 1).

Is this normal behavior?  I was under the impression, from reading the doc, that all instances (daemons) would switch to being owned by the user specified in the httpd.conf file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Possibly on a HP-UX 10.20 system

State-Changed-Why:
That is the way it is supposed to work.  The parent has to
run as the user it is started as to do various things they way it is supposed to.
