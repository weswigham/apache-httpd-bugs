AIX 4.x
>Description:
Unlike the binaries for Solaris etc., the AIX downloadable binary doesn't appear 
to contain the executable of the htpasswd utility -- just the htpasswd.c file.

We've built it OK, but I wasn't sure if you were aware of this omission.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Provide the htpasswd utility as an executable.

State-Changed-Why:
Our binaries are kind of random, sorry.  I think there's a
script for folks creating them now, so the newer ones should
be right.  Open a new report if the 1.3.6 binary isn't right,
thanks.
