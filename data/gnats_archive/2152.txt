I'm no C programmer, but after untarring 1.3bg, I ran configure (no arguments),
then make.  I get this:
# make
===> regex
<=== regex
===> os/unix
        cc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DHPUX -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -DUSE_HSREGEX `../../apaci`  os.c

State-Changed-Why:
Can you do a grep through all your header files under
/usr/include and look for rlim_t for me? I'm curious
what it should be.

Jim--

Did grep rlim_t *.h under /usr/include & didn't find anything.  Did the
same under /usr/include/sys and
got:
baalrog:/usr/include/sys $ grep rlim_t *.h
resource.h:#  define _T_RLIM_T rlim_t
resource.h:#  define _T_RLIM_T  rlim_t
types.h:         typedef uint64_t rlim_t;
types.h:#        define k_rlim_t rlim_t
types.h:       typedef unsigned long rlim_t;
