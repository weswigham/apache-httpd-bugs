>Description:
We are using the automounter to mount the different user partitions.
The mounting point is /home and the different user directory are then
mounted as /home/ifh/user-name .  Our web pages are on /home/ifh/www .

The automounter gave an error:

automountd[386]: server .htaccess not responding

that was caused by apache to look for a file /home/.htaccess that it
couldn't find as /home is just a mounting point.  This happend in spite
of the fact that there was an "AllowOverride None" in access.conf for the 
different directories containing web files.

The workaround we found to solve this problem was to explicitely include
the /home mounting point in the access.conf file:

<Directory /home>
AllowOverride None
</Directory>

Hope that's useful for somebody else!

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks.  Yes we actually intend to (or already have) documented
that for best security people should include a <Directory />
section that includes AllowOverride None and limits access
to everyone, and then explicitly allow access to the parts
of the hierarchy they really want to serve.
