>Description:
Syntax error on line 298 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:  Expected   </Directory> but saw </Directory>
>How-To-Repeat:
download the binary (the latest  1.3.17) and try installing.  It seems that it gets hung up with the some syntaxes within the httpd.conf file.  However, I load the binary of 1.3.9 and it works fine.....I even tried 3.1.14 from the website and it didn't work either...ther 1.3.9 version I had from a cd.
>Fix:
NO....i need a way to fix it
