>Description:
Add this to http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/descriptors.html for "Compaq Tru64 UNIX/Digital UNIX/OSF":

If you are out of file descriptors, try these things:
1. Raise open_max_soft and open_max_hard to 4096 in the proc subsystem.
   Do a man on sysconfig, sysconfigdb, and sysconfigtab
2. Raise max-vnodes to a large number which is greater than the number of apache
   processes * 4096
   (Setting it to 250,000 should be good for most people).
   Do a man on sysconfig, sysconfigdb, and sysconfigtab
3. If you are using Tru64 5.0, 5.0A, or 5.1, define -DNO_SLACK to work around
   a bug in the OS.
   CFLAGS="-DNO_SLACK" ./configure
4. Reduce the number of log files by merging them into one, using logsplit  
   programs, or piped logs
