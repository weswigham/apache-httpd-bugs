>Environment:
Solaris 2.6
>Description:
Compile & install Apache 1.3.4 as DSO support with configure script.
Configure Apache Jserv with DSO support. Then you will get the message that
the Apache has not DSO support.
>How-To-Repeat:

 
>Fix:
In configure script. The path to apxs is hardcoded as ${withval}/sbin/apxs.
But Apache 1.3.4 configures sbin directory as APACHE_DIR/bin.
You should add some scripts in order to located apxs script.
