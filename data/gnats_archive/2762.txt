>Description:
If kill_after_timeout is used in an ap_spawn_child, using the pconf pool,
then the child is not killed when the server is killed. Changing to kill_always
appears to fix the problem.

At least, I'm pretty sure that's what's happening.

 This has been happening here as well, with Apache 1.3.5dev.  I've got,
 in my httpd.conf, the line
 ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/aplog.pl"
 .  As you all probably know, apache sees this and runs it using /bin/sh
 as a wrapper, like so:
 /bin/sh -c '/usr/local/bin/aplog.pl'
 .  When apache gets kill -HUPped, it _does_ send the SIGTERM, followed
 by the SIGKILL to the 'sh' process, which dies, but then the aplog.pl
 process doesn't get killed along with it.  You can work around it by
 substituting
 ErrorLog "|exec /usr/local/bin/aplog.pl"
 for
 ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/aplog.pl"
 .
