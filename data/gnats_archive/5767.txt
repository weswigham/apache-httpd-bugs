Not relevant
>Description:
When using a custom layout file (--with-layout=customfile:Custom) that starts immediately with <Layout Custom> in line 1, the sed construction used in configure fails to extract the proper parameters.
This is documented as a feature in the sed man page:
In the construction "sed -e 1,/.../d" sed starts looking for ... from line 2 onwards.
Ofcourse the same holds if you edit the standerd config.layout file.

Any way you like... the problem is rather small.
