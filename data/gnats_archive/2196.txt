this causes a declaration conflict for sys_siglist, which is also provided in
unistd.h.

i commented out #include <signal.h> in include/conf.h and

 Erm... is that the gcc that came with your system or did you install it
 yourself?
 
 Does compiling the following program:
 
 --------
 #include <signal.h>
 #include <unistd.h>
 
 int main () { }
 --------
 
 give the same error?
 
 If so, that isn't anything wrong with Apache but something broken with
 your header files.  I really don't think that BSD/OS is broken like that
 and Apache has been including both for a long time.
