Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-pc-linux-gnu/2.95.2/specs
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)

Apache installed in version 1.2.5. Want to upgrade due to Year2000 issues.
>Description:
[root@gutenberg apache_1.3.9]# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache-1.3.9
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.9 Ben-SSL/1.37
1.3.9
 + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
Creating Makefile
Creating Configuration.apaci in src
Creating Makefile in src
 + configured for Linux platform
 + setting C compiler to gcc
 + setting C pre-processor to gcc -E
 + checking for system header files
 + using custom target name: httpsd
 + adding selected modules
 + checking sizeof various data types
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!
