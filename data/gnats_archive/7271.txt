SunOS 5.8 Generic_108528-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
>Description:
modules/mappers/mod_userdir.c:get_suexec_id_doer()
references members of struct passwd pw without calling getpwnam(),
so causes a coredump when CGI is invoked.

>How-To-Repeat:
configure --enable-cgi --disable-cgid (yes, no cgid)
and make the server invoke CGI several times.
The child httpd will coredump on first couple of tries.
>Fix:
Just adding getpwnam() is easy but I'm not convinced enough to
make this MT-safe.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rbb
State-Changed-When: Thu Feb 22 12:52:08 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This has been fixed in the CVS tree.  The patch was a bit
different, because we need to be thread-safe if we are
using threads.  This required an additional APR function
to deal with threads cleanly.

Thank you for the bug report and the patch.
