>Description:
After clean config/build/install on clean RH7 system, defaunt index page ("/") returns index.html.zh.Big5 instead of index.html.en

Configured with
--enable-module=most
--enable-shared=max
>How-To-Repeat:
On a clean installation of RH7 (w/ no web server) built 1.13.20 from source with configuration:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache
--enable-module=most
--enable-shared=max
Started apache, tested from a windows machine (IE5.5, Win2000)
http://<myhost> returned index.html.zh.Big5 instead of index.html.en.
- determined it was zh.Big5 by comparing file size (1062) and entry in access log  for /
- noticed the .Big5 was the only index.html.* to have execute access, but changing this made no difference, likewise adding execute access to index.html.en.
- renaming the file to anything starting with index.html. does not change the results: the file is returned.  Even if another file is named index.html.zh.Big5.
>Fix:
It must be based on the file's content... but I don't know now mod_negotiation works; does it look inside at the document attributes?

I tried many variations of file names and content copied from other index.html.* and couldn't figure out what the heck caused zh.Big5 to be selected.  (I note that .zh is not represented by AddLanguage, but it didn't seem to matter, because the problem occured regardless of file extensions...

WORKAROUND: delete htdocs/index.html.zh.Big5

State-Changed-Why:
Will be fixed in the next release. Bill Rowe shot the bug and Bill Stoddard ported the fix from 2.0 to 1.3. For future reference, I am adding the significant text of an email exchange between B. Rowe and the bug db author:

>Unformatted:
 >>>> Size is part of the negotation, the very _LAST_ part. >>>> Is your Big5 file actually smaller than the others?
 >>>
 >>> Yes it is.
 >>> I will test by making it much longer:

 >>> Ah, you got it.  Adding much content to 
 >>> index.html.zh.Big5 resulted in .en being served.

 >>> I will now restore it to "short" and test your other

 >>> So, why does size matter...? ;^)

 >>> Ah, there you go!  This fixes the problem:
