This seems to only affect mod_so on solaris  so far as I can tell.

No matter which module I try to create as a shared object, I get an error message pertaining to symbols referenced in one of the /.../apache/include/*.h files.  I've been looking exhaustively for a solution, but haven't found one yet...

An identical apache configuration on a Linux box with apxs-created shared object files works fine.

Thanks for apache! Emery
>How-To-Repeat:
I had difficulty with any module, so I will use the mod_example.c that comes with the Apache1.3.3 distribution:
