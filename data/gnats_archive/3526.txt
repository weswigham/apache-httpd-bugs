>Description:
For whatever reason, I've got a GIF file named 'count.cgi.gif' which is
being referenced by <IMG SRC="count.cgi.gif"...>

It fails to display (using Netscape, but this is probably immaterial).
Apache's error log contains:
[Sat Dec 12 00:08:09 1998] [error] [client 10.0.0.2] Premature end of script headers: /usr/local/apache/htdocs/mcs/html/ihsc/Count.cgi.gif


If I rename the GIF to `count.gif' then it works

At the bottom of the page is the counter image
>Fix:
Well, I'd suspect that whatever is looking for a suffix of `.cgi' is
not making sure that it's a suffix -- a match in the middle of the name
shouldn't trigger anything, should it?

State-Changed-Why:
That is the way it is supposed to work.  If you add a
".cgi" handler then it matches .cgi part anywhere in the URL.

This is the way it is designed to work, although it can be
a little unintuitive at times.  If you setup your CGI scripts
by setting .cgi to the proper mime type instead of using
a handler, that would have the side effect of avoiding this.
