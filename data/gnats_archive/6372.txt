>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 2000 VC++6
>Description:
This server configuration works well under Solaris (Apapche 1.3.6 with mod_proxy+mod_rewrite):

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/	/path/to/cgi-bin
...
ProxyRequests on
...
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^proxy:(.+)$ /cgi-bin/nph-foo?$1 [PT,L]

The nph- script is invoked and the input URL $1 is rewritten.

Under Windows 2000 (same Apache configuration) I have the following error
[Fri Aug 04 11:13:28 2000] [error] [client 13.202.222.141] File does not exist: passthrough:/cgi-bin/nph-foo

It seems that the Alias /cgi-bin is not handled correctly??

If I modify the Rewrite rule this way (proxy instead of passthrough):
RewriteRule ^proxy:(.+)$ /cgi-bin/nph-foo?$1 [P,L]

The script is normally invoked

State-Changed-Why:

Please try Apache version 1.3.12 to see if this behavior 
has been addressed.  Further, be aware that there are many
Win32 corrections to mod_proxy in the forthcoming 1.3.13
release, and you may want to wait for that version in the
first place, if you will be relying on mod_proxy.

 Neither the 1.3.12 nor the 1.3.13-dev (from cvs) versions fix the problem
