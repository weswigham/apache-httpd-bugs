State-Changed-Why:
This is a problem with your CGI, not with Apache.  As
we clearly state, we can't teach people how to write CGIs.
Your script is not outputting the proper CGI headers.
See http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ for a description
of the CGI spec and how the headers have to be
output.  The other errors are from perl.
