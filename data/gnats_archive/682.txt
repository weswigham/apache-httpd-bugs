>Description:
Apache would not work for us for Virtual Hosts.  What it was doing is it was passing per user webs to suexec as ~username, yet for Virtual Hosts it would pass the name as username without the ~.  suexec only recognized the
username as a directory not off of root of it had a ~ on it and would look in the proper /home/.../public_html directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a virtual host and a per user web.
>Fix:
Yes, go to util_script.c line #603 
change it from:

   execuser = pstrdup(r->pool, pw->pw_name);

to:

   execuser = pstrcat(r->pool, "~", pw->pw_name, NULL);

This changes apache to pass the ~username value to suexec.  I've tested
this out, and apparently this has not affected our root or per user webs, and
virtual hosts now work

State-Changed-Why:
As mentioned in the other followup, this is not the way
suexec is designed to work.  The assumption that there
is any relation between virtual hosts and user directories
is not valid.  Yes, suexec is limited in that way but it
works how it is supposed to.
