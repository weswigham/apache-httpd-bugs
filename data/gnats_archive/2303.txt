Windows NT 4.00.1381 (3 Service Pack)
>Description:
I am using pre-compiled binaries for Windows Apache/1.3b6. I have tried Apache/1.3b7 <Win 32>. The problem remains. It is started from the command line (not as a service)

In "httpd.conf" file I have included line:
User Apache_P

The account "Apache_P" have a guest access to my computer.

It looks like the User parameter is not accepted. I have several directories with permission : "Apache_P - No access". Still anybody from the world can access these directories.

State-Changed-When: Fri Oct 23 13:06:44 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The User directive has no affect on Win32.  The reason
for this is because the password for the userid would 
have to be stored somewhere that Apache could read.  This
poses a possible security problem.
If you want to run Apache in the context of a particular
user account, Windows NT already provides this facility
via the Services panel.  This means that you need to 
install Apache as a service.  After Apache is installed
as a service, go to the services panel (click the Services
icon in Control Panel) and click the "Startup..." button.
In that dialog, you can enter the user account under which
you want the server to run.
Code has been added to Apache to indicate that the User
directive has no affect on Win32 in the error log.
