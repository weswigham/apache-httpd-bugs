RedHat Linux 5.1, Kernel 2.0.35. gcc compiler version 2.7.2.3-11.
>Description:
I had trouble installing the suExec module, and once it compiled, it did not appear to be loading when the server loaded. I set the suid bit on the cgi, and the cgi ran as the owner. However, I was able to run cgi's as root. Also, I replaced my apache installation with the original, which was NOT configured to run suEXEC, and the cgi's continued to execute as the owner.
>How-To-Repeat:
chmod 4711 file.cgi; this sets the setuid bit, and apahce will execute the file as the owner.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... yea, so?

That is the way Unix has always worked.  If a program is
setuid then it executes by the user it is setuid to.  That
isn't a bug or a feature in Apache, but just the way things
are on Unix.

Note that this also allows others to excute it setuid
to whatever user you setuid it to, which can lead to
security issues if your CGI isn't secure.

 Yes, subject to the constraints listed in the documentation.
 
 suexec has nothing to do with the setuid bit on files.
