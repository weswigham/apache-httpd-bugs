>Description:
Touch an HTML file in your htdocs, such that it is 0 bytes big.  Access the file via Netscape,
the "Transferring data" seems to stay there for a long time/eternally.  It 
should not take that long to send a "no data" to the client browser or something.
>How-To-Repeat:
Any .html file that is touched...
>Fix:
No, I don't

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... why do you think this is a bug in Apache?  Netscape
has many bugs and will often show bogus things in its status
line.  Do you have any reason to think that Apache actually
has the connection open and it isn't just a problem with
Netscape not changing the status line for 0 length files?

State-Changed-When: Fri Jan 29 20:03:21 PST 1999
State-Changed-Why:
I really don't see any reason to think there is anything
wrong with Apache.  Netscape has bugs in this area (ie.
doesn't properly understand a zero-length content-length
response) so it doesn't think it has got what it asked
for until the persistent connection times out.

Unless you can give some technical reason why you think
Apache is doing something wrong, there is really nothing
we can do.  Apache is almost certainly doing the right thing.
