>Environment:
Linux xxx.xxx.net 2.0.27 #1 Sat Dec 21 23:44:11 EST 1996 i586
The computer is a Pentium 166 with 48 MB RAM
I compiled with the gcc complier that comes with this version of Linux
>Description:
When I start up apache 1.2.5 it seems to run fine for a few minutes, then the entire server
starts to get slower and slower.  If I watch the uptime on the server, it starts
to climb higher and higher (if I do not kill httpd the machine will eventually lock solid). 
It does not spawn more then 100 servers, and usually sits between 92 and 96.  The server gets a lot
of traffic, usually around 100,000 unique hits day.  The only optional module I have complied in is the 
rewrite module (which I need) and the status module.	I watched a TOP session
and noticed that the initial httpd will get up to 99% server utilization.
>How-To-Repeat:
Becuase of the severity, I changed back to my 1.1.3 version.

Nop

 Are there any messages in your error_log? 
 
 Is NFS involved at all?  If so you need to add something like "LockFile
 /var/run/httpd.lock" into your config.

 I belive I may have been able to fix this.  I am still watching, but it is
 run okay for the last 2 hours.  
 I did two things, I removed the mod_status module from the configuration.
 This slowed down the crash.  I also had the ReWrite commands in a
 .htaccess file in the root directory of one of my virtual hosted sites.
 As soon as I removed it, everything calmed back down and went smoothly.  I
 believe it may have been due to the fact that they site is very "deep" ie
 it as several subdirectories, and the ReWrite engine was trying to cover
 them all.  Since I only need it to cover my images directory, I was able
 to put a .htaccess in it and the server runs fine (and correctly) now.
