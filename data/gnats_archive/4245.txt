Dual Proc
256meg
NT 4.0
Srvpack 3 or srvpack 4
4 servers configured the same.
default install with directory and cgi additions in http.conf
>Description:
The apache child process is using 95% to 99% of CPU on both processors.
The site contains about 5gigs worth of downloaded bits. We average about 1000 hits a day. Each time a hit is made we call a CGI that starts a download.
VM memory is ok. Eventually, overtime about 33gigs worth of data has been served the service stops responding and so does the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
The VIP is www.digitalgoods.net.
Behind the VIP are 4 nodes.
>Fix:
Not yet... since I have not compiled the code and tested a debug version.
I am hoping you may have some configuration suggestions.

Thank you for your time.

Comment-Added:
What is MaxRequestsPerChild set to? I suggest you set it to 
0. How much data does each CGI serve up, in the typical 
case? in the extreme case? How many concurrent clients are
active at once? If you find you are have about as many
concurrent clients as your ThreadsPerChild setting, you
should 1. increase ThreadsPerChild and 2. decrease KeepAliveTimeout
or disable it entirely and see if that helps.

Any information that you can provide me that will help me
recreate the problem would be good.
