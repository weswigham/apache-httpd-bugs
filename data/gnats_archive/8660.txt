I'm having a problem and I wondered if it's a bugs.

httpd.conf file:
Alias /site/ "c:\html\test\site"

test.asp file:
<--#include virtual = "/site/test.inc" -->

When I run the test.asp, the file test.inc not found, is this a bug ?
but it does recognize when tried this: http://myserver/site/test.hml

If there is a solution, please let me know. thanks

Could it be that "test.inc" should be "test.hml"?
Seems like a typo in your SSI.

If not, please check the error log and ask your question
on news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows.

Thanks for using Apache!
