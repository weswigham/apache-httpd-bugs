Linux ecwav.panoptic.com 2.0.34 #31337 Mon Jun 22 18:25:40 EDT 1998 i486 unknown

>Description:
Building Apache 1.3.0 on my Linux 2.0.34 box yielded some unsatisfactory
results.  Partly due to the configuration script's inability to detect
the need for -ldl for the --enable-shared=max, and the use of -lcrypt
(which is clearly documented as being needed for glibc 2.x, and my box
is a libc 5.x system, yet the configure script thinks I'm also glibc 2.x).

>How-To-Repeat:
Here is the configure command I used:
./configure --compat --prefix=/usr/www --proxycachedir=/usr/www/cache \
  --enable-module=proxy --enable-module=expires --enable-module=log_referer \
  --enable-module=status --enable-shared=max
>Fix:
Here is a diff with the changes necessary to get a clean build:

---end-of-diff---

The first change would be more appropriate in helpers/TestCompile lib dl,
and have it properly recognize that Linux needs -ldl to build shared
libraries.

The second change should just require better identifying glibc 2.x systems
or Linux systems that require -lcrypt in general.

My patch was just a temporary fix to get Apache 1.3.0 to build cleanly
and to illustrate the problems I encountered.

Good luck, and if you need any more information, feel free to send me
e-mail.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm a little bit confused. Because first Apache built
fine under Debian and RedHat boxes and the src/Configure
script has correct entries to check for -ldl and -lcrypt
IMHO. You say that it's unable to see that -ldl and
-lcrypt is needed. When this is the case then
the TestCompile stuff is broken for you. Can you
try the two TestCompile command manually and see
why they lead to incorrect results on your Linux box?

 I've discovered that the TestCompile script on my box doesn't
 like the "trap" line at the top.  It seems that the TestCompile
 script *always* exits with the status code of 1.  This obviously
 breaks the Configure script for me.
 
 If I duplicate the body of the "trap" code and place it at the
 bottom of the TestCompile script, things work correctly:
 
 if AP_PPSEARCHPATH=`pwd` ./$AP_PRINTPATH -s $TARGET ; then
     exstat=0
 fi
 
 rm -f Makefile dummy testfunc.c testfunc
 exit $exstat
 
 If I don't do this, when the script executes the body of the
 trap command upon script exit, $exstat is always "1".  I bet
 my shell is replacing "exit $exstat" with "exit 1" as that's
 what the value of $exstat is at the time the trap line
 appears.  (Whereas, it shouldn't be substituting at that
 point).  It sounds like this might just be a bug in my
 /bin/sh (which is actually a link to /bin/bash).
 
 Strange.  Anyway, that's just another possible workaround,
 but I should grab a newer version of bash and see if that
 clears it up.  But with my current bash, I need to stick
 the rm/exit lines at the bottom of TestCompile to have it
 work properly.
