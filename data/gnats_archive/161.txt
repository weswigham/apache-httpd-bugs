>Description:
Problem reported for 1.2b2, still unresolved.

handle_multi() style shortcut redirect (fixed) would be
nice for other modules. For instance mod_dir()
would be much faster using such redirection.
Iff you trace calls for http://www.xxx/, you'll see, 
that mod_negotiation() is called twice for the same URI
due to standard redirect:
/ -> mod_dir() -> /Welcome.html -> handle_multi() -> select /Welcome.html.en ->
mod_dir() -> redirect -> /Welcome.html -> handle_multi() again!
This could be a serious performance hit.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Use redirection shortcut similar to the handle_multi():

State-Changed-Why:
Thank you for the report.  If this hasn't been fixed for
1.2 (I remember seeing some of your suggestions implemented,
but I don't know if this was one of them), it will have
to wait for a future release.  Report suspended for
future consideration.

[Some mis-directed mail from Dean that should have been
attached here.]

This could be suspended pending the implementation of a promte_request()
function.  We did a lot of cleanup around 1.2b8 with the request
promotion that handle_multi() uses (Petr Lampa pointed out most of the
bugs actually).

He also pointed out the inefficiency of mod_dir+negotiation in that both of
them do readdir()s on the same directory.  Caching would be really nice.

State-Changed-Why:

"We did a lot of cleanup around 1.2b8 with the request
promotion that handle_multi()"

And with that the bugs (vulnerabilities?) remained.  This
function has moved into the http_protocol.c core as an
internal_fast_redirect, but it's just as likely to be
deprecated if it is not maintained.  That code wasn't
resetting the uri, causing problems with query arguments.

Caching, throughout the server, is more likely to benefit
Apache 2.0.  Time will tell.  You are correct, that this
is a faster transition than an internal redirect, but it
bypasses some of the checkers to take advantage of some
assumptions that may not be safe.
