>Description:
when operating on a system with multiple virtual interfaces, it is necessary
to specify a host IP address for the running jserv otherwise all connections
are attempted against 127.0.0.1, which is typically not the correct process,
if it exists at all.  When a connection is started on an unnamed socket, the
O/S will (somewhat randomly) assign the source address for the connection from
the available virtual interfaces.  This makes it difficult to define the list
of acceptable hosts to the security.allowedAddresses property.

I realize it is possible to avoid the collision by running jserv on separate
ports for each http server instance.  However this requires an external port
allocation mechanism.  Such allocation is already well established via the
separate virtual interfaces.
>How-To-Repeat:
have a host with multiple virtual interfaces, run two independent apache servers
and try to get them to communicate with their respective jservs.
>Fix:
At line 102 in jserv_ajpv11.c, add:

   ret=bind(sock,(struct sockaddr *)&addr,sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));

This will set the source address to the target address, which should be
correct for all cases I can think of as the jserv is guaranteed to be running
on the local machine.  I guess you should also test the return value :-)

 Hello,
 
 I have tried adding that line and everything stopped working...the diff of
 the code change that I attempted is below. I do see the cannot bind to host
 error in my mod_jserv.log file.
 
 I really am not experienced with networking code in C so I'm not sure what
 is going wrong, I'm just trying to see if I can close this bug report.
 
 Any better ideas?

 I'll hack on this -- especially given somebody cares!  I'm not sure why
 this wouldn't work, it's probably something simple.

 Jon,
 
 I finally got a chance to examine this further.  I believe the problem
 is that "addr" here is specifying both the IP and the port, but we
 actually must only specify the IP address, as the port is guaranteed to
 be in use (by the JServ listener).
 
 So, instead of:
 
    ret=bind(sock,(struct sockaddr *)&addr,sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
 
 We really need something more like:
 
    {
 	struct sockaddr_in local = addr;
 	local.sin_port = htons(0);
 	ret=bind(sock,(struct sockaddr *)&local,sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
 	if (ret==-1) {
 	      .  .  .
 	}
    }
 
 I'd supply some actual diffs here, but it turns out there is a further
 complication.  As written, org.apache.jserv.JServ doesn't appear to
 have any way to listen on other than INADDR_ANY (aka 0.0.0.0).
 
 This means that you can't currently run more than one JServ on the same
 port but a different virtual interfaces.  So this gets to be much more
 like an enhancement than a bug fix.  As far as I can see, we'd need
 to:
 
 	- add a new property (say "host") so the listen address can
 	  be specified.
 
 	- change AuthenticatedServerSocket.java to use the 3 arg version
 	  of ServerSocket() if this property is specified, otherwise
 	  the current 2 arg version.
 
 As the whole point of the jserv_ajpv11.c change is to allow operation
 on specific addresses when a host runs multiple interfaces, the java
 changes would have to happen as well.
 
 I'm not sure what priority you guys place on this or if anyone else has
 run into this kind of thing.  Certainly it would make my life easier
 but I can achieve nearly the same thing by allocating separate ports
 for each JServ running on a virtual interface.
 
 I'm happy to help out but my java abilities are a good deal worse than
 my C abilities!

 Yep, the java portion of this issue has been open for some time now and I
 actually have patches that will fix the Java portion that someone else
 contributed. You have correctly identified all the issues regarding this
 (including adding the property to the jserv.properties file).
 
 This is all an issue that I do not think will make it into 1.0 at this
 point, but definately into 1.0.1. So, as soon as I get back from my vacation
 (two weeks from now), I will look into this further.
