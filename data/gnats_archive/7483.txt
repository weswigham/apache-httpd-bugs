>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
SuSE Linux 6.4, Gcc 2.95.2
IBM WebShere 3.5 Standard for Linux
ApacheJServ 1.1.2
>Description:
IBM made some modifications to the Apache Source to support SSL with their own ssl module. 

These modifications do not play well with JServ, since the JServ Code accesses
some internal variables which were modified by IBM.
>How-To-Repeat:
Get IBM HTTP Server from IBM, try to compile mod_jserv (1.1.2) for it. You will get compilation errors. 
>Fix:
The direct access to the internal variables should be replaced by proper calls to ap_* functions, which provide the needed functionality.

I could build a working jserv by making some changes to jserv_ajpv12.c

I replaced access to buff->fd_in with ap_bfileno(buff, B_RD).
Also I replaced one access to buff->fd (which looks like a hack to me) where buff->fd is set to -1. I think ap_bclose(buff) could do the job better.  

Here's a diff of the changes I made
