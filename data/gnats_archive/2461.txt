>Description:
src/helpers/GuessOS fails to get the correct system information due to the use of 
the non-standard "-X" option to uname.  The script generates several errors after which Configure
fails as well.
>How-To-Repeat:
make sure you have GNU uname in your path before /bin.
or for that matter just make sure you have an executable called uname somewhere in your
path before /bin/uname
>Fix:
There are two ways to solve that I can tell.  One is to use an explicit PATH setting in the
GuessOS script.

The other is to explicitly use "/bin/uname -X" instead of "uname -X" in the script.

I would suggest the 2nd one.

State-Changed-Why:
Please check with 1.3.4. If uname does not support -X, and most don't, this should be transparent. It behaves correctly on many platforms that do and don't support -X.

 GuessOS gives out a correct output in 1.3.4 on the PowerPC Linux
 platform.
