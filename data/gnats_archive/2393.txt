OSF1 V4.0 464 alpha
>Description:
if your webserver is running and you edit a conf file, inserting a mistake, then :
apachectl graceful cannot restart httpd but says it is restarted :(

www@ ~/http > restart [an alias for launching apachectl graceful]
/users/eleve/www/http/sbin/apachectl graceful: httpd gracefully restarted
and then
www@ ~/http > ps ux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TTY      S    STARTED         TIME COMMAND
www      24613  0.4  0.4 2.23M 480K ttyp2    S    17:50:03     0:00.64 -tcsh (t

=> no httpd running afterwards
>How-To-Repeat:
insert a mistake in any conf file (for example change Options in Pptions)
then launch apachectl graceful
>Fix:
either launch "twice" apachectl graceful (the second time will say "httpd not running"
and try to launch it unsuccessfully) when the user requests it once
or launch "apachectl start" after "apachectl graceful" so that the user
knows where the error is (cf. my example)
or (better) make the graceful "verbose" to explain the mistake
or tell apachectl graceful not to restart when there is a mistake in a conf file
(so that the web server doesn't stop until the webadmin fixes the error)

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: rse
State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 10 05:13:02 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is now fixed for 1.3.1: There are now "httpd -t" or
"apachectl configtest" commands which can be used
to check the configuration after a change for syntax
errors. Additionally the "apachectl restart" and
"apachectl graceful" commands now use "apachectl configtest"
theirself before initiating a restart. This way
Apache will no longer die on (usually automated by
cron) restarts because of a configuration
errors. Thanks for your report.
