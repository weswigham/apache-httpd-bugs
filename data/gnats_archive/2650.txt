>Environment:
# uname -a
UNIX_SV landfax1 4.2 1 i386 386/AT
Compiler is gcc 2.7.2
GuessOS returns whatever*whatever*unixware1
>Description:
I have just compiled 1.3.0 in the same environment as 1.2.4 which compiled OK.
Now 1.3.0 has the following problem: On starting httpd, the error_log file gets 
filled with heaps of errors and no pages can be retrieved:

[Tue Jul 21 12:28:43 1998] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket)
[Tue Jul 21 12:28:43 1998] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket)
[Tue Jul 21 12:28:43 1998] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket)
[Tue Jul 21 12:28:43 1998] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket)

I noticed that in the Configure script, the CFLAGS line under Unixware 1 OS has changed in 1.3.0 from 1.2.4.
1.2.4: CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DSVR4 -DNO_LINGCLOSE"
1.3.0: CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DUW=100"

I changed it back to the 1.2.4 version, recompiled and it works fine!

The OS version is a bit fuzzy. Its called Consensus Unix but it is (as I understand) a rebadged version of early Unixware.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build it. The Configure options I used were --prefix=/home/fqms/apache --enable-module=status.
>Fix:
See Full Description. I managed to work around it but it may not be a _good_ 
fix.
