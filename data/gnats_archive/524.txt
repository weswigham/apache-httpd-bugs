>Description:
I seem to have this directory that doesn't want to update.  When I load it,
I get a directory listing even though there's an index.html file in there
waiting to shown.  Furthermore, it's showing files that no longer exist
and not showing files I've added.  It always shows the first state of the
directory the first time I loaded it.
>How-To-Repeat:

Directory actually contains a folder called "filez" and two files, one called
index.html and one called list-warez.cgi.  You can get both of these files,
you cannut get the index.shtml file which the directory listing claims is there.
>Fix:
No, sorry.  Looks like it's caching the listing for some reason but I dunno

After discussion with the user this does not appear to be
an apache problem.
