>Description:
situation: one apache server running, installing latest version for upgrade.

After compiling apache and attempting to run for the first time, apache
complains because it is by default looking at my current servers config
files(/usr/local/etc/httpd/conf). 

although i'm aware there is a command-line option to tell apache where to find
config files. i think it would be better if apache looked first in a location
relative to the current directory. 

this would help out both upgraders who are testing the install in a tmp dir
and most importantly naive users who simply want to get apache up and running.

But unfortunately you also need to edit various pieces of
the config file.  So it doesn't really help to just look
relative to the current directory ...
