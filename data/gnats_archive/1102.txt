>Environment:
Win95, OSR2, IE4.0, VC 5.0, using Tcl8.0 for cgi script.
>Description:
When Apache starts up, its DOS window (and the start bar icon when minimized)
is named "APACHE". When a Tcl8.0 cgi script executes, the name is changed to
"tclsh80".

Clearly not serious, and it may be a problem with tcl rather than Apache,
but it is annoying.

State-Changed-Why:

There isn't much Apache can do about this problem, but
there are 'tray apps' available which let you
hide the DOS box completely.
