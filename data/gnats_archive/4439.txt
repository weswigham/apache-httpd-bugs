Debian 2.1; kernel:2.0.36; ApacheJServ 1.0b4; jdk 1.1.7; jsdk 2.0; SyBase with Jdbc 4.0,4.1
>Description:
When I execute a query servlet on a database (Sybase, located on an other PC), the database continue to send data even if I stop the browser.
In these conditions I cannot run any other query on database until the previous is done.
In case of multiple users connections, I get an "Out of Memory" error in the error_log of Apache, Apache stops and the database is locked.

>How-To-Repeat:
Try to make an heavy servlet query on a database and stop it before the end.After this try to execute another query servlet.
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-Why:
This is not an Apache JServ problem, this is a problem with the way that you have coded your servlet. You need to have a connection.close() call in the finally block of your doGet()/doPost() methods in the servlet. What is probably happening is that an exception is being thrown because the client has closed the connection and you are still trying to do out.print() statements on the outputstream. Thus, the connection.close() method is not being called and you are running out of open database connections.

In the future, please be more precise when filing bug reports. This is not a bug report in Apache JServ, it is a bug report in your servlet. If you would like more servlet help, I suggest that you subscribe to the servlet-interest@java.sun.com mailing list.

thanks,
