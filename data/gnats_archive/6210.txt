>Description:
When compiling C++ modules which import the Apache API (via httpd.h)
the referred include/alloc.h conflicts heavily with /usr/include/g++/alloc.h.

This produces severe inconsistencies: E.G. it ist not possible to combine
CORBA w/ Apache modules. 

We suggest renaming alloc.h into ap_alloc.h and correcting the files httpd.h, 
os/tpf/os.c, and a lot of Makefile.tmpl's.
>How-To-Repeat:

#include <httpd.h> // from the apache includes

#include <CORBA.h> // from MICO
>Fix:
see above
