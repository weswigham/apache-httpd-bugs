>Description:
In configuring JServ using "./configure --with-apache-dir=... --enable-apache-conf --prefix=... --with-jdk-home=...",
my Apache server configuration got blown away.  The correct way for JServ to configure
the server would have been to have it fork config.status with additional arguments,
not configure, and other arguments would have been maintained.		
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache with arguments to configure, then configure JServ with --enable-apache-conf.
>Fix:
have JServ config fork config.status with additional arguments, not configure
