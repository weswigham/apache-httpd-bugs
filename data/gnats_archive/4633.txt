I get this error when trying to run the Configure script. Is something missing ? I do not understand the error output.

** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration   
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler   
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such 
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler    
** will also provide a clue.                             
 Aborting!
