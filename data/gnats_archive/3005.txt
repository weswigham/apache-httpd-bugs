REdHat Linux Kernel 2.0.31 
>Description:
upgraded from 1.2.4 to 1.3.1 i run 5 virtual hosts and have found that if i 
use microsoft IE 3.0 OR 3.02 AND IE WITH AOL DISTRIBUTION. That it will bring
up my main website instead of the correct Virtual host. I have tested this with
IE 3.0, 3.01, and 3.02 all with the same results but if i use any Netscape
browser it transfers the virtual host site correctly..
Please Help..!
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, www.mythicalrealms.com is a virtual host site which should bring you up
to a page to find info on games and such but you will probably get the 
main website Safehaven.net or an error saying /cust.html not available

>Fix:
? No, Any suggestions would be very much appreciated..
