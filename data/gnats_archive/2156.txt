     Hello,
     
     I am hitting problem PR1558 as well.  I have an alias  /cdrom/ f:/
     and a <directory "f:/"> defined with default options
     and "allow from all".  If i point the alias to a valid directory 
     it works.
     
     Is there any fix for this yet?
     
     Thanks alot for your reply.
