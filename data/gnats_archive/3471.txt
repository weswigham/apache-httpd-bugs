>Description:
Our Apache intranet server is configured to serve 13 name based virtual hosts.
Upon accessing the first host a java applet is loaded from the root directory 
of that virtual server. Everything works fine.
Accessing another virtual server with another applet results in the following
error conditions:
1. the 2nd applet has the same name as the 1st one: the 1st one is loaded.
or
2. the 2nd applet has a different name and is not found. This will cause an
entry in the error log of the 1st server:
[Tue Dec  1 16:46:24 1998] [error] [client 10.200.181.17] File does not exist: /usr/local/apache/share/www.evs.iv/navigat2.class
(which is correct because the applet is located at /usr/local/apache/share/test.bonnerakademie/navigat2.class)

The problem seems to be browser independant, we successfully reproduced it with
Netscape Navigator 3.03, 4.05, 4.5 on Windows NT, MS IE 4 on NT 
and NS Navigator 4.5 on Linux.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create 2 name based virtual servers each with a document that contains a java
applet. Access both documents.
(unfortunately, no URL can be given because our intranet is not open to
public access)

State-Changed-Why:

This is a bug in the Java implementation on the browsers,
probably in the class loader.  You might try reporting it
to JavaSoft.

Thanks for the report in any case, since it might help other
users identify the same problem.
