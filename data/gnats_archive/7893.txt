this is a small fragment of the virtual host.

mod_usertrack seems to be working with http requests on existing files, but when you redirect request using mod_rewrite, or if request returns a 404 or other errors, the cookie is not set.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://pipelogtest.altlist.com/  - cookie works
http://pipelogtest.altlist.com/cgi-bin/enter.cgi?bla - does not work
>Fix:
not experienced enough with writing apache module,
but i guess there should be addheader function for apache modules, that will add header to a response headers table, then pass the request to next module...

right now the module just sends the cookie header, ... well i am just speculating, you guys have to look into it yourself.
