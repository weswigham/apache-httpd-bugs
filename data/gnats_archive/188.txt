>Environment:
QNX 4.23, watcom 10.6
>Description:
FNDELAY is not defined in the QNX environment, docs suggest that fnctl 
cannot be applied to sockets, ioctl() is suggested instead. 
#define FNDELAY O_NONBLOCK allows the build to complete, but I don't know if
the socket is actually set to non-blocking.
>How-To-Repeat:
build under qnx (or call me at (800) 888-7166
>Fix:
use ioctl%3
