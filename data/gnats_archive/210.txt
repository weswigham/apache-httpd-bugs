State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Feb 27 19:40:47 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Fixed in revision 1.44 of util.c, which will be available
in the next release.  Thanks for the report, it appears that
our conf.h has some trouble deciding if it use should
HAS_GMTOFF or HAVE_GMTOFF so that bit of code is never
actually compiled right now in the distribution.  That
will be fixed as well, but perhaps not before 1.2 to avoid
introducing problems.
