>Description:
I have a CGI that basically creates:
<HTML>
<FRAMESET COLS="%25,*">
  <FRAME SRC="tmp\a.HTML">
  <FRAME SRC="tmp\b.HTML">
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>
(It also creates the a.HTML and b.HTML too)
Apache believes that when tmp\a.HTML is requested that it should be executed 
rather than sent.

error.log:
[Mon Aug 24 21:12:00 1998] [error] d:/apache/cgi-bin/tmp/1270011099t.html is not executable; ensure interpreted scripts have "#!" first line

Notes:
The file is being created in the cgi-bin/tmp directory.

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... please read the docs on the ScriptAlias directive.
It tells Apache that all files in a directory are CGI
scripts, period.

If you want to configure Apache to only treat files with
certain names as CGI scripts, then fine you can do that
easily, but not with the ScriptAlias directive.

It would be quite broken if Apache tried to magically guess
that you are saying "oh, all files should be executable
except those that I guess this author doesn't want to be
even though he hasn't told me."

 Yes I understand this.
 
 I have the following setup:
 
 d:\Apache			executables
 d:\Apache\cgi-bin		CGI directory
 d:\Apache\root		Server root directory
 
 When a CGI is executed out of d:\Apache\cgi-bin directory and creates files
 (HTML to be used in <FRAMESET>), the refrenced URL is referenced from the
 CGI directory:
 
 <FRAME SRC="tmp/a.HTML">	becomes d:\Apache\cgi-bin\tmp\a.HTML
 [Mon Aug 24 21:06:21 1998] [error] d:/apache/cgi-bin/tmp/1270011096t.html is
 not executable; ensure interpreted scripts have "#!" first line
 [Mon Aug 24 21:06:21 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't
 spawn child process: d:/apache/cgi-bin/tmp/1270011096t.html
 
 <FRAME SRC="/tmp/a.HTML">	becomes d:\Apache\cgi-bin\\tmp\a.HTML.EXE
 [Mon Aug 24 21:01:05 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: script not
 found or unable to stat: d:/apache/cgi-bin/tmp/1270011093P.HTML.EXE
 
 How do I dynamically create an HTML from a CGI that won't be intrepreted as
 being a CGI (executable)?

 Put it in a directory that you haven't told Apache is a CGI directory!
 
 eg. ../somedir
 
 As we try to state very clearly, the bugdb is _NOT_ for user support
 questions, but is only for things that you have reason to know are bugs or
 you have already posted to Usenet, etc. without a response.
