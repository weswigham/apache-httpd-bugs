Apache 1.3.12 with mod_ssl 2.6.5-1.3.12 and jserv 1.1.2
Java 1.3 and JSDK 2.0	
>Description:
If I build mod_rewrite into Apache, I see the .o being created and I see 
mod_rewrite being added to the library file.  But when attempting to start the
web server, even a simple "RewriteEngine on" statement on the httpd.conf will 
cause an "Invalid command RewriteEngine", as if it was not recognized and the 
server fails to start.  If I put the RewriteEngine command inside an <IfModule
mod_rewrite.c> statement or in a .htaccess file, it just ignores it.  Same goes 
for any other mod_rewrite commands.  The results seemed to be the same if I used
the ./configure approach or if I went to src/Configuration and enabled the 
AddModule statement.

If I build mod_rewrite as a .so file (which I have to manually deploy to the 
libexec directory and then include with a LoadModule statement, I get a different
error telling me that it cannot load it because it doesn't find dbm_fetch().  I 
searched through all the code and could not find any source file with the 
dbm_fetch() function.
>How-To-Repeat:
You may access this server (with the non-functioning mod_rewrite) at 
http://kestrel.theelab.com.  Note: this server is being worked on, so it might
go up and down at any time.
>Fix:
No idea.  But would appreciate a message if you find a solution.  I expect this 
is probably a bug introduced in 1.3.12 or you would have heard about it already.
I found no references to this problem anywhere in the docs, faq, nor in the
bug archives.

As a separate recommendation, I would suggest adding an "installation" section to
the mod_rewrite users guide, perhaps even including some instructions for some
simple testing and debugging.
