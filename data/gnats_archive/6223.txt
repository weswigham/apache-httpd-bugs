>Environment:
SunOS bilbo 5.7 Generic_106541-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
gcc 2.95.2
>Description:
See example:

- When 'NoProxy .foo.com' is active (no proxy chaining), rewriting works ok.
- When 'NoProxy .foo.com' is unactive (proxy chaining), http rewriting works,
  but CONNECT not (Apache sends 'CONNECT a.foo.com:443 HTTP/1.0' intead of
  'CONNECT b.foo.com:443 HTTP/1.0' to the next proxy.
>How-To-Repeat:
   ProxyRequests    On
   ProxyRemote      * http://proxy.foo.com:8080
   ##NoProxy        .foo.com

   <Directory proxy:*>
      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteRule   ^proxy:a.foo.com:443    proxy:b.foo.com:443    [L]
      RewriteRule   ^proxy:http://a.foo.com proxy:http://b.foo.com [L]
   </Directory>
