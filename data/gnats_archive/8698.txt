>Description:
As the doc says, the .htpasswd file needs to be defined with full path,
otherwise it is searched in ServerRoot directory. We are using apache
for providing users webspace and do not wans to tell them either full path
nor give the access to any other directory then their DocumentRoot.
They can upload .htaccess file but they can't upload .htpasswd file anyway
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
the AuthUser(DB,DBM)File defined in .htaccess should be imo searched in
the same directory as .htaccess. OF course i know security considerations,
but I think directive <Files> could be used to prevent access to that file
for users.

State-Changed-Why:
While you may not "want to" give them access to any non-web accessible directory to store sensitive information that shouldn't be accessible via HTTP requests, that doesn't change the fact that storing them inside the document tree is a poor idea and, while Apache doesn't stop you from doing it, it is NOT appropriate for Apache to make that the easiest thing to do by defaulting to loading the file from the same directory as the .htaccess file containing the auth directive.
