(This report supercedes PR #1111 was was accidentally submitted before it was completed - sorry)

When a completely empty request is received by Apache, log entries in both
access_log and error_log (in default configuration - it will affect any logging of the RequestLine) contain "rubbish" data - typically lots of character &FF data., although the data that is written will be OS dependent.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use 'telnet' to connect to the Apache server.  Once conected hit the intr key (^C usually).  Connection will close, both error_log & access_log will then contain the unexpected data
>Fix:
Trap these empty requests in the logging module to prevent that data being written to the log file, although it may be the case that it should be handled elsewhere if the logging modules is not the only one that assumes the request line was valid

State-Changed-Why:
I don't see this being Apache's fault at all.  What
I see in my log (non-printing characters translated, of
course) is "0xff0xf40xff0xfd^F".  0xff is the telnet
IAC (interpret as command) prefix, then 0xf4 is the
interrupt process command.  You will probably find
the rest are of a similar nature.  telnet does not
do a raw TCP connection; when you hit ^C in it, it actually
sends that to Apache.
