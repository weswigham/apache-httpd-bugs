>Description:
The new virtual-host log messages about <VirtualHost> overlaps
are great and a wonderful debugging tool, but there are two
problems with it:

1. They get reported so early in the config parsing that they
   come out on stderr - so they never appear in the ErrorLog
   for later reference.  Having to restart the server to reproduce
   them is not a very good option.

2. If there are problems with my name-vhosts, and they're defined
   using <VirtualHost n.n.n.n>, the messages complain strictly about
   the n.n.n.n identity.  If all my <VirtualHost> containers use that
   syntax, there's no way to tell which ones are having problems.
   The log message should include the value from ServerName directive
   inside the <VirtualHost> container, or some other way of identifying
   which ones have problems.

You're welcome for my using Apache. <g>

 You'd have to open the error_log after the first round of config parsing. 
 This would be a cool thing, I've no idea what bad effects it would have.

 It could include the filename:line_number ... well there's a bug in the
 calculation of those, I've got a patch for it somewhere. 
 
 It should also mention that "NameVirtualHost" might be needed.

State-Changed-Why:
Is this still true?  We tweaked the error log stuff so one
report should go to the error log... and martin fixed the
source file line numbering thing... so the only thing left is
a small tweak to the error message generated for vhost overlap.
Right?
