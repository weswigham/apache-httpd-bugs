>Description:
Release 1.3.17 of Apache was announced but the binaries for win32
don't seem to be available. In the past the binaries were always there
when I got the announcement of a new release so I thought I'd better
check if something was wrong. Will the binaries be made available soon?
Thanks much.

State-Changed-When: Sat Feb  3 16:45:16 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:

One, forgive the slow platform maintainer who has a day job.

Two, the installer was revamped to Microsoft Installer .msi
packaging, so the pre-testing took some days.

Please check the comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
newsfeed in the future, as there was a discussion and offer
to 'preview' the new installer before it's general release.

In any case, that installer is now available.

Thanks for using apache!
