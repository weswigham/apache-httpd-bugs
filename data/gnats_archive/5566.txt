>Description:
Using apachectl as a startup script (with a link from /sbin/rc3.d/S99apache
to /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl for instance) on HP-UX displays garbage at
boot and shutdown.

HP-UX startup an shutdown scripts use "<rc script> start_msg" and
"<rc script> stop_msg" to create a fancy display of starting and stopping
daemons. Doing this with apachectl displays the usage error message instead.

Of course, maybe we should use an intermediate rc script rather than messing
with apachectl to work around such OS peculiarities... 
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The following patch or something similar should do.
