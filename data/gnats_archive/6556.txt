>Description:
The documentation for mod_log_config incorrectly states that the format
for Common Log Format includes %s when it actually includes %>s.  The
default format string, which happens to be CLF, is also incorrectly
documented.  The documentation was not updated at the same time as the
source code when the default format string was changed from %s to %>s to
log CLF correctly (mod_log_config.c version 1.18).  This error should
be fixed in both 1.3 and 2.0.

 <P>
 
 Note that the common log format is defined by the string <CODE>"%h %l
-%u %t \"%r\" %s %b"</CODE>, which can be used as the basis for
+%u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b"</CODE>, which can be used as the basis for
 extending for format if desired (<EM>e.g.</EM>, to add extra fields at the end).
-NCSA's extended/combined log format would be <CODE>"%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""</CODE>.
+NCSA's extended/combined log format would be <CODE>"%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""</CODE>.
