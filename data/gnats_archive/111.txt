>Description:
The command 'ProxyBlock' mentioned in the documentation for the proxy_module causes
an error which prevents the httpd from starting up. The error is:

# Syntax error on line 148 of /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command ProxyBlock

My config file is set up as follows for that command:

# Block certain keywords from access - (apparently we're not running 1.2 - it 
#   doesn't like this directive)
#
ProxyBlock FIDO

State-Changed-Why:
Are you sure you have the proxy module compiled in?  Did you
uncomment it in Configuration and run Configure then 
rebuild?  Does a 'httpd -h' list the ProxyBlock command?

State-Changed-Why:
ProxyBlock is not in 1.2b4, but will be in 1.2b5; our 
method of handling documentation on the web just has 
some gaps.
