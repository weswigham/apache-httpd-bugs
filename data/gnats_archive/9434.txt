>Description:
I had tried to install an Oracle evaluation copy on my system however the person who gave me the CD gave me a copy for Windows 98.  The download bombed half way through but there was no means to uninstall.  I am now trying to install IIS on my computer but it doesn't work because the Apache server is there but it will not allow me to delete it....it says it is in use.  Please instruct me how to remove Apache.  I really do not want to format my hard drive and reload everything.
Thank you,
Eric Lange

State-Changed-Why:

Since you got the software from Oracle, you should contact
Oracle for information on how to get rid of it.  We can
only guess at what they have done.

A couple guesses:

1. Apache should appear in the "Add/Remove Program"
window of the control panel.

2. You can go to the "Services" manager and tell Apache
not to start at boot.

Beyond that, please ask Oracle.
