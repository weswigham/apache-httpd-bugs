You haven't really identified a specific bug in Apache.
You just have something you are trying that doesn't work.
The best place to address problems like this is the
PHP users mailing list or the HTTP Server users mailing
list.

If you can clearly identify a specific bug in Apache,
please let us know.

Thanks for using Apache!
