Linux kernels 2.2.1 , 2.2.2. Double Pentium II 400Mhz, gcc 2.7.2.3 , PHP 3, MySQL
Installation RedHat 5.2
>Description:
Well,
We are running huge database. After installing new kernels , everything seemed
to be OK, but in critical hours, when the traffic is very high, apache simply
'fell' down. He(?:) didn't answer, but there were about 80 httpds running, kernel
said 'waiting'. We tried to telnet on port 80, but 'connection timed out'.
MaxAllowed was 256, but no other apaches were forked. In kernel 2.0.36 is
everything OK. (or should I report this to kernel-bugs?)
Sorry for my English... :(
>How-To-Repeat:
Eh, we can't provide you repeatment, 'cos we are quite small firm with  lot
of customers providing them free-email. Look at: http://www.email.cz
And this is very critical section of our business.
>Fix:
It seems to me, that kernel doesn't want to fork another httpd. _Very_ strange.

Comment-Added:
It's possible that you were running into a kernel limit of some sort, most likely the max # of open files. What is your setting for that?

State-Changed-Why:
2.2.1 and 2.2.2 weren't stable... try 2.2.6, or stay with
2.0.36 until the 2.2.x series stabilizes.  Given that 2.0.36
doesn't have this problem it's unlikely that it's an apache
specific problem, so you could report it to the linux-kernel
mailing list.
