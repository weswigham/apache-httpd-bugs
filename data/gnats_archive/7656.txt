SunOS 5.8
>Description:
I use Apache 1.3.19 with Tomcat 3.2
When I try to upload a binary file with a 'FF' byte, it returns a 500 code.
In Apache logs, I got this :

in acces.log
194.7.65.65 - - [30/Apr/2001:11:42:46 +0200] "POST /attachFiles.do HTTP/1.1" 200 3489
194.7.65.65 - - [30/Apr/2001:11:42:46 +0200] "3À3Éº" 501 -

in error.log
[Mon Apr 30 11:42:46 2001] [error] [client 194.7.65.65] Invalid method in request 3À3Éº

I uploaded a binary file with a POST and multipart/form-data as enctype.
The string 3À3Éº is present in the file.
Each time I try to upload the file, I got the same string
If I try to upload another file, I got another string (always the same). Index of strings in the files have nothing in common.

It is a problem related to Apache because if I try to upload files directly to Tomcat with the 8080 port, everything is working correctly.

The clients we tried were IE5.5, IE5.0, IE6.0. Each time the same problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well, as the production machine is alive, I changed the upload target to use the 8080 port to shortcut Apache, so I have no exq,ple URL
>Fix:
I had a 'similar' (?) problem in a previous application while using an old version of oreilly's MultipartRequest class. There were uploads problems with IE5 and higher. Maybe the problem here is related to this one. Now the latest version of MultipartRequest class is working fine with any browser. If the two problems are related, applying the same fixes should solve it.
