>Description:
 Via CustomLog/TransferLog it's possible to log to a
 program instead of a file (eg. TranferLog |/bin/foobar).

 If the logging program is alive and working there is no
 problem, but when the logging program crashed or had been
 killed Apache becauses unusable.
 Requests are accepted, but immediately after the client
 send the request the connection is closed.
 In the error log the following entry appears on every request:
 "request lost connection to client <foobar>"

 My question is now... Is it possible to handle such a case,
 eg. to disable the logging funcionality, but still serve requests?


 (By the way, is there a reason why the logging program has to be
 run under the id of the user who started Apache (eg. root)?)
>How-To-Repeat:
 Here's a minimal version of the script I used for testing:

   #!/bin/sh
   LOGFILE=/usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/badreferer.log
   while /bin/true;
   do
     read l
     if [ `echo "$l" | grep -c '\-$'` = 0 ];
     then
       echo "$l" >> $LOGFILE &
     fi
   done

 Configuration:
 
   CustomLog |/usr/local/etc/httpd/sbin/reflog.sh "%t %U %{Referer}i"

State-Changed-Why:
This is a feature that won't make 1.2.  But the solution I
like is to deal with a blocked write, and possibly
a dead child, and recover by doing a graceful restart so that
we can re-open the log child.
