Someone tried this:
"GET /cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd" 302 -
I got this from the access_log, the error_log shows it failed (client denied by server configuration)
so... is this a security problem? 
when i did the same thing (from a workstation on the same network, i got jetted to
a cgi script on phf.apache.org....
saying im on candid camera~!

State-Changed-Why:
phf is a common script that had a security hole in it that
allowed anyone to execute arbitrary commands.  It is not
distributed with Apache, but you must have uncommented
a line in your config file designed to redirect such
requests to a script at phf.apache.org that simply logs the
request.

 There is no generic way to test for all such ways you could blast a nasty
 security hole into your server.
 
 The very fact that your system is doing nothing but redirect queries for
 this particular program shows that you have nothing to worry about from
 the phf program.
