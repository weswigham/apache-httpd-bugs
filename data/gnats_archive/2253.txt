have you compiled on solaris 2.6 before, (since it now uses some 64bit io) ?
i have successfully compiled 1.3b5 w/ 2.5, makes me wonder, have i gone too far?

State-Changed-Why:
Um, it looks like you have a serious compiler problem there.
You have GCC header files co-mingling with OS header files
and giving each other grief.  I can't see anything in that
error report that points a finger at code in Apache.

I know Apache 1.3b6 and others have been compiled on Solaris
2.6....

Have you compiled (not just installed from CD, but compiled)
any other large or medium-sized packages?

 problem solved: needed to upgrade from GNUgcc.2.7.2 to GNUgcc.2.8.1 for
 solaris 2.6.
 that worked perfectly.  so sorry to have wasted your time.
 please close this ticket.
