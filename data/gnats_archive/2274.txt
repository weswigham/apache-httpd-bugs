>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP3, MSVC++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
The PATH_INFO environment variable is broken on Win32 systems.  If a CGI script is called with http://hostname/script.cgi/pathinfo/, the trailing slash is stripped from the PATH_INFO environment variable.  If the PATH_INFO contains a double slash, such as http://hostname/script.cgi/path//info, the double slash will be stripped.  These slashes are not stripped on Unix systems, and they shouldn't be.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try this cgi script on a Win32 Apache:
#!perl.exe -w

print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
print $ENV{'PATH_INFO'};
>Fix:
I'm guessing that there is some kind of slash translation going on with Win32 Apache, but I haven't been able to nail it down in the source.  Will let you know if I find it.
