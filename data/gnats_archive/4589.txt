you need to setup your ld_library_path correctly and make sure that that env variable is being passed properly to the JVM process. the faq has more details about the USL error. <http://java.apache.org/faq/>

 So are you saying that LD_LIBRARY_PATH *must* be used with jServ,
 and that java.lang.System.load (String pathname) is non functional?

 I'm saying that what you are doing is not working and that you should try
 using LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead.
