>Description:
I was trying to hack my box (just to see if/how others could), and I found
a very big, and dangerous flaw...
I had a logfiles directory for every user where they had all the standard
Apache logs...
>How-To-Repeat:
ln -s /etc/passwd TransferLog
I went and rehashed httpd (as root, sooner or later, all admins rehash webservers)
killall -HUP httpd
and, voila, I (as a regular user) now had write access to /etc/passwd
you cant control what gets written, but, it is still very dangerous...
>Fix:
I also found a temporary fix, but I think there should be an option in
apache where you control what user writes the logfile...
I compiled the "rotatelogs" program (its in one of the apache source
subdirs), and put it in /usr/bin
I added a "htlogd" user, and chown'd the file to htlogd.htlogd, and made
it suid, so it executes as user htlogd
adduser htlogd ; chown htlogd.htlogd rotatelogs ; chmod 4700 rotatelogs
I made all of the logfiles dirs owned by htlogd, and I changed all of the
logfile lines in httpd.conf in this fasion:
BEFORE
---
TransferLog "/home/website.com/logfiles/TransferLog"
AFTER
---
TransferLog "|rotatelogs /home/website.com/logfiles/TransferLog 86400"

It is a fairly good temporary fix...

 Note that this is not a bug and is well known and documented explicitly.
 
 I'm not sure that adding an option to have the logfiles written by a
 different user helps that much because the people who don't read the docs
 won't know about this open either.
