>Description:
At high loads about 40megabits of outbound HTTP connections. Running with NO keepalives the apache server began serving broken images. With keepalives ENABLED this problem was fixed but the load average jumped to 100+ at times. The following values were used:
Timeout 8
KeepAlive Off
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
KeepAliveTimeout 1
MinSpareServers 250
ExtendedStatus On
MaxSpareServers 350
StartServers 500
MaxClients 1750
MaxRequestsPerChild 700
Port 80

There were about 1000 servers in use, without 200 free and broken images about 10% of the time. I checked the BSD end and it all worked fine. I had enough file descriptors iostat, enough sockets, and enough nmbufs. Top showed 0 swap in use and about 100 megs of RAM free.
2 x pIII - 866
1GiG RAM

No error messages in /var/log/messages nor in /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log
