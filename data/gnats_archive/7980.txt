apache
>Environment:
The environment is a SuSe Linux 7.0 Operative System. The Web Server Apache v.1.3.12, and the data is in a Informix Data Base. 
>Description:
I have problems testing an informix application and working in the environment described above. The problem comes when an html page sends the fields of a form, because it should send only those fields have any value, but I can see that the web server get this fields with a null value after the submit operation.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The application web works well in Windows Nt with iPlanet (Netscape) as Web Server, so I have no idea what´s wrong.
