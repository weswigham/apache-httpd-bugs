>Description:
hi, i have read all the information re spam etc. My problem is this, i continually receive unsolicited offers from an alleged non profit org offering debt consolidation. Have searched the Reg users database to no avail. It has a'remove link' which doesn't work[ http://63.165.130.9/d6k/remove ] and when i get to 63.165.130.9[which supposedly doesn't exist] is has unreadable info, apache logo, and a link to your index, which also doesn't work properly.It appears that it may be one of your foundations project? HOW do i get off, i received a response from your org recntly that listed 'removal' sites, but they have had no effect From: <info@online-direct-advantage.com>
