>Description:
Hi, I just submitted a bug report including the string handling in
suexec. Well, this has changed in 1.2b4, but is still bugous.
The strings dwd and cwd are freeded although they are not pointers
which have been allocated by malloc, but simple auto variables!
This results in "undefined behaviour", which may mean crash.
It's absolutely illegal to call free() with a variable if that
kind.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
simply delete all occurences of free() in suexec.
