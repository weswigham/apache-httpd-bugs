The above program supposed to print out the names of all the loaded servlets.
But the result turned out those servlets of no aliases defined were missing.


>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
If a servlet has no alias defined, its fully-qualified class name should
be used instead.

State-Changed-Why:
Returning names for different servlets (rather than their aliases) would mean going down to the classloader
and checking if any loadable class extends the Servlet interface. For obvious performance reasons this is
not a possible thing to do.
Also, spec says that that method "Returns an enumeration of the Servlet object names in this server. Only
servlets that are accessible (i.e., from the same namespace) will be returned." Our namespace is defined
as the different specified aliases names.
Anyhow note that all methods relative to servlet chaining are deprecated in future releases of the Servlet
specs, and their use should be avoided.
