>Description:
When i fire up apache it comes up in a window and shows 
Apache/1.3.19(win32) PHP /4.0.5 running....

Which seems fine. However If i try to run Ie5 nothing happens.  When i then close apache ie5 will automatically fire up and go to my home site. 

On installation the dirs \usr\mibs and sapi where not created. 

I am sure that it is a simple problem but i dont get any error messages to help me to locate the problem.
