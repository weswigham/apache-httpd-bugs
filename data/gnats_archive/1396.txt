Does anything show up in the error log?

Are you just running one copy of the program, or one for
each virtual host?  Do you have seperate logfiles for
each virtual host?  ie. is it possible you are running
into file descriptor limitations?

 Marc,
 
 There is one transferlog statement which is outside any virtual host 
 definition; There should only be one invocation of the program.
 
 There is nothing in the error log. 
 
 This is the same problem I posted to Usenet last week and mailed to you
 twice. 
 
 I never did receive any e-mail on this and had to go back to the Apache 
 site to get the report below. 
 
 I don't suspect problems with my e-mail (I receive tons of it daily)
 however, if you have tried to respond to me, and that did not work,
 steve@iptopia.net, steve@netlynx.com, and steve@iptopia.com also work. 
 
 As a web hosting provider I need the ability to make log file data available
 to my customers. I need to do this in a secure fashion. If this cannot be
 done, then I need a different server solution.
 
 Cheers,
 Steve

 I posted this to my news server but am not entirely confident it gets
 propagated to the net very well. So, here goes: 
 
 This is using Apache 1.2.4 with mod_log_config under Solaris 2.5.1:
 
 
 I added/modified the following lines in my httpd.config file:
 
 TransferLog "|/usr/local/bin/logpipe <args>"
 LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b"
 
 Then wrote a program (logpipe_ which reads the log input on stdin, writes
 all of it to a "master" file. Each record's first field (as the format above
 specifies) is the ip address of the virtual server being logged.
 
 At 5 minute intervals I write each virtual host's log data to a separate
 file. Once this operation is completed I save the file position of the
 master log, to be used to reposition the file at the next 5 minute write.
 This allows me to provide timely log data to customers at the same time
 allowing them to manipulate these files without breeching security or
 disturbing the server (since each virtual hosts' log is only opened when
 written to.)
 
 I hope this is enough background :)
 
 My problem, here, is that server does not seem to be able to serve pages
 properly when logging to this program via pipe. Some servers seem OK,
 others simply result in the browser griping about "Document contains no
 data"
 
 
 Is this, again, a resource limitation issue?
 Do I need larger buffering on the pipe (and can setvbuf handle this or
 do I need some sort of ioctl?)
 
 Do I need to fork() when I go to write the virtual server logs (thereby
 freeing up time for the pipe program.)
 
 The logic to read the data from the pipe and store it in a file is fairly
 simple:
 
    while(fgets(buf,1024,stdin))  {
       fputs(buf,s);
       fflush(s);
    }
 
 The five minute event is fired via SIGALRM by calling alarm(300).
 The problems I run in to are seen before the first SIGALARM signal is 
 received.
 
 When the SIGALARM *is* fired I do something like
 
 fseek(s,last,SEEK_SET);
 while(fgets(buf,size,s) 
 	writeLog(buf);
 
 writeLog: 
 	vhost = getFileNameForVhost(buf)	// derive file name from 
 						// vhost id in log data
 	if((f=fopen(vhost,"a+")) != NULL) {
 		fputs(buf,f);
 		fclose(f);
 	}
 
 This is somewhat simplified but covers the basics. 
 
 If neccessary I can provide source to this beastie; My intent though is
 not to throw mycode up to the net and say "Here, debug this for me" -- I
 would rather have a firm(er?) understanding of what's going on. :)
 
 One final note: This works with the same web server configuration on my
 linux box, however, my linux box sits on a lan at my house with a 28.8k
 connection to the net so I do not get the same sort of traffic to the
 servers; It's not 
 a good real world test case. 
 
 Any thoughts are appreciated.
 
 Cheers,
 Steve

 Does this problem always happen right away after starting the 
 server?
 
 How many copies of your process does ps show running?
 
 If you try the simplest possible setup (eg. a perl script that
 does something like:
 
 	#!/usr/local/bin/perl
 	open (FILE, ">>/tmp/log.out") || die "blarg";
 	while (<>) {
 		print FILE;
 	}
 
 ) does it still have problems?  We need to eliminate your code as 
 being the problem.
 
 If the above is still a problem, how about when you don't have any
 virtual hosts?
 
 What state does ps show your logging process to be in at that time?
 If you compile it with debugging and try running gdb on it after
 it starts having problems, does it show it blocking on anything?
 
 You may want to try 1.3b3 when it comes out, because it has better piped
 logging support.  I suspect, however, that there is something else
 going on here.
 
 Do you have any other logfiles for each vhost?  Grab lsof from somewhere
 and see how many file descriptors each httpd process has open.

 Are you really sure you aren't running into file descriptor problems?  
 
 Have you tried reducing the number of virtual hosts?  Perhaps setup a test
 server on another port to play with and see if it happens with no virtual
 hosts, then add vhosts a bit at a time and see if it happens.

 The problems start happening within a minute or so from starting the
 server. The problems affect some virtual hosts in an unpredictable
 fashion.  I.e., I cannot predict which server will show problems and 
 cannot reliably get the same results with the same virtual host, although
 it will show up with other virtual hosts.

 ps shows one copy of my process.

 The above produces the same problems. Additionally the perl script above 
 does not actually write anything to /tmp/log.out -- The file is created,
 it is not written to.

 ps shows the process as sleeping (state=S). GDB will not run as it does not
 like some of Sun's shared libraries.

 Each vhost in the problematic configuration has an error log and a referer
 log. 
 
 I can send you my httpd.conf if needed. This is confidential, however, as
 it, in effect, contains a list of our customers. 
 
 Thanks

This is almost certainly a problem with whatever logging program
you're using.  I've seen it before where the logging program will
block, forever, in some cases... such as disk full.  Apache blocks
when this happens.  There's nothing we can do about it.

If you can produce a small reproduceable example which you can
send to us, then please do.  But without that we can't really
help, sorry!

Thanks for using Apache!
