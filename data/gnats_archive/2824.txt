Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
>Description:
All CGI scripts terminate with the following error in ERROR.LOG: "[Sun Aug 09 18:30:40 1998] [error] Premature end of script headers: e:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/environ.pl"
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The install program installs Apache in x:/program files/apache group/apache/... This causes errors with some PERL compilers when running scripts. If Apache is installed in a directory which conforms to a POSIX name, i.e. x:/apache/, the problem is fixed.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 11 00:51:17 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
There is a known problem with improper escaping of the
name passed in 1.3.1, meaning that paths with spaces
in won't work properly all the time.

This has been fixed, and the fix will be available in 1.3.2

Thanks for the report.
