>Description:
A CGI script that uses <PRE> to speed up response to browser does not work
because Apache seems to buffer the entire output before sending lines to
the browser.
This fails for the Windows version of Apache.  The Linux version does not have
this problem.

>How-To-Repeat:
The following CGI script works fine under Linux, where one line is displayed
each second.  It fails under Windows.  Nothing is displayed until the whole
10 seconds elapsed.
------file test.cgi-----------------
#!/perl/bin/perl -I /perl/lib

use CGI;
$cgi = new CGI;
$| = 1;

print $cgi->start_html;
print '<PRE>', "\n";
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++)
{
    if ($i > 1)
    {
       sleep (1);
    }
    print "This is line $i\n";
}
print '</PRE>', "\n";
print $cgi->end_html;
>Fix:
No.
