FreeBSD asuka.naviservers.net 4.4-STABLE FreeBSD 4.4-STABLE #0: Mon Mar 11 01:53:21 JST 2002     wmoring@asuka.naviservers.net:/usr/src/sys/compile/WEBSERVER_LX  i386
IE Version 6.026
>Description:
If i put a custom errordocument directive in place and it goes to a page with
a META-REFRESH Tag it will work once in IE.  IF any other Machine tries to 
access they get 404 error.  If i change the ERROR page to another without a 
META tag it works all day long.  i put the tag in place, send a friend there
it works once for him and not for anyone else.
  THe whole time Netscape works flawlessly.......any ideas?
>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunatly you will need to try it on your machine.
>Fix:
Im going to try and recreate it on an older version of apache.
  I believe it worked prior to the last apache upgrade.

State-Changed-Why:

This is almost certainly a client problem, not a server bug.
It probably has to do with the IE "friendly" error message.
Try turning those off.

Thanks for using Apache.
