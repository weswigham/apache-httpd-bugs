>Description:
  In src/os/unix/os-aix-dso.c , dlerror() is declared as const char * . But in
/usr/include/dlfcn.h it's only char * . These conflicting declarations make the
compilation fail.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
#ifdef AIX_DUMMY_DLERROR
 char * dlerror(void)
#else
 const char dlerror(void)
#endif

or something like that :)
