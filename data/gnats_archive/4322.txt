 PR 4322 and 1296 are not Apache bugs (they are user errors!).
 
 I had this problem (these problems) on my Solaris 2.7 box.  I had used =
 GNUTAR to move the system to a new disk and extraced it with a command =
 like:
 
 gtar -xf  files.tar
 
 
 When I booted off the new disks I had the following error in the apache =
 error_log
 
 [error] (13)Permission denied: accept: (client socket)
 
 and received the following when I tried to telnet to the port (80):
 
 telnet localhost 80
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 Connected to localhost.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 SetSockOpt: Invalid argument
 Connection closed by foreign host.     =20
 
 The apache server that serviced the request would be killed off and =
 another one spawned, with the exact same problem.
 
 The answer is to extract the files from the tar file correctly (with =
 PERMISSIONS!) like this:
 
 gtar -xpf  files.tar
 
 (with p being the important item).  =20
 
 Hopefully my mistake extracdting the system can help clear these issues =
 off the "bug" list and save someone else a bit of time!

Hi

I am having a problem with Apache 1.3.4 and Solaris 2.5.1. I have the latest
patches for 2.5.1 and have the exact same problem as PR#1296 from Oct of 1997.
The server suddenly stopped responding to http requests and records a
"permission denied: Accept: (client socket)" error whenever someone tries to
access the server. The child httpd web processes are continually dying and
respawning. We've tried everything similar to what the customer did in PR1296
with no success. Can you shed any light on this? The resolution on 1296 was very
vague or did not have an explanation at all.
