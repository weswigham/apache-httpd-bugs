AIX 4.3.2
IBM Visual Age C Compiler
>Description:
In trying to generate a 64 bit version of Apache with DSO support, it was
found that the original "do it yourself" code [in os-aix-dso.c] does not
work with a 64 bit build of Apache. To work around this, I had to either
fix the supplied code, or get Apache to use real AIX dlopen... etc.
I chose the latter.

The fix ented up being quite simple really. See below.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
In src/os/unix/os.h
/*
 * Do not use native AIX DSO support (Only for AIX 4.1 and below)
 */
#if AIX <= 41
#undef HAVE_DLFCN_H
#endif

In src/os/unix/os.c

/*
 * Insert the DSO emulation code for AIX (Only for AIX 4.1 and below)
 */
#if AIX <= 41
#include "os-aix-dso.c"
#endif

And the most important bit:


In src/support/httpd.exp:

Change the first line of httpd.exp from:

#!

to:

#! .

And bingo, you have have a 64 bit, native DSO support enabled version of Apache.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Mon Dec  3 05:58:56 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
This has subsequently been put in Apache (quite a few 1.3 "dot" releases ago).  Note that we use native dlopen() for 4.3 and above, not 4.2 and above like you suggested.
The fix for the first line to httpd.exp is committed as well.
