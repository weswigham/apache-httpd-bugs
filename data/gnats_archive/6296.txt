>Description:
When the path to my cgi-bin directory uses long filenames
(more than 8.3), Apache is unable to execute my CGI programs
(.exe files) properly.  Renaming the directories to 8.3 format
allows the CGI's to run properly.

 BTW, this problem occurs with any CGI program (even a
 simple "Hello World" CGI program) compiled with the DJGPP port of gcc,
 but does NOT seem to happen when testing with CGI's compiled with some
 other compiler (such as the "testcgi" program that comes with the Xitami
 web server).  But these
 same DJGPP-compiled CGI's work fine under the Xitami -
 even with the long pathnames in the CGI directory.

State-Changed-Why:

Please provide some example names.  Spaces and other 
reserved characters may not be valid in the context of a
cgi request.  I cannot duplicate your issue with any
straightforward requests, e.g. 

GET /cgi-bin/test-cgi-names.bat HTTP/1.0

works just fine for me.
