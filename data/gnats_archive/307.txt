>Environment:
Linux 1.2.13
Gcc 2.6.3
apache 1.1.1
>Description:
We run serveral virtual servers on a single machine. Each VS has its own log
file. Some(!) entrys in the log files form one VS are logged into the logfile
of a differend VS.
Each Server has its own IP-adress and its own "htdocs"-directory.
I know that 1.1.1 ist the lastest version but the doc told me that only
security fixes are made.

Is his a known bug of 1.1.1 ? I haven't found any comments about this in the
documenation.

State-Changed-Why:
A few bugs related to this were fixed in 1.2.  It's also possible
that you've got a problem with hosts overlapping the ip address
of the main server (i.e. the address of the server box itself).
At any rate, you'll have to try 1.2 since we no longer support
1.1.

Thanks for using Apache!
