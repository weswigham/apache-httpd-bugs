>Environment:
Linux, Redhat (mixed), gcc.
>Description:
The install-include target does not copy over os-inline.c to the install area. Modules compiled external the Apache source tree (via apxs in my case) will then fail when including os.h (which attempts to include os-inline.c on some platforms).
>How-To-Repeat:
Build a module outside of the main tree using apxs.
>Fix:
Expand the install-include target to copy os-inline.c. This may be a bit difficult for the platforms where os-inline.c doesn't exist (but maybe they don't use the top-level makefile?)
