>Description:
I've encountered an interesting problem with IE5 on MacOS9. 

We are serving Flash content via a servlet from two different machines.
When connecting to Darth (Apache 1.3.9) the Flash files are being served with no apparent problems.
When I connect to Yoda (Apache 1.3.12) only certain Flash files will load.

I've dicovered in Yoda's access_log that there are an unusual amount of 501 status messages.
Also of note is that the 501 status is ONLY found with respect to the machine I've been testing from.

From what the logs show, I have a feeling that IE5 on Mac is sending a request which the server cannot interpret.
What I need to know is WHY there is the discrepency between 1.3.9 and 1.3.12.

Any help would be appreciated.
