I've managed to work around the feature I logged in bug report 408.

The trick is use a virtual server for the 'main' host, and put the Alias 
directives inside the stanza for that.  It seems that the ones in srm.conf
override those in the httpd.conf, so unless you put them somewhere else 
(like in another virtualhost stanza) they take effect.

Feeel free to close this.
