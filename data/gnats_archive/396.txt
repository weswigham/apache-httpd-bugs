>Environment:
Firewall running Linux 2.0.29, gcc 2.7.2, Pentium 166, 
Slackware 3.1 distribution, Phase of the Moon: 3/4 full
>Description:
I am attempting to use Apache 1.2b8 as an inbound proxy to our Web site.
The configuration is such:
firewall is named gatekeeper and has a CNAME record of www for the outside world
internal web host is named shotgun and has a CNAME record of www for the internal net
gatekeeper resolves www to the correct internal host, not to itself

When using Apache with the poxy module compiled in all access attempts produce
an Apache generated "Index of /" page that conains a .. entry.  Clicking on
the .. gets you no where.  I've tried the following proxy directives:
ProxyRequests On
ProxyPass /* http://www.gundaker.com/
and every derivative I could think of.  ProxyRequests by itself, multiple 
variations on ProxyPass all to no avail.

CERN 3.0a is currently working fine as an inbound proxy, and I haven't had 
any problems with it.  Our internal server is Netscape Commerce 2.1.  
This behavior also occured under 1.2b7.
