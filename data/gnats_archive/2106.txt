NT 4.0 WS, US, SP3 
no compiler, i used the binarys from www.apache.org dated 4.18.98

>Description:
Netscape Navigator 3.03 Client is not able to connect to our
Apache WWW-Server if the proxy module is loaded too.
Netscape Communicator 4.04 can connect at the same time from the same client PC.
I tried it with several NS 3.03 Clients of my colegues with the same result. 
At this time i did not use the Apache as proxy.
The Proxy operates for The NS 3.03 Clients and is fine, but trying to connect to 
the apache Server fails.  I could access internal and external Servers without
Problems, only the Apache itself had problems.
All Communicators had no problems, only the Navigators had problems.

We use The NT 4.0 WS at both, the Server and the Clients, the Patchlevel 
of the Clients was SP2 or SP3.

State-Changed-Why:
What do you mean by "can not connect"?

Is anything in the access or error logs for the attempts?

Exactly what error do you get and what are you getting the
error from?

      Hi
      first i want to thank you for your imediate reply. I played around 
      with my navigators/communicators and maybe it is a problem of our 
      hp-proxy. If i flush my caches and connect to my Apache everything is 
      fine. If i then press the reload button i get an error:
      The requested Icon could not be loaded by the proxy.
      A network error occured:unable to connect to server (TCP Error: can 
      not connect to server or SOCKS server) ..
      Proxy Server at proxy.bbn.hp.com:8088
      What i do not understand is why doesn't this happen when my apache 
      proxy is not loaded.
      
      the errorlog contains the following lines:
