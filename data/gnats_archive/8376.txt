GLIBC 2.1
>Description:
I was receiving segmentation faults every few minutes for unexplained reasons and could not determine why.  I changed loglevel from crit to debug, and they magically stopped.  I believe it has something to do with the log level filtering out entries.
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.
>Fix:
Change loglevel to debug.
