any
>Description:
The content-negotiation page discusses variants files at length; these can
include explicit "qs" values for media types.  The section on multiviews doesn't
even mention source quality, and I cannot find any indication that either the
AddType directive or the mime.types file or the .htaccess file supports a qs
parameter.  How does one indicate that PNG images have a qs of 0.8 and GIFs 0.4
without creating a thousand .var files?
>How-To-Repeat:
read http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html
>Fix:
Document it--but if you have an informal response, please let me know soon...I'm
writing a book on this stuff, and the deadline is approaching rapidly.  Thanks!
