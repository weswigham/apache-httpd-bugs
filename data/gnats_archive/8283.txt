>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
SunOS mill.lsait.lsa.umich.edu 5.8 Generic_108528-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60
Sun Forte C compiler 6.0
>Description:
In Directory and .htaccess context, the directives
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from all
  Allow from 141.211.61.55
do not work properly (regardless of IP address).  Clients visiting pages in
the directory get "403 Access Forbidden".  However, changing the Allow to
  Allow from 141.211.61.255/32
allows clients to access the pages as expected.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache 1.3.20 as a 64-bit binary on Solaris 7 or later
(with Sun Forte C compiler, compile with the "-fast -xtarget=generic64"
flags).  Set up a test page with access controls as described above.
>Fix:
The problem is caused by sign extension on platforms where
sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).  The following patch fixes the problem:

Hope this is helpful.  Please let me know if I can do/provide anything
else.  Thanks for a great piece of software!
