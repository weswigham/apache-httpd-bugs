gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
Quite a few of the following error messages are posted (about 12 a minute
under normal load:

[Thu Jul 30 15:58:17 1998] [error] (16)Device busy: proxy: error deleting old cache file /home/apache/var/proxy/tmp0vHepI
[Thu Jul 30 15:58:18 1998] [error] (17)File exists: proxy: error linking cache file /home/apache/var/proxy/tmp0ymOhX to /home/apache/var/proxy/K/I/F/sIxevi_Vrq5DFtswnCw

The messages don't seem to have a noticable effect on downloaded pages (no
broken images, etc).  This may be cosmetic, but if it's not really a problem
I'd rather not hear about it (and have my logs bloated :-)
>How-To-Repeat:
Running a proxy server should be all that's necessary.  File locking on Solaris
2.6 may be relevant.
>Fix:
File locking, or something that's not thread safe... dunno.
