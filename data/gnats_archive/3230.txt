>Description:
I have a perl sendmail script that is used for form processing
the error happens when I try to execute the following line in the script:
     open (MAIL, "|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t");

then the perl script blows up and the browser is returned with
"Internal Server Error  Premature end of script headers"
>How-To-Repeat:
open (MAIL, "|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t");

State-Changed-Why:
This has nothing to do with Apache, but is completely a perl
thing.  Please see the perl FAQ or documentation or ask in a
perl related support forum.

 That is fine, but it is still not an Apache issue but a perl one.
