>Description:
I have the following lines in my access.conf file. I wish to force users to suppl
enter username/password the first time they attempt top access a site external
to our domain. But they are prompted for user/pass every time they access 
any other external sites as well. Is there a way of authenticating a user 
once i.e. on their first access of an external site ?


<Directory proxy:*>
<Limit GET PUT POST DELETE CONNECT OPTIONS>
order allow,deny
allow from all
require valid-user
AuthType Basic
AuthName membership
AuthUserFile /etc/wwwpasswd
#deny from [machines you'd like *not* to allow by IP address or name]
#allow from [machines you'd like to allow by IP address or name]
</Limit>
</Directory>

State-Changed-Why:
No, this is not possible with current browsers AFAIK.  The
problem is that the browser still acts as if it is accessing
the real site, not the proxy, so for security reasons it 
is not acceptable to send a password from one site to another.
Unfortunately, there isn't anything Apache can do to fix this.
