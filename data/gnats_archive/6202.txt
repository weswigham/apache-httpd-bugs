>Description:
We are having the below problem too at Colorado State
University but we have never used roaming before.
Mac Netscape 4.7 aborts with a type 2 error and
only the initial PUT in the accesslog as described
below.  If we us 4.73 we get a type 1 error.  We
have tried this on various types of Macs.  This 
problem has not surfaced for any clients other than a Mac.
This appears to be an Apache problem since we can use
roaming to a Netscape server from one of these
Macs with no problem.  Besides the standard mods
to Apache, I have installed mod_ssl, mod_auth_dbm,
mod_proxy, and mod_status, mod_roaming.

The following is from the news group  comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
and describes our problem at Colorado State U.  This person is experiencing
the same problem at his site it appears.

>How-To-Repeat:
From a Mac running 4.7 or greater, configure for roaming access to an 
apache 1.3.12 server with mod_roaming installed.   When you try and login with
any login and password you have set up, netscape aborts with a type 2 error. 
If you try and by pass the login netscape drops out and will not start.  You
must remove the netscape prefences file to make netscape functional again.
>Fix:
Check to see if this is not a problem at 1.3.9 as Scott suggests.  If not, then
figure out what broke mod_roaming from 1.3.9 to 1.3.12
