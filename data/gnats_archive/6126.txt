>Description:
Directory listings utilise README.html and HEADER.html
to include directory-specific information. The Apache server begins
the combined output page - HEADER.html (if present), files/dirs, README.html
(if present)- with a 3.2 DOCTYPE, yet there is no guarantee that whatever
the user chooses to put in the README.html or HEADER.html files is at all
compliant with that DOCTYPE.
>How-To-Repeat:
View source on:

http://www.apache.org/dist/

edit HEADER.html or README.html to anything you like. Add some javascript,
some layer tags, and run through the W3C validator.
Admire pointless 3.2 DOCTYPE.

(I note the default 404notfound page - http://www.surrey.ac.uk/blah say - 
has a 2.0 DOCTYPE. Just how many different doctype references are scattered
throughout apache?)
>Fix:
You could:
a) Only output the 3.2 DOCTYPE for directory listings
   if README.html and HEADER.html aren't present.
b) Just leave out the DOCTYPE entirely, since it's probably completely
    useless as far as directory listings go.
c) Change the doctype to 4.01 transitional and hope for the best.
d) build a parser/validator into apache to examine the HEADER.html and
   README.html files and output the appropriate doctype.

I vote b) as the simplest fix; the least misleading option.

a) is possible, but far too much like hard work.
c) is a kludge. d) is ridiculous.
