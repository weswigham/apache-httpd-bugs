>Environment:
Slackware Linux, 2.0.34 kernel
gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
>Description:
When a directory has no index file and a listing of files is returned to the client, garbage may occur.
This only happens when there are filenames of length 25 or greater.
When the garbage is returned, it is immediately following the >= 25 character filename.
After the garbage, the directory listing continues.
If another filename of >= 25 characters is encountered, more garbage shows up.
This happens most of the time, however sometimes the listing is clean.

Also, the "garbage" is not just random data, but data that should be going to other clients who are accessing other web sites hosted on the same server.\
Sometimes the data is nice chunks of a HTML file, other times it's binary spew of an image.

This could be a security risk as well if some sensitive data were presented in the "garbage" listing.

The server performance is not affected by this, file contents are not modified or mangled, only directory listing output is a mess.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a test directory.
Create several files (content is irrelevant) with filenames of various lengths, making sure some are 23, 24, 25, and 26 characters long.
View the directory via web browser, reload as necessary to see none/various garbage.

>Fix:
I have NO clue...this could be anything from filesystem related stuff to shared memory space problems or something else completely.
