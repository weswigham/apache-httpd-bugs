>Description:
I use scriptlog to trace the problem
And I see a problem with the directory name when you install 
apache in a windows machine the usual way is to install it in
"c:\programm files" and that is the point there is a sapce on the name
of the directory.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Could you add the warning to the installation file and to the FAQ.
And add a word about scriptlog in the FAQ because I need two hours to fix the bug.
But seriously I like your server because I need only 1 Hour to use it.
As we say in french "Longue Vie"
