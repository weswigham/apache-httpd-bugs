>Description:
There are some segment fault error when I tried to rebuild the 1.3.9 apache. So,
I tried to install the binary file of 1.3.9 apache. The install is going well. But
when I tried to start the proxy, first complain the libgdbm.so.1 is not
an ELF file. then complain cannot load libgdbm.so.1. I downloaded the libgdbm.so.1
from the net. 
>How-To-Repeat:
install the 1.3.9 apache binary posted on apache download site, then run 
the script startproxy. 
>Fix:
Compile the apache with newer library and put it on the 
internet for download.
