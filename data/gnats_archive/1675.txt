Win95, using precompiled NT binary
>Description:
When the server config files contain the following definitions:

-----
<Directory />
Options None
AllowOverride None
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from none
</Directory>

UserDir users/*/public_html

<Directory /apache/users/*/public_html>
AllowOverride Indexes AuthConfig
Options Indexes IncludesNOEXEC
order allow,deny
allow from all
deny from none
</Directory>
-----

every access to /~test/ (for which c:\apache\users\test\public_html *did* exist)
resulted in a 403 Forbidden error, and the following line in the ErrorLog:
-----
[Thu Jan 15 12:22:46 1998] [error] Client denied by server configuration: c:/apa
che\users\test\public_html\
-----
>How-To-Repeat:
Try the above code (or similar) in your own setup.
>Fix:
When I removed the <Directory /> section, the /~test/ directory loaded correctly.
However all the clauses in the <Directory /> section should have been overridden
by those in the <Directory /apache/users/*/public_html> section... and that 
entry in the ErrorLog looks a bit iffy, using backslashes instead of forward
ones.

 "allow from none" is setting it to allow access from a host named "none".
 Just leave it out if you want to restrict all access.

 What happens if you try including the drive letter, eg. c:/ in the auth
 files?

The value of your UserDir directive appears to be wrong.
Please see the UserDir documentation for usage details.

Of course you are always welcome to submit a bug report
if you think you found an error in Apache.

 This issue is definately still open.

 According to the documentation for UserDir, it *is* valid:
 
 ServerRoot c:/apache
 UserDir users/*/public_html
 
 will map the URL /~test/blah.html to
 C:\Apache\users\test\public_html\blah.html.
 
 And indeed it *does* work, unless the <Directory /> section is included, as
 is recommended in the FAQ.

 Ok, I've tried fiddling around with the entries, and have discovered the
 following:
 
  - The <Directory /> section, when present, seems to 403 my entire site.
  - If changed to <Directory C:>, everything works again (including the user
 dir)
  - If changed to <Directory C:/> or <Directory C:/.> everything stops
 working again.
 
 I definately think that it is a server bug when a single trailing slash
 stops the entire site from working, especially when it should have been
 overridden by later entries in any case.
