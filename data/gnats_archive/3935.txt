>Description:
I am wondering why the ".xls" extension is omitted from mime.types configuration.  Could this be added to the standard distribution?  The type application/vnd.ms-excel is included, but there is no file extension associated, while both ".doc" and ".ppt" for Word and PowerPoint are included.  For consistency sake, perhaps ".xls" can be included as well?  Thanks.

Yeah I added it.  That doesn't mean it'll make it to distribution,
because some folks insist that mime.types match some standard
somewhere and .xls isn't in that standard, or some nonsense like
that.

 Thank you very much.  It's nonsense indeed.  This is yet another case of
 tail wagging the dog.  Are standards not designed to accomodate user needs,
 instead of the other way around?  This reminds me of a system admin that
 refuses to add a mime type in order to maintain a vanilla apache
 distribution.
