Ok a little follow up :
-----------------------

I solved the problem by using the following directive :
RewriteRule  ^proxy:(http:.*) /cgi-bin/proxy.cgi?$1 [PT]

But, it showed me another problem. We have the followin config


Network===apache proxy======>proxy WITH authentification====internet
                \\
                  ==========>proxy WITHOUT authentification===other intranet

When we try to go out to the internet, the client receives an authentification
request. But when it answers, the Proxy-authorization field is blocked by
the apache proxy (modules/proxy/proxy_http.c). There should be a flag in
the ProxyRemote directive telling if a remote proxy should get the
authorization field or not... As a temporary patch, I removed some
code from modules/proxy/proxy_http.c, but ANY remote server receives the
authorization field which is NOT secure at all !
