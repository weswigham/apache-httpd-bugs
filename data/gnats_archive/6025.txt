Sun 450 box with 1 Gb Ram, running Solaris 2.6, used in conjuction with Vignette Storyserver 5.02
>Description:
Gents,

I have been dealing with Vignette tech support with an issue of httpd eating up system ram. We running 1.3.9 on a Solaris 450 running Solaris 2.6 with 1 Gb RAM and 2Gb of swap space. The problem is that httpd eats up all physical ram and then eats up all the swap space.  The solution has been to monitor the site and when we see it eating up the ram, to stop and restart apache.  Vignette keeps telling me it is a apache problem.  We have set max requests per child to 30.

Any insight to fixing this problem would be wonderful.

Thanks very much in advance.
