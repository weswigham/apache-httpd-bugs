>Description:
I believe if you install and choose "custom" it does not set up your /conf/*.*
files foryou. (httpd.conf, etc.)

Also I think it would be nice to put a link to kill (shutdown) the apache server
in the "Apache Web Server" start menu directory, and a shortcut to httpd.conf, as
well, to make it easier.  Maybe a shortcut to a command prompt in the apache
directory, too?  Gotta make it easy :-)
>How-To-Repeat:
install, choose custom, change the directory to something else, or another drive
(I am not sure if this last step is necessary), see what it does.
>Fix:
disable custom?  Cut and paste some directions from normal to custom?  Tell
people not to use custom (if it's true that custom works as described).

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the comments.

First, the "custom" install is intended to allow advanced
users to choose to not install (say) the manual while still
getting the source. Almost every other situation is covered
by the typical or full installations, which most people
should use.

The custom install does work, but it is possible to 
deselect components which are required for Apache to
operate. In particular, if you deselect "Application Files"
you won't get any binaries or standard configuration files,
and if you deselect "Required directories" you won't get a
"conf" directory or any pre-configured configuration files.
Users that deselect components with key names such
as "Application Files" or "Required directories" are
assumed to know what they are doing. 

Secondly, about adding an icon for stopping Apache. This
is a good idea. It would be nice to not install the
start/stop Apache icons on Win NT (where they are not needed
since the SCM can be used), but I don't think that
InstallShield Express 2 can do that. 

I've marked this PR as "suspended" as a reminder to add
a "stop Apache" icon.

 A link to httpd.conf would be good, too, or to the conf directory.
 
 Thanks
