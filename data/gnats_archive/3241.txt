>Description:
Hi,
   I need global FancyIndexing + AddDescriptions in local .htaccess files. I have "FancyIndexing on"
 in my srm.conf and use "AllowOverride Indexes" in access.conf - but "AllowOverride Indexes"
unsets FancyIndexing.

I tried to include "FancyIndexing on" both before and after "AllowOverride Indexes" in access.conf, but it still
does not work properly. When I add "FancyIndexing on" into .htaccess, it works well. But I need to set this option
recursive.

When I use "AddDescriptions" in srm.conf, working good.

Do you have any IndexOptions directives?  If so, add
"FancyIndexing" to them, and get rid of the separate
"FancyIndexing On" directive(s) and see if that makes a
difference.
