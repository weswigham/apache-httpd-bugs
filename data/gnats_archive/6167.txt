Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)

Linux 2.2.14-5.0 #1 Tue Mar 7 21:07:39 EST 2000 i686 unknown
>Description:
I have several virtual hosts set up, the web sites as well as the logs for those web sites are stored on a central server and loaded from this web server via NFS.  I set the LockFile directive to /var/run/apache-lock.  Apache writes data to the log file, as it should, then automatically takes it away from the file, returning the access_log to it's original state, resulting in a net writing of nothing to the log file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put your logs for some virtual host on an NFS mounted filesystem, set the LockFile directive to /var/run/apache-lock.
>Fix:
I have no idea...

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Jun  8 17:27:41 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
Writing logs over NFS is not supported and is not reliable.
This is particularly true on Linux, which has certain very
broken NFS "features".  There is nothing we can or will do
about this.  You really should write to a local disk.
