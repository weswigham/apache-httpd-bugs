>Description:
There's a bug in the AdaptiveClassLoader.loadClass method.
If a class cannot be found loadClass throws an exception
which is ten caught, setting the return variable "c" to null
(I added a couple of println's to the code):

		...
        // Attempt to load the class from the system
        try {
            c = loadSystemClass(name, resolve);
            if (c != null) {
                if (resolve) resolveClass(c);
                return c;
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("failed: " + e);
            c = null;
        }
		...

This falls through a bunch of code, eventually hitting
a while loop. But the while loop exits after its first
iteration by returning "c", even if "c" is null. To
summarize the loop:

        // Cache entry.
        ClassCacheEntry classCache = new ClassCacheEntry();
        while (repEnum.hasMoreElements()) {
            byte[] classData;
            ...
            System.err.println("Returning");
            return c;
        }

This null value makes its way back to the caller at line 421
in JServServletManager:

	...
	servlet = (Servlet) loader.loadClass(classname).newInstance();
	...

which causes a null pointer exception. The net effect of this
is to leave the browser waiting for a reply that never comes,
eventually timing out on the client. This is what my error log
contains:
	
Returning
failed: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com/bitmechanic/gsp/GspServlet
Returning
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at org.apache.jserv.JServServletManager.load_init(JServServletManager.ja
va:424)
        at org.apache.jserv.JServServletManager.loadServlet(JServServletManager.
java:381)
        at org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.run(JServConnection.java:298)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java)

Notice that because the original exception was being swallowed
up, and the null pointer exception had no information on the
source of the error, I had no way of knowing which class it
couldn't find.

Now back to figuring out why it can't find my classes.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure, I haven't figured out why it can't find my classes.
