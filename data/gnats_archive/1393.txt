  We're still waiting. Just how frickin' long can it take to type up an
explanation? Surely *NOT* 1-2 months...

State-Changed-When: Tue Nov 11 11:22:31 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
The documentation changes are underway and should be completed shortly.  If you can not live
without them, then please use a non-beta version of the
software or write them yourself.

Swearing at us gets you nowhere.  Rude PRs are not appreciated.
If you are unhappy with Apache we would much rather prefer
that you use something you may be happer with than that
you repeatedly submit rude PRs.

   This rates as the best and most unprofessional response I have ever
 received from an author of a piece of software -- commercial or free.
 I guess "rude" PRs results in "rude" replies, eh? Congrats.
 
   The bottom line is, laziness is the only thing keeping you guys from
 finishing the job; finishing the job means, writing documentation for
 something before you release it: this includes betas.
 
   The one exception is your CHANGES file: it's EXCELLENT in regards to
 being up-to-date, and on-key.
 
   However, throwing in a directive which breaks all name-based
 VirtualHosts (the NameVirtualHost directive), and not even taking the
 simple time (10 minutes at MAX) to document the feature which can
 supposedly rectify the situation is pure suicide.

   Actually, this is the fastest reply I have *EVER* received from ANY
 of the Apache team. So it has gotten me somewhere as far as I'm
 concerned.
 
   And that's okay: inability to document functions which break previously
 working ones isn't appreciated either.

   My submissions have obviously gotten you guys riled up enough to
 pay attention to the situation, and do something about it. That's all that
 my post was intended to do.
 
   Have a nice day.
