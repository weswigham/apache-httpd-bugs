POSTs timeout unless they are from the local host.
i.e. I can run a CGI script using Lynx from the local machine and
everything works fine. If I try the same CGI from Netscape (3.04,
4.04, or 4.5) from a remote machine, the POST times out. The only log
message issued is that the POST timed out (408). I turned on debug
level messages and the error log gave a message "read request headers
timed out".

I don't see a problem with any of the given URLs.
If you have turned on Hostnamelookups try to turn them off.

 I do have Hoastnamelookups set to Off. I find no indication in the 
 logs that you actually tried to POST anything using either of the 
 URLs listed, only that you looked at the page. Try subscribing to the 
 test mailing list or adding a calendar item. Both will fail with a 
 timeout and both worked correctly under Apache 1.2.6.

I just did that, but still don't see problem.
The POST-request did not time out.
