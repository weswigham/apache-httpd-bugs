I've been using

NameVirtualHost hostname
<VirtualHost hostname1:80>
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost hostname1:443>
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost hostname2:80>
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost hostname3:80>
</VirtualHost>

and this has worked fine for a long time and many apache versions

but when I try to add
<VirtualHost hostname2:443>
</VirtualHost>

The second vhost with port 443 just acts as if the port number isn't even there,
I get the first vhost:443 instead. I know it's working at least that much, since SSL
is enabled on that port. 

Is this a configuration problem or a bug?

Seems like the namevhost stuff is just matching on name, but not on name:port.

 Um, That is implying that ml and ml2 are different IPs, which they are not.
 
 I currently have:
 
 Listen *:80
 Listen *:443
 
 Isn't that going to give me a error the moment I put that extra listen on
 there?
 
 Yeah, like I thought:
 
 [Mon Oct 16 09:11:54 2000] [crit] (98)Address already in use: make_sock:
 could not bind to address x.x.x.x port 443.
 
 I'm trying to do this with named vhosts remember. The named vhosts are
 working just fine for all the :80's, and the first :443. But the second :443
 doesn't work properly, it just sends back the first :443.

 Yes! That worked. Thank you!
 
 Y'all might consider adding a comment to the virtual hosting docs to say
 that if you are going to do named vhosts with more than one port, you need
 to specify the possible ports with multiple NameVirtualHost lines. (It also
 worked just fine using a hostname in the NVH line.)
 
 Thanks again!
