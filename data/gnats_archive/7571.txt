>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 service pack 6.0
Windows 2000
>Description:
We are using Apache 1.3 and JServ 1.1.1 in a windows NT4.0 environment. The webpages are both static and servlet generated. Apache works well when it is started and inputs from a form were submitted to a servlet (that creates a session) to process and create a web page. However after about 20-30 minutes when a client tries to refresh or reload the form data, Netscape 4.7 returns " document contained no data" and IE5 returns a blank page. Static pages are accessible at any time. We do not have any problem with static pages. We have noticed that only when Apache is stopped and restarted, a client can access the servlet generated pages. And restarting the server does not help. None of the log files Apache, JServ, mod_jserv shows any error.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
This problem can be resolved by stopping and then starting the server (rather than issuing a restart).
