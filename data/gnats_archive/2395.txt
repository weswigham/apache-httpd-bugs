>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
OS/2 Warp 4.0 (rev. 9.030), gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
If any WWW-site is being accessed through the proxy, and 'CacheRoot' is 
commented out (caching disabled), a coredump occurs (and the browser returns
a 'Document contains no data').

When caching is enabled ('CacheRoot' uncommented), the proxy seems to work
correctly (at least for the few sites I've tested).
>How-To-Repeat:
Happens with (almost?) any site, including www.apache.org
>Fix:
I have no suggested way to fix this, only a workaround;
just uncomment 'CacheRoot', if you don't want any caching to
occur you can probably use 'CacheSize 0' or 'NoCache *'

Comment-Added:

I'm not able to reproduce this problem under Linux.
Maybe a bug of the OS/2 version only...
