Subject: mod_alias/5630: Multiple ScriptAlias does not work, ScriptAliasMatch not suitable for the task
Date: Tue, 25 Jan 2000 05:58:01 -0800 (PST)

 Hi,
 
 Alternate solution:
 Using ScriptAliasMatch you can configure the server so
 that 
 a request for a CGI script /cgi-bin/foo.pl will be
 called from  /home/www/cgi-bin/foo.pl
 and a request for a CGI script /mydir/cgi-bin/foo.pl
 will be called from /home/www/mydir/cgi-bin/foo.pl
 
 ScriptAliasMatch ^/cgi-bin(.*)
 /home/www/cgi-bin/foo.pl
 ScriptAliasMatch ^/mydir/cgi-bin(.*)
 /home/www/mydir/cgi-bin/foo.pl

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: slive
State-Changed-When: Sun Sep 17 22:02:27 PDT 2000
State-Changed-Why:
ScriptAlias is not designed to do this.
mod_rewrite does have the capability to check
for the existence of a file before rewriting,
so you may want to check that.

Thanks for using apache.
