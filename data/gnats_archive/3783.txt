>Release:        1.3.4
>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 
>Description:
I've Java packages on the Server. A common name/directory for Java packages
is com. Apache refuses to let the Client access a com directory.
Simillar names like comm are fine. Yet, com is the common name for Java
packages/directory. 
>How-To-Repeat:
This is easy:
- Create a 'com' sub-directory under the Server document root directory
- Try to access it from a Client.
- Yoy'll get a 403 error code
>Fix:
No, since it looks as something internal to Apache
