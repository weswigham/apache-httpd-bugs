>Environment:
WinNT 4.0 Service Pack 3 running IIS 3.0
Using Apache 1.3.3 binary downloaded from www.apache.org
>Description:
1.  In httpd.conf, define a directory with ScriptAlias, ensure that the directory name and ScriptAlias are different.  e.g.

Dir is E:\WWW\users\mywebsite\directory1

ScriptAlias /myscripts/ E:/WWW/users/mywebsite/directory1

2.  In this same directoryu, place a pure HTML file (not CGI) say index.htm
3.  Try accessing the file http://www.mywebsite.com/myscripts/index.htm

    The following error message appears:

Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@www.crewnoble.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

e:/www/users/crewnoble/xxxtestxxx/index.htm is not executable; ensure interpreted scripts have "#!" first line



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache/1.3.3 Server at www.crewnoble.com Port 8080

Note:  In this case I was running the Apache server on port 8080.  I did not try it on port 80.
>How-To-Repeat:
Please call me at 919-544-4101 (USA EST, 8:30am - 5:30pm) or send me an email ans I will set up a live demo for you.  Unfortunately I cannot have a live demo permanently set up.
>Fix:
Unfortunately, no.  HTML files under ScriptAlias dirs must be served
normally.

State-Changed-When: Fri Dec  4 19:18:26 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
That is the whole point of the ScriptAlias directive!  It
is clearly documented as being a directive used when you want all the
files in a directory to be executed.

It doesn't make any sense to say that files shouldn't be
executed if you have just said they should be using the ScriptAlias
directive.

If you don't want all files in the directory to be executed,
check the docs and use the ExecCGI option plus an Addhandler
for the extensions you do want executed.
