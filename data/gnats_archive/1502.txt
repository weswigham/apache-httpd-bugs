>Description:
If i use Virtual Hosts, when open a page from a browser, it always open the first
Virtual Host that i put on http.conf.
I have www.apmp.pt -> 194.65.48.15
And autor.iland.pt in the same IP address.

This machine is registered on DNS with autor.iland.pt
>How-To-Repeat:

#Part of httpd.conf

<VirtualHost autor.iland.pt>

        ServerAdmin freddy@autor.iland.pt
        DocumentRoot /usr/local/WWW/htdocs
        ServerName autor.iland.pt
        ErrorLog logs/autor/error_log
        TransferLog logs/autor/access_log

</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost www.apmp.pt>

        ServerAdmin freddy@autor.iland.pt
        DocumentRoot /usr/local/WWW/htdocs/apmp
        ServerName www.apmp.pt
        ErrorLog logs/apmp/error_log
        TransferLog logs/apmp/access_log

</VirtualHost>

# End

If  i use http://www.apmp.pt/, goes to the first Virtual Host, if i use 
http://autor.iland.pt/ goes also to the first Virtual Host

 Both those hosts have the same address.  Please check your error_log,
 there's likely a message there waiting for you.  Have you read the new
 vhost documentation mentioned in the upgrade instructions?
