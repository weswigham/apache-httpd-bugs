 Are your sure? The "[*]" is not a wildcard, it's just a marker which should
 indicate that not exactly the file is installed, but a slightly adjusted
 version. The "[*]" is only part of an `echo' command and not part of the
 `install.sh' command line. So when you've problems with ksh under AIX it has
 to be related to other things IMO.
