>Organization:
>Environment:
AIX 5.1.0.0, GCC 3.0.2
>Description:
srclib/apr/threadproc/signals.c provides a workaround for sigwait() on AIX by
explicitly masking sig_mask.hisigs.  That structure member only is present in
32-bit mode, so signals.c fails to compile in 64-bit mode.

One can test for 64-bit mode on AIX by testing the __64BIT__ macro.  I do not
know if 64-bit AIX sigwait() has the same problem and if the same bit needs to
be masked.  I naively modified the code to mask the equivalent high-order bit
in the 64-bit structure to allow signals.c to compile, which allowed httpd to
build and run.
signals.c to compile.
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile srclib/apr/threadproc/signals.c in 64-bit mode.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your report.  This has already been fixed in CVS.

You may be interested in 

   http://www.apache.org/~trawick/aixstatus.html

which tracks various outstanding issues with Apache 
2.0 on AIX.  In particular, there is a 64-bit issue 
with send_file() to avoid.

Thanks for using Apache!
