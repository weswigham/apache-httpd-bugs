>Description:
I have 1.2.5 working with a number of virtual IP hosts.  I have tried to migrate these to vanilla 1.3.5.
i.e. no --compat.  My problem is that any attempt to invoke virtual starts using a commandline such as
/usr/local/apache/apache_1.3.2/sbin/httpd -f /usr/local/apache/apache_1.3.2/virtuals/www.pathtech.org/httpd.conf
does not result is a working virtual.  Through researching I gather that the "Listen" command
now appears to be required but the problem is whether it must be in the main httpd.conf or msut be
in the virtual httpd.conf. In other words, migration/upgrading is extermely difficult. 

Please provide guidance and I shall draft an addendum for the migration doc to cover this experience.

>How-To-Repeat:
By prior arrangement, I can give access to my site.
>Fix:
Improve the migration doc. As I said above I am willing to draft an addendum once things 
start working.

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly due to you not reading the vhost
docs.  Please go through them at
http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/

Since you don't mention the little detail of _HOW_ you are trying]
to configure these vhosts, I'm afraid I can't comment more.

The Listen command is not required, but what is required
is the NameVirtualHost directive.

Also note that "1.3.5" doesn't exist, as you claim you are using.

 Done this and found that what I need is not included. i.e. migrating
 from 1.2.5 to 1.3,x.
 
 I invoke apache via /etc/init.d/apache complete with all the hard links.
 Sartup looks something like this:
 
 #! /sbin/sh
 #
 # Start/Stop Apache
 #
 
 umask 2
 APACHEROOT=/usr/local/apache/apache_1.3.2 export APACHEROOT
 
 case "$1" in
 'start')
 	if [ -f  $APACHEROOT/sbin/httpd -a  $APACHEROOT/etc/httpd.conf ]; then
 		echo "Apache starting."
 		 $APACHEROOT/sbin/httpd -f  $APACHEROOT/etc/httpd.conf
 	fi
 	for i in  $APACHEROOT/virtuals/*/httpd.conf
 	do
 		$APACHEROOT/sbin/httpd -f $i
 	done
 	;;
 ...
 
 
 The main server starts but not the virtuals.

 I'm sure you could have.
 
 I'm using individual hhtpd.conf files.  Remember, I'm migrating as shown
 above.

 Ah ha! Okay I'll look it up but it would help to know where to put the
 directive(s).  Main .conf or in the individuals?  I ma attempting to
 migrate 400 virtuals and need to understand the new mechanisms.
 Otherwise the exercise will not be fruitful.

 typo it should be 1.3.2. Sorry

 They are not virtual hosts as far as Apache is concerned!
 
 We do not have the time or resources to sit around trying to guess what
 you mean, what your setup is, and exactly what you are seeing, what you
 think you should see, what errors you are getting, what your logfiles are
 saying.  If you refuse to give us details of your settings, except from
 what we can grudgingly drag out of you, or any reason to think there is
 any sort of bug in Apache, we can do nothing.
 
 If you don't want to read the docs but want people to tell you how Apache
 works, and walk you through figuring out how to setup a server then this
 is not the place, as is clearly detailed before you submit a bug report.

 I submit a bug because your docs and the program do NOT behave as one
 would expect form what little is documented.  Further the logs are EMPTY
 so why would I send them?  Not a reasonable expectation on your part.
 
 The "Overview of new features" contains no mention of changes to the way
 virtusla are handled.  This IS a BUG in my opinion.  
 
 I asked if virtuals needed to be declared in etc/httpd.conf.  So far 
 no answer and as this is distinctly differenct behaviour from 1.2.5 at
 the very least we have a migration issue.

 From my previous message and the example above it should be patently
 clear that I have indidual httpd.conf files for my virtuals.  I can't
 understand why you'd say this.

 Then GNATS is truncating messages. It did this in gnats-3.2 as well.
 
 I do not have control of the software at your end, you do. Perhsp it's
 time for a review of your system.
 
 Back to the problem.  the following example fails to work:
 
 /usr/local/apache/apache_1.3.2/sbin/httpd -f
 /usr/local/apache/apache_1.3.2/virtuals/www.pathtech.org/httpd.conf
 
 Specifally no errors, no log and no deamon.  This difference is
 undocumented and causes failure of my virtuals.  I have even read
 "Sections inside <VirtualHost> sections are applied after the
 corresponding sections outside the
 virtual host definition. This allows virtual hosts to override the main
 server configuration. (Note: this
 only works correctly from 1.2.2 and 1.3a2 onwards. Before those releases
 sections inside virtual
 hosts were applied before the main server). "
 
 Interesting but this note does not apply to my experience.  
 
 I'll be gad to RTFM but would appreciate a pointer.

State-Changed-Why:

Well, let's get one thing clear: what you're doing is *not*
running a 'main' server and 'virtual' servers.  You're
running N completely separate server processes.  The term
'virtual' refers to having a single process able to handle
requests for multiple IP addresses or host names.  That's
not what you're doing.

Now.  When you issue the command that you say doesn't
work, do you get any display?  You say it was equivalent
to this (edited for width):

  # cd /usr/local/apache/apache_1.3.2
  # sbin/httpd -f virtuals/www.pathtech.org/httpd.conf

correct?  Since you're not including a '&' at the end,
it should tie up your session.  Does it?  Do you have to
hit CTRL/C in order to check for the daemon?

 I have yet to get multiple httpd's up and running.  I think this results
 from each new httpd seeing a running copy and subsequently not starting.  I
 have not found a solution as yet.  Off-line conversations with various
 support people did not lead to a working solution.
 
 Please keep the ticket open until February 1st 1999.  On that date close it
 period.
