>Description:
I'm getting wierdness out of mod_include, but maybe just because I don't
know what I'm doing. Here's my problem.

<!--#set var="SUB1" value="News&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Events" -->
<!--#echo var="SUB1" -->

The result is:
News&nbsp;& Events

Also, when I test
<!--#elif expr="${SUB1} = News&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Events" -->
I get false.

Am I using some reserved characters I don't know about? I didn't see
anything in the mod_include manual, or on the Apache bugs database.
>How-To-Repeat:
<!--#set var="SUB1" value="News&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Events" -->
<!--#echo var="SUB1" -->

The result is:
News&nbsp;& Events

Also, when I test
<!--#elif expr="${SUB1} = News&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Events" -->
I get false.
