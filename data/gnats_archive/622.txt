>Environment:
Linux 2.0.24 using gcc and gdbm 1.7.3 Perl 5.003 and PHP/FI 2.0b11
>Description:
After loading up a blank machine to repeat this problem, here is what happens :

I need to get Apache, Perl and PHP/FI running with gdbm to do user authentification.

I am now in a position where the Apache perl script dbmmanage uses the GDBM library
loaded in Perl. I can also read this file using a .phtml script, again 'gdbm'

The problem is that I can not get Apache to read this db file. It reports in the
error log :-

access to /usr/local/etc/apache/htdocs/dbm/htpasswd failed for tg8-28.netculture.net, reason: could not open dbm auth file

This is with the -l gdbm put in the Configuration file. I had to delete the
option for -ldb as this is not supplied running in our configuration.


The default library in mod_auth_dbm.c is :
#include <ndbm.h>

According to the gdbm source, a sample library is installed to be compatible with
'ndbm.h'

Unfortunately not being an expert in this field I can not see if this is a problem
with gdbm or Apache. The Apache documentation does however recommend getting 
'gdbm' for this type of work. I have also tried on numerous occasions for light
on this on UseNet without success.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install gdbm 1.7.3 and compile Perl with this library available.
Modify the Apache 'dbmmanage' script to add the following line at the start
of the file :-
use GDBM_File;

Run 'dbmmanage' to create the dbm file.

Try to use 
AuthDBMAuthoritative off
AuthDBMUserFile /usr/local/etc/apache/htdocs/dbm/htpasswd

I have also tried with AuthDBMAuthoritative on and still the same results.

State-Changed-Why:
What does your final link line for apache show?  It should have
the -lgdbm and probably no other -l options.  

Could it be something as simple as specifying the dbm filename with
the appropriate extension as well?  With true-dbm there is a .dir and
a .pag, but with -ldb or -lgdbm there's only a single file (whose
extension escapes me at the moment).

State-Changed-Why:
I'm curious if you ever got this to work.  We haven't seen
any other reports exactly like it.  But there are some issues
with the dbm linking in 1.2, which are fixed in 1.3.  In
particular if you use mod_auth_dbm it will automatically add
-ldbm, which doesn't work.  I think that's what you're alluding
to when you say you had to remove -ldb.

No feedback, stale PR, some changes have been made to
