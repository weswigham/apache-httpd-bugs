This is clearly not the case as killing our LIVE apache 1.2.6 server 
(130 processes at mid-load) and attempting to start httpd1.3.0 results in 
the same crash. Despite the dead 1.2.6 server freeing up some 30+ FD's, 
1.3.0 still claims that 15 is the max it can open.

Confused.

 How many total logfiles is it trying to open?  How many error logs?  How
 many access logs?
 
 How many "Listen" directives do you have in your config file?
 
 What does a "ulimit -n" show before you start Apache?
 
 Did you compile your previous server with any special flags to make it
 work?
 
 What is the _exact_ error that you get?

 Are you using piped logs?

 Nah, am on a red herring there then.
 
 It seems that this is not a unique problem, Joe Kupiszewski
 <joe@packet.net> has reported the same problem in bug report 2430, again on
 solaris 2.5.1, and again running quite a few virtual hosts.
 
 Have tried all of the fixes suggested in his bug article too, but without
 success.
