>Description:
In executing /cgi/bin/test-cgi, i get the following result:
CGI/1.0 test script report:

argc is 0. argv is .

SERVER_SOFTWARE =
SERVER_NAME =
GATEWAY_INTERFACE =
SERVER_PROTOCOL =
SERVER_PORT =
REQUEST_METHOD =
HTTP_ACCEPT = 
PATH_INFO = 
PATH_TRANSLATED = 
SCRIPT_NAME = 
QUERY_STRING = 
REMOTE_HOST =
REMOTE_ADDR =
REMOTE_USER =
AUTH_TYPE =
CONTENT_TYPE =
CONTENT_LENGTH =

In executing /cgi/bin/test-cgi, i get the following result:
________________ = 
Apache/1.3.9 Server at localhost.localdomain Port 80

_______________ = HTTP/1.0
______________ = GET
_____________ = /usr/local/apache/htdocs
____________ = 
___________ = /cgi-bin/printenv
_________ = OGSf038AAAEAAAJUFmA
____________________ = en
____ = /sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/apache/bin
___________________ = iso-8859-1,*,utf-8
_________________ = CGI/1.1

It seems the environment variable name is incorrect. From the above observation,
REQUEST_METHOD is replaced as ______________, and I can only get the value in 
Perl by $ENV{______________} instead of $ENV(REQUEST METHOD).
>How-To-Repeat:
Sorry, I just run the apache locally.

No idea.
