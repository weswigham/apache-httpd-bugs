>Description:
(This is related to PR 1598.)
In the Common Log Format, the HTTP request line
is the fifth field and enclosed in double quotes.  Here is the request line
of a recent log entry from our server:

"GET /"d49her/calvin/jumpstation.html HTTP/1.0"

(Note how the user has entered a double quote instead of a squiggle.)
In order to make it possible to parse a line in the
log (with reasonable convenience), double quotes appearing in the request
line ought to be protected so they do not appear to finish the request
line field.
>How-To-Repeat:
Submit a request containing a double quote in the local part.
>Fix:
When writing the request line to the log (between double quotes),
replace " with \", \ with \\ and newline with \n (the usual C style
conventions).  Typical request lines do not include any of ", \ or newline
and will not be affected by this, but bogus requests will no longer mess up
the log

State-Changed-Why:

Yet another deficiency of the Common Log Format.  We
can't \-escape quotation marks in the %r value because
that would break any custom log formats that *didn't*
encode it as \"%r\" -- aside from munging something
we're supposed to be reporting verbatim.  And the volume
of requests with " in them wouldn't seem to be significant,
anyway; certainly not enough to justify having the logger
determine whether %r was inside a quoted string or not.

I guess the basic answer is that this is a misfeature of
the CLF with which we just have to live.  Sorry.
