>Description:
I'm trying to construct some cgi scripts wich permit to insert a password and 
test it on the server, and i can't do the POST on the server, only the GET 
works, in the configuration file (access.conf) i have the directive <LIMIT GET 
POST> so both must work, the error received is this:

Method not implemented

POST to /home/mavilde/public_html/cgi-bin/admin.pl not supported.

what can i do to implement this method on the apache server.

You are using an ancient version of Apache. Please upgrade
to a recent version.

On the other hand your report is a configuration problem
and no bug report. Please use comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
