>Description:
1. I've set up Apache to support Content-Negotiation by setting the apropriate
   AddLanguage's, LanguagePriority, in srm.conf,
   and MultiViews for all Dirs.
   LanguagePriority is set only to "de" (setting to "de en fr" produces the
   same effect)
2. If an browser not capable to send Accept-Language: 
   (also tested with telnet)
   mainly the English page apears, if not available any other language, eccept 
   the expected "german".
3. If the Browser sends, p.e. Accept-Language: de,en,fr 
   it gets the german page, as expected. But if the Browser
   sends Accept-Language: de,en,fr,* (with trailing asterisk),
   it gets the englisch page in most cases

   
>How-To-Repeat:
An URL to test is http://www.ph-erfurt.de/other/
there should apear a "Welcome" in many languages, depending on
language preferences.
>Fix:
none until now. still trying

 Hi Marc,
 
 first the good message: it fixes a little bit:
 
 No Accept: -> browser gets the default 
 Accept: de    browser gets german
 Accept: de,en,*  browser gets german if possible or en, or ...
 Accept: de,*  browser gets englisch hu? schould not be, what?
 
 Current Configuration: 
 
 LanguagePriority de en fr 
 
 but now we can live with it.
 
 But the mod_negotiation seems to have another problem:
 
 the vary-maps dont work at all, I ve set up a test with
 a file picture.gif (62079 bytes) and a file picture.jpg (22578 bytes)
 
 now one of the tests:
 HEAD /other/picture.var HTTP/1.0
 Accept: image/gif;q=0.5;maxbytes=30000, image/jpeg;q=0.4, */*
 
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 Date: Mon, 24 Feb 1997 04:42:01 GMT
 Server: Apache/1.2b7
 Connection: close
 Content-Type: image/gif
 Expires: Mon, 24 Feb 1997 04:42:01 GMT
 Last-Modified: Sat, 11 Jan 1997 16:49:31 GMT
 ETag: "9864-f27f-32d7c49b"
 Content-Length: 62079
 Accept-Ranges: bytes
 
 
 but I expected the picture.jpg here, because the file as .gif
 is 62079 bytes and therefore larger than maxbytes.
 
 
 have you tried this?
 
 regards,

 This is an old bug report, but still open in the bug database. 
 
 The LanguagePriority header has no effect if the request includes an
 Accept-Language: header. This is because under HTTP/1.1 Accept-Language
 can include priority values (q=X) for each language. It would be difficult
 to sensibly merge the explicity q values with implicity LanguagePriority
 priorities.

 Do you have the file size listed in the type map itself? If a type map is
 used, Apache will not get any information from the file itself(*), so put
 the size into the type map (using Content-Length: lines). 
 
 Also HTTP/1.1 no longer defines the maxbytes parameter, so do not expect
 browsers to send it. However Apache should still honor it if it is
 present. If your type-map does include sizes and either the maxbytes is
 being ignored, or the smallest most-acceptable variant is not being
 selected, send a copy of your type-map so we can have a look at the
 problem. 
 
 (*) Actually Apache will use the information from the file when it returns
 the file in the response, which can lead to inconsistency, but this is a
 whole different problem.

 but the server should correctly handle the * value, and give the 
 next matching language back.
 The current behavior leeds into confusion by the user, if he has 
 the browser configured this way: de,en,* (or includet the * in any way)

 Ok, here the file:
 
 URI: pce500
 
 URI: pce500.jpg
 Content-type: image/jpeg; qs=0.1
 Content-lenght: 22578
 
 URI: pce500.gif
 Content-type: image/gif; qs=0.1
 Content-Length: 62079
 
 the File can be found at http://www.ph-erfurt.de/other/pce500.var
