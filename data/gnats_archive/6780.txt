using the NATIVE cc compiler.  But I don't think that it matters. 
>Description:
During apache's startup, apache dlopen's all the shared library's, and then dlcloses them, and then re-dlopens them.  This causes some issues on UnixWare with some of the routines in -lsocket.  There is some static initialization that happens when some of these routines are called.  If an extension, such as PHP4 in my case, needs -lresolv in addition to -lsocket, we wind up with a wrong function pointer stored in the static data section.  A quick fix in my case was to force -lresolv into the apache link.  My question is why do we do this?  there is *NO* guarantee that the libraries will wind up at the same place in memory. 
>How-To-Repeat:
see above
>Fix:
Don't dlopen/dlclose/dlopen just dlopen once.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a "feature" rather than a bug. Does Apache work without
-lresolv and without php? (I would have expected it to need
-lresolv.) Is php linked with -lresolv? We can add -lresolv
to the configure script if it fixes the problem. In the more
general case of modules having difficulties with the double-
load there are standard ways to deal with it which I would
expect PHP to use. In any case, apache-2.0 handles this completely
differently, and loads modules only once.

 Yes, apache runs without -lresolv.  PHP needs -lresolv, but
 apache apparently doesn't. 
 
 If we could add it for future 1.3 releases (at least for 
 UnixWare), I'd appreciate it. 
 
 When 2.0 goes beta, I'll try it and PHP and see how it goes. 
 
 Thanks!

I've added -lresolv to the libraries list for UnixWare 7.
Thanks for using Apache!
