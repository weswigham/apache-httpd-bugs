State-Changed-Why:
This problem has been observed by a small handful of users,
including yourself.

What LoadModule lines do you have in the server?  Since all
binaries and libraries reside in bin/ and the modules reside
in modules/ (and modules are loaded with both ->bin/ and
->modules/ using the LoadModuleEx schema) I'm having alot
of trouble understanding what the exact problem is here.

Can you provide some more details of your original failure?
