>Description:
For some reason apache jserv does not appear to get the system date correctly. 
The following line of code in my servlet. 

Date curDate = new Date();

incorrectly reports yesterday's date until 10.00am after which it switches over to the correct date. For example if today is 31/5/00 the date reported in the class Date curDate = new Date() is 30/5/00 (until 10.00am). At first, I thought this may be a problem with my standard JVM installation so I tested a normal java application which works fine. Therefore, I guess, it must be something to do with JVM startup initialisation that mod_jserv does. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Try the following line of code in any servlet:

Date curDate = new Date();
System.out.println(curDate);
>Fix:
The problem must be to do with the way the JVM starts up (ie.timezone settings)-but the documentation does not help in fixing this apparent bug.
