>How-To-Repeat:
cd apache_1.3.6
./configure
make
>Fix:
I've had a preliminary look at one of the offending files "src/ap/ap_md5c.c"
On line 482 -> "ap_MD5Update(&ctx, pw, strlen(pw));"
variable "pw" is passed into the calling function as "const char *"
although decleration for function ap_MD5Update calls for a "AP_MD5_CTX *"
