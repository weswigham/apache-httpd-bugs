>Release:        1.3.3
>Environment:
FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE
gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
When trying to load a DSO using LoadModule, Apache complains.  For example,
when trying to load mod_env.so, apache complains about not being able to find 
_mod_env.so
>How-To-Repeat:
run ./configure --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE
under FreeBSD 3.0
>Fix:
I fixed by modifying os/unix/os.h around the #define DLSYM_NEEDS_UNDERSCORE
The line should be

#if (defined(__FreeBSD__) || defined(__OpenBSD__) || defined(__NetBSD__)) && !defined(__ELF__)
