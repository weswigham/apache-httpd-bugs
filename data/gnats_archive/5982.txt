>Description:
When I start the Apache Server, the start-up screen flickers and disappears rather than setting an icon in the task bar at the bottom of the screen. The server cannot be shut down, either, with Stop Apache. It is continually running.
>How-To-Repeat:
???
>Fix:
Tried to set KeepAlive Off in httpd.conf, but this did not help.

 Sorry, but please disregard the bug report I submitted. The server was
 configured in start|services to start automatically. I've changed it to
 manual and it has solved the problem. Thank you!
