>Description:
Is something like this legal?

 <Location /foobar>
  ...
  <Files /usr/local/something>
  ...
  </Files>
 </Location>

 My tests showed that it does not work as expected, but
 Apache does not complain about it (when using <Location>
 inside <Location> he does).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Apache should complain about such a construct

State-Changed-Why:
Given that the order of processing is Directory, Files, then
Location I doubt this is intended to work.  But the way the
code is currently structured it looks difficult to detect
this and report an error.

Files within Directory should work.  Please try your example
again with 1.2b8 and if it fails provide more details.

Thanks

Comment-Added:
Just noting that this is definately a bug.  Apache should
complain when <Files> are used within <Location>s.
