State-Changed-Why:
Does your OS have syslog at all?  Does a "man syslog" give
anything?

There may be an extra library necessary to include to
get it.

If not, you need to remove #define HAVE_SYSLOG from the UW
section of src/main/conf.h.  If we can verify that this
is a general Unixware thing and not particular to your box,
this will be changed in future releases.

 Sure... as did all versions of Unixware
 
 >Does a "man syslog" give anything?
 
 Here's the top of the man page:
 
  syslog(3G)                                                syslog(3G)
 
        NAME
              syslog, openlog, closelog, setlogmask - control system log
 
        SYNOPSIS
              cc [flag . . . ] file . . . -lgen [library] . . .
              #include <syslog.h>
              void openlog(const char *ident, int logopt, int facility);
              void syslog(int priority, const char *message, . . . /* parameters
 */);
              void closelog();
              int setlogmask(int maskpri);

 Yes, the above mentioned -lgen library does the trick...
 Thanks a lot for the hint :-) I just compiled it (with cc
 which is provided with all versions of UW, gcc is 
 hard to find, so not everyone has it...)

 It's a general Unixware thing, I've tried it on 3 different versions/boxes...
 uw 2.03, 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 all need this Library.

 PS. Great job so far, it's a lot faster and I really like the unbuffered CGI
 output!
