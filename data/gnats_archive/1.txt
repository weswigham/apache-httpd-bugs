>Environment:
BSDI 2.0, current CVS snapshot, using GCC
>Description:
In the config files, if a <virtualhost> specification for a Host:-based
vhost does not appear before the first <virtualhost> for IP-based vhosts,
then the host-based vhost will not work. I.e., if you have vhost11.com and 
vhostIP.com representing HTTP/1.1-host:-header-based vhost and an older 
1.0-mandated IP-based vhost in the other, with a config file which looks like

 <VirtualHost 11.22.33.45>
 ...
 ServerName vhostIP.com
 </VirtualHost>

 <VirtualHost 11.22.33.44>
 ...
 ServerName vhost11.com
 </VirtualHost>

then "vhost11.com" will not show up, instead access to
http://vhost11.com/ will default to whatever the main web server's home
pages are.  The vhost11.com section must be placed *BEFORE* vhostIP.com
in order to work.
>How-To-Repeat:
See above.
