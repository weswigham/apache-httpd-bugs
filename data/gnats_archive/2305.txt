>Environment:
Win 95, german version, no patches
no DNS
>Description:
cgi launch works but environment contains complete trash,
i.e. short lines of control characters, not any key=value pair.
>How-To-Repeat:
after fresh installation I performed the following steps:

added three entries to the .conf's:

ServerName localhost
AddHandler cgi-script .bat
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /apache/cgi-bin

and installed a test.bat in /apache/cgi-bin containing:

set>file

(this is the cooked-down version, first encounter was with an
ordinary perl-cgi)
