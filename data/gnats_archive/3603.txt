Both Child and Parent directories are shown with the same icon.

It does not take in account the directive:
AddIcon /icons/Bultas/back.gif ..

Icon is taken from directive:
AddIcon /icons/folder.gif ^^DIRECTORY^^

State-Changed-Why:

Where are you placing the AddIcon directive?  If it's in
an .htaccess file, are you sure that the directory is
covered by an 'AllowOverride Indexes' scope?  If it's
in a server config file (e.g., httpd.conf), are you
sure it isn't being overridden by an AddIcon directive
elsewhere?  I can't reproduce this behaviour on Unix; it
works just fine for me there.

 I have checked all config files. The only two AddIcon directives,
 which deals with directories, are mentioned in problem description.
 
 Thank You for response and Happy New Year.

 Hmmm.  I have been able to reproduce this with
 the Win32 1.3.3 kit.  My Unix testing was with
 the latest code stream, so perhaps something
 was fixed in this area since 1.3.3 was released.
 I'll check.  Thanks for the additional info!

This is fixed, in Apache 2.0.23, for all platforms.
It is unlikely to be changed in the 1.3 tree.
Thanks for the report!
