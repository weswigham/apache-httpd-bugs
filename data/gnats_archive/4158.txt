SunOS 5.5 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

>Description:
Downloaded: /dist/binaries/solaris/apache_1.3.6-sun4u-sun-solaris2.260.tar.gz

Problem 1: bin/httpd searched the wrong directory for httpd.conf (it searched 
the /usr/local/... directory, instead of the installation directory.

Problem 2: I recompiled with the --prefix=INSTALL_DIR option that installed 
the binaries, but bin/httpd gave the following error:

baldric 769% bin/httpd
Syntax error on line 201 of /afs/ncsa.uiuc.edu/projects'/hdf/user/apu/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'LoadModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration

Thanks,

State-Changed-Why:
1) It sounds like you're installing somewhere that the pre-compiled
binary isn't meant to be installed.

2) You need to enable mod_so, add "--enable-module=so" or something
like that to the "./configure" command line.

Thanks for choosing apache!
