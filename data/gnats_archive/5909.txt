Windows NT 4.0 SP5, using pre-compiled binary.
>Description:
Previous versions of Apache defaulted to encoding="none" (ie the attribute wasn't available). Version 1.3.12 introduces the encoding attribute (very useful) but it defaults to encoding="entity". Thus any pages previously written (which assumed the default encoding="none") will break if the change of encoding affects them. 

For example, if you've used HTML tags in your variables which you subsequently want to echo, these get encoded to printable characters, so your HTML source appears as such in the browser display.
>How-To-Repeat:
Insert the following two lines in to a server-parsed file.

<!--#set var="foo" value="<h1>bar</h1>" -->
<!--#echo var="foo" -->

Then view it in a browser first using Apache 1.3.11 or below, then with 1.3.12.

Apache 1.3.11 and below will display "bar" as a heading type 1.
Apache 1.3.12 displays "<h1>bar</h1>" verbatim.
>Fix:
Either:

Change the line reading:

    encode = E_ENTITY;

to

    encode = E_NONE;

in line 5 of the handle_echo function in mod_include.c

OR

Add an option allowing the default encoding type to be set in httpd.conf.

 It is correct that the default has changed.  This is necessary for 
 security reasons related to the "cross site scripting" security problem.
 It is unlikely the default default will be changed.
 
 A config directive to change the default could perhaps be added,
 but in the vast majority of cases where people use mod_include, it
 is used to output something more than a static string.  In the
 majority of cases, this is based off some request variable that
 needs to be encoded.
