>Environment:
Win 98, VC 6.0, gcc 2.952
>Description:
I have a *very* basic CGI script written in C:
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        printf("Content-Type: text/plain\n\n");
        printf("Wibble!");
        return 0;
}
----
The problem is very simple - if I compile this with VC 6.0, and then attempt to execute the script via a web browser/apache, it works, and gives the expected output (Wibble! :o). However, if I compile it using gcc, it gives an internal server error, and the logfiles report "Premature end of script headers". 

I would think that the executable produced by gcc was faulty, but executing both programs from the command-line gives correct results (the http header, wibble), and it is only when attempting to use the gcc compiled program through apache that it fails.

State-Changed-Why:

Suppose this merits a patch.  Simply, gcc is printing
your header LF LF body, while win32 based apache is looking
for CRs as well.  Would think the CR's can be made optional.
