 Hello
 
  I have one problem one BSDI/4.1 with apache 1.3.12, in error_log :
 [Thu Sep 14 10:32:26 2000] [error] (57)Socket is not connected: getsockname
 [Thu Sep 14 10:32:26 2000] [error] (57)Socket is not connected: getsockname
 
  And the port 80 not responding, this problem is fix if you reinitialze the
 web  server.  You can help me ?
