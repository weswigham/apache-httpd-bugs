>Description:
Just built 1.2.4 and had one client accessing the httpd process. The correct 
IP for the client is 139.187.190.155. httpd is configured not to resolv 
hostnames. Below is the access_log that was generated from a few accesses.

>How-To-Repeat:
I assume that this is pretty repeatable on all platforms with no specific
URLs. My Configuration file can be sent if you need to rebuild a httpd 
to test again (if module conflicts are thought to be the issue).

State-Changed-Why:
I am very doubtful that this is caused by any bug in Apache.

Are you absolutely sure that there is no one else accessing
it?  Can you use tcpdump/snoop/etc. to sniff the network
to be sure there are no other requests?  Can you repeat
this?  Does the same thing happen with address resolution
enabled?

Are you sure you aren't going through any proxys?

Apache has no way to pull IP addresses out of thin air,
so you really should look closely at your environment to be
sure you aren't actually getting requests from the listed
hosts...
