>Environment:
Hardware: Intel Pentium II 350 / 256 MB RAM
Operating System: FreeBSD 2.2.8-RELEASE
Compiler: GCC 2.8.1
>Description:
The http server is running from inetd and tcp_wrappers (v 7.6).  
The server will randomly, instead of sending the requested document to the 
requesting browser, send a blank page with the words "Alarm clock."
This usually happens several times in succession, and then starts working 
again.  The server error logs do not show anything when this happens, nor 
does it leave a core file.
>How-To-Repeat:
Unknown.  http://www.arcanis.com and http://www.shadowmatrix.net are example 
URLs on the server that is experiencing the problem.

State-Changed-Why:
Why are you using inetd mode?

Why the heck won't anyone else in the apache group listen
to me when I say that inetd mode should be deprecated?
It's evil, broken, and never tested by anyone in the apache
group.

I suggest you use standalone mode.  Your problem will go
away.
