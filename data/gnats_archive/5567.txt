>Description:
An include like <!--#exec cmd="test.pl a b c"> does not work in a
user's public_html directory when using suexec.  The problem is
that suexec gets the cmd part as a single string, not broken on
spaces.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put the above tag in a server-parsed file.  suexec will attempt
to run a program named "test.pl a b c", which fails (and is
logged).
>Fix:
I patched suexec to split the command on spaces.  Since it is
very unusual to have actual commands that include spaces, this
should be okay.  My patch is available at (so it isn't munged
up by the web):
