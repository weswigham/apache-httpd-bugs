>Environment:
N/A - test-cgi script included by default
>Description:
test-cgi echos $CONTENT_TYPE unquoted. content type can be a user supplied variable if they telnet or use netcat to send

GET /cgi-bin/test-cgi HTTP/1.0
Content-type: *

they will get a directory listing of the cgi-bin
this is a well known bug and I am surprised to see the 'secure' distribution of 1.1.3 still has the test-cgi with this same hole.
>How-To-Repeat:
GET /cgi-bin/test-cgi HTTP/1.0
Content-type: *
>Fix:
put EVERYTHING that could possibly result in the accidental execution of other commands in quote

Fixed a long time ago in 1.2 by adding a set -f to
completely disable filename globbing.
