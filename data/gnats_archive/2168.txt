>Environment:
SunOS alanya.m.isar.de 5.6 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc
gcc 2.8.1
BIND 8.1.1
>Description:
On Solaris 2, the resolver routines are in -lresolv. BIND puts them
in -lbind. Since the header files are incompatible, using the
BIND 8.1.1 header files requires using -lbind. I have seen articles
in Sun newsgroups from people who did not understand quite often.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to check for this situation?

Or at least make configure accept --extra_libs=-lbind.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install BIND 8.1.1. Make sure the header files from this installation
are found before the original ones (resolv.h, arpa/inet.h).
Try a make. It will complain about undefined symbols __inet_addr
and __inet_ntoa.
>Fix:
Hmmm. I don't know autoconf.

State-Changed-When: Sat May  2 08:59:00 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

The problem with libbind my be address in a later version
of Apache. Currently we don't use autoconf, it's just
an autoconf-style interface.

Please read INSTALL and README.configure to find out
how you can pass extra variables (e.g. LDFLAGS) to
the configure script.
