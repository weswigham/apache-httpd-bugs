>Environment:
SunOS 4.1.4 sun4c
Compiler GCC version 2.7.2.3
>Description:
We are attempting to force the standard 'printenv' script to be executed as
cgi-script in a directory with static .html documents.  We do not want to
put an extension on the file.  We want to support this in a directory
.htaccess file.  When we use the rule 'RewriteRule ^printenv$ -
[T=application/x-httpd-cgi]', the RewriteLog shows it as just passing
through, not forcing the MIME-type.  When we use the rule 'RewriteRule
^printenv$ printenv [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]', the RewriteLog states the
URLs are egual and it will ignore the rewrite.  In both cases, it prints the printenv code and does not execute it.
>How-To-Repeat:
Copy standard 'printenv' script to a directory that is not set up with ScriptAlias or SetHandler, along with the other required options for RewriteRules.
Put in RewriteEngine on and either of the RewriteRules listed above.
Go to the URL which indicates your printenv script.  You should just get plain code.
>Fix:
This may be a configuration problem; however, we are following all the recommendations listed for RewriteRules.
The only suggestion off the top of my head is the problem has to do with the hook_mimetype function, but I haven't had to time to go through it in enough detail.

 Sorry to bother you.  I truly appreciate you clarifying this issue.  Just one
 other question.  Is there any way to force a single file to application/x-httpd-cgi?

 I don't understand what you mean? You reported the problem that one cannot
 force a single file to be application/x-httpd-cgi via RewriteRule.  I now
 fixed it for 1.3b7 by making sure "RewriteRule <pattern> - [T=<type>]"
 directives work as expected and now you ask me the question again if there is
 any way? Hmmm... do you mean in the meantime as workaround before 1.3b7 is
 available with my fix? Or do you mean for Apache 1.2? 
 
 Hmmm... there should be other tricks possible, perhaps:
 
 <Location ~ <pattern>>
 ForceType application/x-httpd-cgi
 </Location>

 I meant for Apache 1.2.  Sorry about the confusion.

 Thanks.  I used a <Files> section in my .htaccess.  This worked fine.  In fact,
 for our situation, this is probably the better way.  We might switch it to
 <FilesMatch> when we upgrade to 1.3 when it comes out for production, non-beta.
 
 Thanks for your assistance.
