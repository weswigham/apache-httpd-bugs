State-Changed-Why:
The warnings are due to the fact that Apahe does some things
that aren't nice for 64-bit systems; should still work though.

The error is beause, for some reason, your system doesn't
support shared memory.  Remove the HAVE_SHMGET line from
the LINUX section of conf.h and try recompiling.

by odd linux installation.
