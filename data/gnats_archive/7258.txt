>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows NT Workstation service pack 6 - Also occurrs on Windows 2000 Professional Service pack 1
>Description:
No dumps. Nothing in Error log. Access log shows only the page with the issue in it. Specifically the call is http://[server}:8080/{subdir}/{webpage}

That page contains:
<html>

<head>
<title>Apache Test Page</title>
<base target="main">
</head>

<body>
<pre>
This is a test of explicit CGI call via exec CGI
</pre>
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/Testexec2.rexx"  -->
</body>
</html>

Also have tried the exec as <!--#exec cgi="Testexec2.rexx"  -->

The HTTPD.conf file is pretty much default values except for server name and the ScriptInterpreterSource directive being turned on/off

I am using the Regina Rexx interpreter (available at http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/Regina/index.html), and I am encountering this error with both the ScriptInterpreterSource registry directive commented out and enabled.

The REXX exec is very simple. IT looks like this:
{#!E:/Regina/regina.exe - is the shebang line used when ScriptInterpreterSource is commented out)

/* rexx */
say "Content-type: text/html"
say
say '<H1>Hello, World!</H1>'
exit
>How-To-Repeat:
Please mail me for the specific URL to test this - as I do not want the entire universe playing with this server. 

Please note, I DID look through the bug list and didn't find anything that seemed to fit this particular problem. I saw stuff with perl scripts not accepting parameters etc. But this seemed a bit less complex than that. This problem is 'serious' from my perspective as it is preventing me from doing things in the simplest way possible. I could write everything to be server generated as the particular application is small, and invoke the main script via a meta refresh tag in a default page but I'd rather not do that if there is a fix
>Fix:
Um, I wish I did :)

<!--#exec cgi ... in almost all cases.

Thanks for using Apache!
