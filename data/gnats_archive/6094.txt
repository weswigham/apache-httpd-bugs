>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
AIX 4.2.1.0  JDK 1.1.8ga  JITC is off (Working on applying JDK1.1.8 patches but it is
a production system and there is normal BS...)  JServ 1.1
>Description:
JServ runs as a daemon process spawning children as needed to handle requests.   
Some of those spawned processes do not die.  I have had to create a cron entry
which kills JServ procs which are older than 4 minutes.  The Servlet tasks complete
with an average time of 2 seconds, longest is 30 seconds.
>How-To-Repeat:
Not sure...  Is there some debugging flags I can turn on to get 
you appropriate information?  This was occurring with apache 1.3.6 / Jserv 1.0 also.

>Fix:
I have not been able to reproduce the error in a test environment.  The test
environment mirrors production except for the amount of RAM and the volume of requests.
Any suggestions for debugging??

 Huh?
 
 JServ doesn't "spawn" any child processes. The C portion starts up a single
 instance of the JVM if you have ApJServManual "Off", that is it.
 
 This sounds like some sort of configuration error on your part. You didn't
 bother posting any configuration files, log files, or other relevant setup
 information so I'm not going to try to guess what is going wrong for you.
 :-)

 Cause for spawned process:
 One of the servlets calls the method Runtime.getRuntime() to execute a command line program.
 
 The error:
 An internally created shell script called 'jservctl' had the line:
 nohup /usr/local/jserv/bin/start >> /documents/log/nohup.log
 
 The /usr/local/jserv/bin/start script had the line:
 java org.apache.jserv.JServ jserv.properties &>> ${JSERV_LOGDIR}/jserv.log
 
 The fix:
 Removed the '&' sign from the start script line.  So now it looks like:
 java org.apache.jserv.JServ jserv.properties >> ${JSERV_LOGDIR}/jserv.log
