 Hello,
 
 Income opportunities for African-Americans have improved but not to the lev=
 els where we can safely say =93the glass ceiling=94 no longer exits.  There=
  are too many instances when the old clich=E9 =93the last to be hire and th=
 e first to be fired=94 turns out to be true.  Our slice of the American Dre=
 am is not what we would like it to be.  I would like to share with you a wa=
 y to supplement your current income and strengthen our communities without =
 interring with your present career; whereby, you could hedge your current f=
 inancial position with a turnkey income solution.
 
 I want to tell you about a company that has positioned itself to take advan=
 tage of "E-COMMERCE" like no other company in the world.  I'm writing to le=
 t you know that you are at the right place at the right time. The company t=
 hat I am talking about is Excel Communications, a nationally licensed commu=
 nications company that is expanding its product and service lines in the US=
 , Canada, and the United Kingdom. If you are open to making money from mark=
 eting services that people MUST USE EVERYDAY, (including Internet and E-Com=
 merce), and want to be a part of a winning team, read on. Simply put, you c=
 an make additional income with a limited time commitment, or you can make a=
  lifestyle career change.
 
 We market cutting edge, discounted communications products and services, an=
 d the PROFITS go to people like you and me instead of a few select sharehol=
 ders in corporate America. You will also own one of the largest shopping ma=
 lls on the Internet!
 
  Some facts you should know:
 
 1. Excel is the fourth largest communications company in North America righ=
 t behind AT & T, MCI, and Sprint.
 
 2. Excel was the youngest company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchan=
 ge in its 200 plus year history. Excel is also listed on the Toronto and th=
 e Montreal Stock Exchanges.
 
 3. Excel has the largest backbone of Internet Services in the world, and yo=
 u, as a Excel Representative, will own one of the largest shopping malls on=
  the Internet .(AOL is one of our customers).
 
 4. Excel reached a billion dollars in revenue in its 8th year. To put that =
 in perspective, it took Xerox 67 years, IBM 47 years, McDonalds 22 years, a=
 nd Microsoft 15 years to reach a billion dollars in revenue. INC. 500, 1996=
  Edition: "Excel makes famous INC. 500 alumnus Microsoft Corp. look sluggis=
 h by comparison."
 
 
 
 More importantly, you can use this income vehicle to help support any NPO (=
 non-profit organization) you maybe affiliated with.  The deregulation of pu=
 blic utilities provides a unique funding source for organizations to use fo=
 r their various projects and activates.   Every community has a pipeline of=
  communications and e-commerce services leading into it.  Unfortunately, th=
 e pipeline is then filled with huge dollars leaving the community as indivi=
 duals pay their monthly paging, Internet, wireless, long-distance and e-com=
 merce bills.  We have way to capture those monies and turn it into a revenu=
 e stream for the NPO.
 
 This is a strong business with serious income potential that will not inter=
 fere with your current schedule. After you have had a chance to review the =
 material at www.theanswerto.com/timefreedom, please call me at (877) 544-70=
 13 or email me at runee@exceloffice.net.
 
 Looking forward to hearing from you,
 
 Runee Harris
