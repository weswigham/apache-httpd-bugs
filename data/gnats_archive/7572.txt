>Description:
tried to make the standard 'allow ip-from-list or allow password'
authentication requirement.  however using an 'order deny,allow' (or
any order statement) silently breaks this, and password auth is
always required.


Since most folks explicitly use 'order', this behaviour is confusing
since we want to add this behaviour later, in general.
>How-To-Repeat:
The following config works:

<Directory /path/name>
        Deny from all
        Allow from ip_address

        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "whatever"
        AuthUserFile /tmp/pw
        Require valid-user

        Satisfy any
</Directory>

The following does not, it only includes an additional 'order'
statement:

<Directory /path/name>
        Order allow,deny
        Deny from all
        Allow from ip_address

        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "whatever"
        AuthUserFile /tmp/pw
        Require valid-user

        Satisfy any
</Directory>
>Fix:
An error msg or improved behaviour is a good idea, at minimum
a note in the docs should meantion this.

State-Changed-Why:

Hmmm... I think you should reread the documentation
for the Order directive.  Since you have
"Order Allow,Deny", the "Deny from all" will be
evaluated after the "Allow from xxx" and will
therefore deny all access.  The "Deny from all"
is not necessary in your configuration and should
be removed.

Thanks for using Apache!
