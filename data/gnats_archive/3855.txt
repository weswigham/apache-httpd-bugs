>Description:
<Directory /usr/www/apache/share/htdocs/users>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase   /users
RewriteRule   ^(.+)    http://w3.one.net/~$1 [R,L] 
</Directory>

This directive which used to rewrite http://w3.one.net/users/username to
http://w3.one.net/~username using the above in access.conf stopped working
after an upgrade. We have since replaced it with a RewriteRule in httpd.conf
but we were unable to get any rewrites inside <directory></directory> to even
be executed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the config directive in the previous box.	
>Fix:
RewriteRule   ^/users/(.+)     http://w3.one.net/~$1 [R,L]

we used the above to replace it
