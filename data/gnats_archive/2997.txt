Your web site
>Description:
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_cgi.html#scriptlog reports the context for ScriptLog as "resource config".
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directive-dict.html#Context does not define this context.
>How-To-Repeat:
go to http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_cgi.html#scriptlog
>Fix:
Cause the author of that page to verify his page on occasion, and perhaps define the context.

State-Changed-Why:

Thank you for the report.  The discrepancy comes from the
fact that the actual context granularity is somewhat finer,
and the 'context' description simplifies it.
