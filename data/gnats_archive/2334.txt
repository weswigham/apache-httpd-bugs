SunOS 5.6 (SPARC Solaris 2.6)
gcc 2.7.2.3
Apache v1.2.6 with JRun v2.1.2
JDK 1.1.6
Netscape Navigator 3.04 and 4.05
>Description:
I'm not sure if this is a JRun problem (I've sent them mail about it) or
an Apache problem.  A servlet that posts data to Apache is picked up in
mid-stream and results in corrupted data.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install JDK and Apache with JRun v2.1.2
You'll need to use an HTML page that uses ENCTYPE=multipart/form-data METHOD=post
Create a servlet that uploads a file to the server (I can provide my servlet, or you can use one included with JWS).
Try and submit the file, and output the lines you are receiving

State-Changed-Why:

I am almost certain that this is not an Apache problem,
but with your add-on servlet stuff.  You can try it on
Apache 1.3.1, but I don't expect you'll get any different
results.
