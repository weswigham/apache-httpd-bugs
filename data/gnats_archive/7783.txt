>Description:
I'm using Tomcat 3.3 with Apache 1.3.19.
I'm getting an emergency entry in my error log:
(2) No such file or directory: Error while opening the workers

The only place I've ever seen workers is with Tomcat, but the workers.properies
file is in place an configured properly.

This error comes from a Java program that is used to invoke Tomcat, then
Apache.  However, when I run the same commands (i.e. apachectl start) from the
command line, there is no problem whatsoever.
>How-To-Repeat:
Write a script that updates parameters in workers.properties in Tomcat as well
as httpd.conf and apachectl.  In the same script, kick off Tomcat and Apache.
>Fix:
No.

 I have found that this problem is on Solaris 2.8 and not on NT.  A work-around
 that has been effective is to wait until Tomcat creates mod_jk.conf-auto before
 kicking off Apache.  Apparently, the file locking semantics to support Java file
 access do not work on Solaris 2.8 like one would expect.  In particular, when
 one calls file.close() (e.g. after updating the Tomcat file), any subsequent
 call that one makes (e.g. to kick off Apache) assumes that the file exists, is
 not locked, and is available for use.  This does not seem to be the case.
