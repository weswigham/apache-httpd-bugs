Hi i get following error when I try to install Apache:
Warning: The TCP/IP networking protocol or the WinSock2 update were not successfully detected on this PF: Until thil problem is corrected, Apache installation cannot continue reliable. Assure TCP/IP networking is configured correctly. Windows 95 users must install the WinSock2 update available at.....

This happened on two PC's and on one Laptop, all with the same enviroment. I'm sure that it can't be that all three have the TCP/IP protocol not correctly configured.

Please help me to solve this problem, because when I install ist further half of the Apace is missing...

State-Changed-Why:

Please see http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/
instead... I strongly suspect you found a misplaced, test
distribution (that was purged) in /dist/httpd/ where it
never belonged.

The correct file is apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.msi, it does
_NOT_ end in *src.msi.  Please download the correct file
and try again, see TROUBLESHOOTING first in binaries/win32/
if you have problems before opening a new report with any
further troubles you might encounter.
