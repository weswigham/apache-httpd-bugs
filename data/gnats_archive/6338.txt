>Environment:
Solaris 8, gcc 2.95.2 (though it isn't really relevant here)
>Description:
The configure script is a bourne shell script, and as such the eqaulity tests should be '=' not '==' as they are in the case of 2.0a4 - changing all(?) instances of '==' to '=' fixes the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just ./configure I suppose :)
>Fix:
Replace '==' with '='!
