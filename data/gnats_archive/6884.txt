Even all servlet class files are on write place










>How-To-Repeat:
http://172.25.8.151:83/ipac_svlt/manage (Its Interanet problem)
Manage is a servlet.
When we call  any perl file it displays but in case of servlet it shows internal server error.

 found and even apache server not started.

 problem?
 Our setup is apache-web-server 1.3.9 and jserv-1.0.

Comment-Added:

I am sorry, but there are two reasons why I can't
answer your question:
1. This is the wrong forum.  This database is designed
only for reporting bugs in the Apache HTTP Server.
You have not found a bug.  Rather, you have a problem
configuring your server.  We do not have the resources
necessary to answer configuration questions.
2. You have not provided nearly enough information
to even start determining what might be wrong.

Please don't take this as an invitation to provide
more information.  Instead, you should seek out 
another forum, such as the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix newsgroup,
or one of the java apache mailing lists.
Thanks for using Apache!
