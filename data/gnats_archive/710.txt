>Description:
  Requests for a particular IP address, as defined in <VirtualHost>
directives, are ignored if the ServerName within the directive does
not match the browser's request!  That is, IP-based virtual hosts do
not work properly -- They are matched according to non-IP host rules.
This causes a big problem for browsers that do not supply the server
name in their request, and for browsers reaching the site via one of
its aliases, such as "site.com" in lieu of "www.site.com".

DNS configuration:
------------------
persiankitty.com      A  209.81.0.2
                      A  209.81.0.3

www.persiankitty.com  A  209.81.0.2
                      A  209.81.0.3

www.pay4play.com      A  209.81.0.6
pay4play.com          A  209.81.0.6

  A request for 209.81.0.2, with a supplied matching servername of
"www.persiankitty.com" gets set to the right VirtualHost.  The same
IP request, with a non-matching name of "persiankitty.com" does not
get processed by IP -- it goes to the default host.  A ServerAlias
directive might help this, but that still leaves a problem:  An IP
request, with NO servername specified by the browser, does not get
processed by IP -- it goes to the default host also.  Enabling and
monitoring logs proves my conclusion.
  As a test, I removed the "ServerName" directive from <VirtualHost>.
In that instance, requests with NO servername specified went to the
correct VirtualHost.  However, requests with either name specified
went to the default host.  Consistent with my theory.
  This applies to any of the IP addresses my systems hosts.  This
same behavior is seen on all three of my server machines!!!

ifconfig fxp0

>How-To-Repeat:
Simple!!  Go to http://209.81.0.6/ and then to www.pay4play.com --
both should send you to the same virtual host, but they don't !!
>Fix:
Clean up non-IP based virtual hosting code, which seems to have
bled into IP-based virtual hosting code

State-Changed-Why:
While the current virtual host code could be argued to
be broken and it isn't pretty or easy to understand how
it works, I think the problem you are having is a result
of your configuration.

You are telling Apache that _both_ the main server and
a virtualhost are supposed to be www.persiankitty.com.
That doesn't make any sense and confuses Apache.  You
can not have both the main server and a virtual host
answer to the same IP address, which is what you are doing
by giving them both the same ServerName.

See http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts-in-depth.html for
an explaination of some of your problems.  Fix that, and
the rest may or may not work.  The pay4play one is the only
one for which it isn't apparent why it is behaving how it
is.  Clean up the others first and see if it starts working
properly.

 It goes to the "main server" because you've defined the main server to be
 www.persiankitty.com, and so the VirtualHost is considered a name-based
 (i.e. HTTP/1.1) virtualhost.  One option is to use <VirtualHost _default_>
 for the persiankitty server.  Another option is to use "ServerName
 localhost" as the global servername... since you don't want to serve hits
 from the global server (at least it doesn't sound like you want to), then
 you should probably just use _default_. 
 
 Another option is to not use the ip address of the server itself (which
 I'm assuming is 209.81.0.2).

State-Changed-Why:
Virtualhosts are hopelessly broken (in my opinion) in 1.2 and 1.1
for certain cases.  You seem to be tickling one of them.  But I've
never seen a setup that couldn't be solved by using the following
(non-inuitive) config:

ServerName localhost
<VirtualHost a.b.c.1>
ServerName www.virtualhost1.com
...
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost a.b.c.2>
ServerName www.virtualhost2.com
....
</VirtualHost>

In short, don't use the "global" or "main" server at all, stick
everything in virtualhosts.  Then fool Apache into thinking that
the main server's address is 127.0.0.1, which is an address you're
quite unlikely to try serving as a virtualhost.

If that doesn't do the job then tell me and I'll re-open the
PR.
