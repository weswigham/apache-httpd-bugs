>Description:
If you try to upload a ASCII file with POST method, the file contents can be read.

However, if you try to upload a binary file with the POST method, problem is found.

The CONTENT_LENGTH environment variable seems to be correct, but the server
closes the input stream before i get all the contents of the file.
Besides, the boundary of the binary file cannot be found.
>How-To-Repeat:
Just write a HTML and a script to upload and read the upload file.

 One... you don't identify which version of Apache (1.3.what?)
 
 Second... you may have forgotten to change the read mode of stdin
 to binary data.  Graphics and other files contain NULL characters,
 and if you script isn't handling the data as raw, it will be 
 corrupted on it's way up.  Also, most languages mangle cr/lf line
 termination unless the stdin stream is set to raw (or binary) mode.
 
 Try these things before I even give this a whack.  I've tested every
 version from 1.3.9 through 1.3.12, they all worked.
