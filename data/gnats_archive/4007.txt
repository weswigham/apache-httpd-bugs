Windows'98
no c-compiler
I have Delphi 4 CS
>Description:
Can I run CGI scripts on my windows machine without recompiling te sources ???
I don't have a C compiler and my Borland MAKE does not work with this source, it gives a lot of errors and I don't understand C....

I would like to test CGI and PHP3 pages on my local computer, so that I can upload them to my website at the server of my provider...

My provider runs a Apache server (XS4All in the Netherlands (www.xs4all.nl) 
and my webhost provider runs a WN server ;o(

If I can test local, I'm very happy and saves a lot of money for phonecosts...
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know....
>Fix:
Maybe to make the win32 set so that I can test CGI's without recompiling ????

Thank you,

Greetings...

Richard...
