Apache complains about DBM file not found. 

The problem is not Apache. It is the gdbm library (1.7.3). Apache calls dbm_open
in gdbm which in turn adds the ".pag" and ".dir" extensions to the filename 
before opening the file. The perl script (dbmmanage) included will work with the
file because Perl calls the other function in gdbm (which is gdbm_open).
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile Apache with mod_auth_dbm and try to access the file. The error_log
will show that Apache is not able to find the file.
>Fix:
1. Recompile gdbm library and comment out the ".pag" and ".dir" extensions.

2. Maybe Apache can call the actual function ( gdbm_open ) which gdbm itself
   calls.

3. Make symbolic links to your dbm file eg.
    ln -s mydbmfile mydbmfile.dir
    ln -s mydbmfile mydbmfile.pag

 If I may butt in here....
 
    This is PR 2809.
 
 
 >> The problem is not Apache. It is the gdbm library (1.7.3).
 
    This is not correct.
 
    I am having the same problem (Apache 1.3.3).  auth_dbm *did* work
 when I first tested it, but now fails.   I am now building in mod_perl,
 which I was not doing previously.
 
    My suspicion is that, since I include GDB< with perl, the addition of
 -lgdm to the compile options is having a detrimental affect.
 
    NOTE: That I am having exactly the same probelm on both Solaris2.6
 and irix6.2 systems.  The Apache server succesfully opens the .pag file,
 reads from it, *then* reports "File not found" (checked with truss and
 par respectively).
 
 >> >Fix:
 >> 1. Recompile gdbm library and comment out the ".pag" and ".dir" extensions.
 
    Thsi is not a fix.  I am not using gdbm (at least I shouldn't be).  I
 *should* be using ndbm (and certainly was when I first tested it, as I
 made my test files with makedbm - they still have the YP stamps in
 them).
