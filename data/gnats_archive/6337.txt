>Description:
In a servlet, POST data is truncated to about 10K when it is posted over a 
network. When the form is submitted locally, no truncation occurs.

This truncation occurs when the data is slightly larger than 10K. When it is
much larger (20K) the servlet isn't even run (the log shows a message that it
couldn't read servlet headers).

NOTE: This problem DOESN'T occur right after the machine has been rebooted.
The first request is handled correctly, but all succeding requests are mangled.
>How-To-Repeat:
The Java code for the servlet that produces this problem can be accessed from

http://vorpal.mcs.drexel.edu/postExam.java

To see the problem, fill out the form 

http://vorpal.mcs.drexel.edu/course/gui/exam.html

Required fields are first and last name (put anything), student ID (put 0) and email
(put anything with an @-sign in it), section (click on graduate or undergraduate). 
Now fill out the answers with a lot of text copied from anywhere and click on
submit. This is supposed to bring up a screen where you can check your answers 
before entering them into the database.

If you enter a lot of text in each answer, the servlet won't even run.  If you 
enter too much text (but close to the threshhold) the servlet will truncate your
answers.

If you enter a small amount of text in each answer (one line or so), the servlet will
function properly.
>Fix:
I haven't the faintest idea! I dread going back to CGI scripts for this, but it
looks as though I'll have to (when 30 students submitted the exam at the same
time, my machine choked --- Unfortunately this servlet has a problem with only 
one person entering an exam).
