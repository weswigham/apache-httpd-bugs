OS : Solaris 8 (Sparc)
Compiler : gcc 2.95.3
Module : auth_mysql 2.20
MySQL : mysql-3.23.48-sun-solaris2.8-sparc
>Description:
Here is the configure line :
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max --activate-module=src/modules/auth_mysql/libauth_mysql.a

No error message during this step.
modules are built, libauth_mysql.a is built but make crashes during the final step (httpd building):

gcc  -I/usr/local/mysql/include  -DSOLARIS2=280 -DMOD_SSL=208106 -DEAPI -DEAPI_MM -DUSE_EXPAT -I./lib/expat-lite `./apaci` -L/usr/local/mm/lib   \
      -o httpd buildmark.o modules.o modules/auth_mysql/libauth_mysql.a modules/standard/libstandard.a main/libmain.a ./os/unix/libos.a ap/libap.a  lib/expat-lite/libexpat.a  -L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient   -lsocket -lnsl -lpthread -lmm -ldl

compress                            /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.a(my_compress.o)
ld: fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to httpd

gmake[1]: *** [build-std] Error 2
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/local/src/apache_1.3.23'
gmake: *** [build] Error 2

If I remove --activate-module=src/modules/auth_mysql/libauth_mysql.a from the configure line, make is working fine.

State-Changed-Why:

You're going to need to specify some EXTRA_LIBS for the
build process.  But since this is a mod_mysql problem,
you really need to go to the distributers of that 
module for support and documentation.

Thanks for using Apache.
