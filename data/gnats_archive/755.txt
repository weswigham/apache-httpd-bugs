>Description:
1.2.0 complains of:
httpd: cannot determine the IP address of the specified ServerName
(www.pavilion.co.uk).

It does this when the number of virtual servers is > 124.  At 124
it runs but doesn't service connections.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I assume that this is an O/S limit, but I don't know which one.

I've run the 'httpd' from an entirely unlimited shell:
dougal# unlimit
dougal# limit
cputime         unlimited
filesize        unlimited
datasize        131072 kbytes
stacksize       65536 kbytes
coredumpsize    unlimited
memoryuse       unlimited
memorylocked    unlimited

I've also recompiled the FreeBSD kernel to include:

maxusers        256

# joe/pavilion/19970529: Our machines have 96Mb of memory
options         "MAXMEM=96*1024"

# joe/pavilion/19970619: jungled the maximum number of connections
options         SOMAXCONN=1024

This should be plenty, but I still have this problem.
