>Description:
I have been using the SERVER_SUBVERSION to indicate compilation and other
SHORT misc information for my own use as I maintain a number of sites.  
I notice that unlike 1.3b6 and before, that this define has been removed, 
there seems to be NO way to add now add a STATIC identifier at compile time.  
There is a reference to calling a subroutine but that looks like more 
for add-on modules, a good thing I know, but still you need to provide
a compile time unchanging local identifier.  I am not in-favor of a 
Run-Time directive here for this field as I do not want it changing.

My only choice seems to be to edit the appropriate os.h file.  DRAG
>How-To-Repeat:
No problem
>Fix:
Return SERVER_SUBVERSION variable to the httpd.h file OR generate some 
way to change it at "configure" time.

State-Changed-By: Lars.Eilebrecht@unix-ag.org
State-Changed-When: Thu May 28 14:08:55 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

After a long discussion we decided to remove the
SERVER_SUBVERSION in favour of the new API call
ap_add_version_component(), because only modules
should add information to the Server: header.

The Server: header is not the right place to add
private tokens.

You can always use mod_headers to add custom headers
to a server response.

 Use mod_headers and create another header with your comment.  Or write a
 module to add your comments.  I don't see why we need to support Server
 modifications for folks who don't change the code at all.

 If you're modifying the server anyhow then it's trivial for you to do
 this.  If you're not modifying the server, I don't see what the need is.

 If you modify the code, then it is easy enough to add a call to the new
 API function in the code to add whatever it is you need.

 You have a point ...and yes it is trivial to add.  My only complaint
 is that it was removed in the first place and now I have to add it
 back via my own internal patching.  I have been trying to do a little
 of this as possible as the entire Apache server contained everything
 I needed.  *sigh* :-)
 
 Ok...I see the opinion is pretty well established against this
 change.  
 
 Therefore, please close this change-request.
