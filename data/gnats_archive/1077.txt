SCO Open Server 5.0.4
GCC 2.7.2
>Description:
To get ELF output, on the src/Configure script, around line 379
(SCO5 section) change
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DSCO5"
  LIBS="$LIBS -lsocket -lmalloc -lprot"
to
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -belf -DSCO5"
  LFLAGS="$LFLAGS -belf"
  LIBS="$LIBS -lsocket -lmalloc -lprot -ltinfo -lm -lx"

SIGURG is defined on SCO5. To avoid a compilation warning,
add #ifndef SIGURG .. #endif to the SIGURG declaration
on src/conf.h line 280.
