>Description:
When using multiviews to display different language pages depending on the
browser settings, no fallback language can be defined, i.e. if no document for
the desired language is available, only an error page can be displayed. This
breaks frame-based page layouts and scares off the average user.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
RFC 2616 says: "HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are not
acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request. In some cases,
this may even be preferable to sending a 406 response."
[http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.7]

So, just add a configuration directive like "FallbackLanguage" which indicates
the language that should be served instead of an error document if no acceptable
language version of a document is available on the server. This should be an 
optional configuration directive. If omitted, the default "Not Acceptable" page
should be generated.

State-Changed-Why:

A new directive will be added for this purpose in the 2.0
version.  It will not likely appear in 1.3.

There is a workaround:
If you inlude a file with no language in the negotiation,
then Apache will use this when the negotiation fails.
For example, inlude a document with the extension
.html.html
