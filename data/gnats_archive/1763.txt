>Description:
From a browser, accessing the url
www.bzs.org/Diabetes/

results in index.shtml being recognized correctly.
However, clicking on a directory index generated by apache into
another directory that contains "index.shtml" results in a generated
index rather than using "index.shtml"
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes,
www.bzs.org/Diabetes/
click on members only
use "apache@dummy.org" as the password
click on 'mail'
click on any month - you will get a dir listing instead of index.shtml
>Fix:
Nope, I'm a 'C' dummy

Are you sure something like

  DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html

is defined in your configuration?

 Yes, it is.  aaaahhhh. but the solution is (unfortunatly) a dumb 
 newbie mistake.  I have a 
 DirectoryIndex 
 directive in a preceeding directory.  It appears (from reading docs) 
 that this automagicaly propagates to following directories.
 
 This site is a mirror of a site on a non-apache (ISP) webserver that 
 I think is ncsa based.  The 'DirectoryIndex' does not propagate to 
 following directories on that machine and I just naturally assumed it 
 would be the same on my Apache server.
 
 Sorry for the newbie panic.
 
 If you have any insight into the above I would appreciate your 
 comments.
 
 Michael

 Yes, that's how the <Directory> sections are implemented.

 As far as I know the NCSA server should do the same if there's a
 DirectoryIndex directives inside a <Directory> section. If it does
 not it's a bug.
