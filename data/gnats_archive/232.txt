>Description:
For certain jpeg images, Apache 1.2b7/b8 causes Netscape 3.0.1 to display a "broken"
image.  The jpeg is fine and displays fine when transferred, directly via ftp
to a server running Apache 1.0.5 (blush).  The image is displayed correctly
using IE 3.0.  I imagine this is a problem with Netscape barfing on some
HTTP/1.1 responses, for some reason.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.enews.com/graphics/covers/arthritis.jpg will not display under
3.0.1, for mac or windows '95.  It will display under IE.

 Wow.  Amazing.  Astounding.
 
 Looks like a bug in Netscape, both 3.x and 4.0b2 under Unix.  If I add a:
 	
 	#define SERVER_SUBVERSION "mod_perl/0.94"
 
 to my httpd.h I can reproduce it easily.  Changing SERVER_SUBVERSION to
 "h" made things work, so perhaps it is the / causing problems.
 
 So, a workaround should be to remove however mod_perl adds the mod_perl
 bit to the server name.  A fix is to beat Netscape over the head until
 they fix it.  Quite an odd problem.

State-Changed-Why:

We have included a workaround for this Netscape bug in 1.2b9-dev.
Navigator 1.2 through 4.0b2 have a header parsing bug.
If the terminating empty-line CRLF occurs starting
at the 256th or 257th byte of output, then Navigator will think a normal
image is invalid.  We are guessing that this is because their initial
read of a new request uses a 256 byte buffer. We check the bytes written
so far and, if we are about to tickle the bug, we instead insert a
padding header of eminent bogosity.
