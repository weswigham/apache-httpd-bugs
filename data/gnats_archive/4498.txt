>Description:
I created this small Turbo Pascal 7 program:

  begin writeln('Content-type: text/plain');writeln;writeln('Hi) end.

named it cgi1.pas, compiled it to cgi1.exe and put it in 
  
  C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\cgi-bin

When executed as a CGI, the server responded with a 500 error.

Error log:

  [Mon May 31 16:43:40 1999] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Premature end of 
  script headers: c:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/cgi1.exe

Script log:

  %% [Mon May 31 16:43:40 1999] GET /cgi-bin/cgi1.exe HTTP/1.1
  %% 500 c:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/cgi1.exe
  %request
  Accept: application/vnd.ms-excel, application/msword, */*
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  Accept-Language: en-us
  Connection: Keep-Alive
  Host: localhost
  User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 98)
  %response

The problem disappears if I put cgi1.exe under some short, dos8.3-compatible
path:

  in httpd.conf:
  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin2/ "c:/cgi-bin/"

CGI scripts (e.g. perl scripts) work fine in all cases, even when I put
perl in some LFN path like c:/perl directory/bin/perl.exe
