>Description:
I'm developing some cgi programs using perl5.002, and sybperl 2.07 and am having very unpredictable behavior from the httpd server. noe perl errors or problems appear when these programs are run from the command line, however, when I run them from the Web browser, I get numerous 'malformed header from script' errors.
