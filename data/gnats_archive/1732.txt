>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0, SP3, MS Dev Studio, SP3
>Description:
The proxy reroutes URLs with Uppercase chracters in it, completely as lowercase.
Case sensitive servers react as if the requested URL can not be found.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow http://www.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html from a browser which has a 1.3b3
version on win32 as proxy.
>Fix:
removing 
   strlwr(buf);
from
   src/os/win32/util_win32.c
works for me
