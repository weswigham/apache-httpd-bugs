>Environment:
AIX 4.1.4, with IBM C Set++ compiler
>Description:
This works in by 1.2.5 server access.conf file:

<Files "*.pl">
Options ExecCGI
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Registry
</Files>

But 1.3b3 and 1.3b5 both seem to ignore this. If I instead use

<FilesMatch "\.pl$">

It works, there's nothing in the compatibility notes about this so I expected
that this should still work.

State-Changed-Why:
The new-for-1.3 <FilesMatch> directive is *not* a direct
replacement for <Files "pattern">, but for the regex
format, <Files ~ "pattern">.  "*.pl" is a shell pattern,
not a regex one.  Continue to use <Files> for shell
pattern matching.

Thanks for using Apache!

State-Changed-Why:
Ken he's saying that <Files> doesn't behave the same way between
1.2 and 1.3, and he's right.  In 1.3 the wildcard patterns
were changed so that they follow sh-like rules and * doesn't
match /.  Unfortunately <Files> has always matched against the
full pathname.  I believe that is what we should change --
<Files> should match the basename only.  Then we document this
change in the upgrading document.

Patch committed to 1.3b6-dev.  You've got a workaround for now
so I won't bother including the patch.
