State-Changed-Why:

Apache is tuned and supported on the WinNT platforms
(including 2000) - 9x and ME consumer OS's are incidental.

However, just such an incidental change may occur with the
release of 1.3.13, and likely with the release of 2.0.
Please try either version as it is released, or you are
also welcome to download the sources and compile Apache
using the MS C++/Developer's studio versions 5.0 or 6.0.

We adopted the Microsoft system installer packaging as of
Apache 1.3.14, so these problems have evaporated
