>Environment:
Windows NT 4.0 SP3
MSVC++ 5.0 SP3
>Description:
When building the installr version of Apache for windows the server will start
and only handle a couple of requests before exiting.  No error messages are 
loged in the event logs.  If I rebuild the source using the installd version of
the source the server will run without fail.

This server is being brough up as a Mod_perl only site.  All requests are being
serviced using mod_perl.  It does not make a difference if mod_perl is built
using release or debug mode.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build the server using installr and try to get it to run.  You may need to have
mod_perl installed as well.
>Fix:
Build the server using installd.

 Please try it without mod_perl and see if you see the same issues.
 
 It is possible this is a mod_perl issue.
