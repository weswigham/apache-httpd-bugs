SunOS trout 5.5 Generic_103093-14 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5

>Description:
Using the following directives:

<Directory proxy:*>
AuthType Basic
AuthName Authorised Proxy Users Only
AuthUserfile /somefile
require valid-user
</Directory>

Authorisation is requested, I type in my user name and password and then I am told authorisation failed.

However, changing proxy:* to a local file, authorisation works fine.

I've checked and double-checked that I am typing the correct password every time.

I want to be able to restrict access to the proxy to only selected users, and I can't.

And what shows up in the error log?

You really need to upgrade to 1.3b2; we can't support
old betas, and especially not old alphas.

 I appreciate that.  Sorry.  I will endeavour to do this next week.
 
 Is there a debug switch I can turn on to see what it's trying to do with the
 authentication message from the browser?
 
 Cheers
