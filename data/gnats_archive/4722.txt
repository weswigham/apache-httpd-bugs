>Environment:
1.3.6 Win32 
March 23, 1999 Build
Windows 98 (NOT TESTED ON NT)
>Description:
Apache -S  (that's a capital S) 
Documentation states: 
-S 
Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only shows a breakdown of the vhost settings) but do not start the server. (Up to Apache 1.3.3, this option also started the server). 

 -- Bug: does start the server in Win 98.

Compare:
Apache -s (small s)
starts the server (as expected for Win32) without
the info about vhost settings (also as expected)
>How-To-Repeat:
at Dos prompt, type:
Apache -S   ###capital S ####
(in a win95/98 environment)
>Fix:
no

Fixed in 1.3.7
