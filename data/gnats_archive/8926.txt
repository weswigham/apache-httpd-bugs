Digital UNIX 4.0D/F, using native CC

uname -a = "OSF1 Uprava.ev.co.yu V4.0 878 alpha"
>Description:
DEC CC cannot work with C (*.h or *.c) source code which contains indented CPP directives, such as:

#ifdef THIS_OR_THAT
  #include <some_header.h>
#endif

I have looked at C language specifications and all I could get (K&R c and ANSII C) state that "#" MUST start in column 1 of the line, the rest of the directive may be indented. Thus, this would be OK:

#ifdef THIS_OR_THAT
#  include <some_header.h>
#endif
And the above change works.

In Apache, not only "configure" script uses this (APR, detection of INT64_C in <stdint.h>), but it is present in several instances of source itself.

I can change this by hand, but it gets tiresome after a couple of times.

Is this a GNU CC speciality or is it a new part of C Language specification?

In other words, should I bother you or Compaq?

Nix.
>How-To-Repeat:
Get a DEC CC for Alpha, or try ANSI CC. Unless there was a change in ANSI specification, it should produce an error or a warning while compiling the simplest example.
>Fix:
Do not indent CPP directives. I know it makes things more readable, but CPP language is not a part of C language, strictly speaking.

Or at least follow what ANSI says, "keep # in the first column, but indent the rest of the CPP directive".

Nix.
