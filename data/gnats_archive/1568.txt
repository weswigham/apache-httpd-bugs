>Description:
I am attempting a new Apache port to a posix compatible OS.  The conf.h contains setup parameters for presently available Apache ports.  The conf.h module preface indicates that the meaning of the parameters in the module are explained in a "readme" file.  Thau's "readme" in the source directory makes no mention of the conf.h parameters.  Searched documentation and couldn't find definitions of parameters in conf.h file for Apache build.  
Does the Apache group encourage new ports of Apache?

Thanks for your help.

State-Changed-Why:
Many of them are described in the PORTING file; the comment
in conf.h will be fixed.

I am sure there are many missing from PORTING; if you run into
any specific ones that caused you extra pain let us know.

We do encourage ports, however we are often unable to offer
much in the way of assistence without access to the platform.
Also note that, as long as the changes are reasonable,
Also note that changes have a lot better chance of being
integrated into the main distribution when done
against the latest 1.3 beta tree.
