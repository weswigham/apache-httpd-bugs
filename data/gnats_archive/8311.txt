>Release:        1.3.20
>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Using Win2K professional-no known patches (whatever was installed with the computer as of May 2001
>Description:
Did a installation trace as instructed (and removed the nulls).
Most recent log is available at http://www.arrowsmithweb.com/debug.txt

>How-To-Repeat:
Installed Apache a few months ago - had problems - removed the files.
Tried to install it again and the package said it was already insatlled.
Tried to uninstall it but the files were long gone (removed).
Hacked the registry (safely) to remove all references to the program.
Re-ran the installer and got "Internal error 2755. 1632" error.

Ran the installation log generator and saw that I had missed removing some  references that the installer was finding, so I removed the mentioned registry keys until the installation did not find any (except the (null) at the bottom - whatever THAT means.

Same error.
>Fix:
Maybe there is something in the registry left over that I missed.  What does a successful installation log look like?  How do I know what is wrong with the installation by reading the logs?
