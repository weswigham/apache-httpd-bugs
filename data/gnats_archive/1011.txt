Linux web2 1.2.1 #10 Mon Jul 1 05:36:57 EDT 1996 i586
>Description:
perl and sh CGIs do work. and the csh script works under apache .8.14 on
the same box, and under a 1.2 b10 on a different linux box running linux 2.0.

the error message seems to indicate that for some reason the CGI handler
is looking for a $home variable?  here's the error log entry

No $home variable set.
[Mon Aug 18 16:32:36 1997] access to /home/jay/public_html/test.cgi
failed for nemesis.syrres.com, reason: Premature end of script headers

here's the script

#!/bin/csh
echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo ""
echo "<HTML>"
echo "test"
echo "</html>\n"
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.syracuse.ny.us:8080/~jay/test.cgi if you insist on seeing it crash :)

i can produce the same error message on the command line if i unset the HOME
environment variable lihe this:

web2> test.cgi
Content-type: text/html

<HTML>
test
</html>

web2> unsetenv HOME
web2> test.cgi
No $home variable set.

 csh absolutely sucks as a scripting language.  You shouldn't use it.  I
 think you have discovered your own problem though:

 Your script is running your .cshrc or some crud like that.  Hardly a
 friendly thing to be doing.  If you're dead set on using csh then you
 should change the first line to: 
 
 #!/bin/csh -f

As Dean said, one of your .cshrc or similar files is

Not an Apache problem.

 still doesn't make sense (details below)
 
 i wouldn't be so quick to call this "not an Apache problem", since it ONLY
 appears in 1.2.1. i currently have .8.14 running on the same box on a different
 port and the same script runs fine. so at the minimum, if this isn't a PROBLEM
 per se, there is some difference in how the two versions handle the CGI

 agreed. in fact i don't really care about the csh script (its an old hack i
 wrote before i learned of the wonders of perl), but i'm concerned about the
 fact that this version of apache doesn't behave the same as the earlier version
 running on the same box. thought it might be a sign of bigger problems to
 come...

 i already tried this. no dice. my server is running as "nobody", and there are
 no associated .cshrc or .login files. i tried changing the User and Group to an
 existing non-privileged user, but that didn't make a difference either. i also
 tried removing the system-wide /etc/csh.cshrc and /etc/csh.login files
 
 anyway, for now i'm going to ditch the csh script and see how it goes...
 
 thanks
