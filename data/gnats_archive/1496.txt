windows 95
>Description:
I performed a "full" installation for win95 (in fact I tried 3 times). Installation looks perfect, no remarks, no complaints. After start-up following message was shown manifestly:

Apache/1.3b3
fopen: No such file or directory
httpd: could not open document config file /apache/conf/httpd.conf

Nevertheless, the mentioned httpd.conf file does exist, and in the right directory...

As far as I could find out there is no trouble report available right know...

State-Changed-Why:
Apache installs itself into \Program Files\Apache by
default. However when it starts it assumes that its
server-root is in \apache. You either have to start Apache
with the -d option to tell it the installed location
(i.e. apache -d "\Program Files\Apache", or copy 
\Program Files\Apache to \apache. In the later case you
will also have to update the files in \apache\conf with
the new directory locations for ServerRoot and
DocumentRoot.
