Mac OS X 10.1.3 (Darwin). December 2001 Apple Developer tools.
>Description:
Given "bob.com"... If I request "http://bob.com/", the index.shtml file that is displayed is not parsed before being sent out. If I request "http://bob.com/index.shtml" it works fine. Any subdirectories that I put into the request path do not parse the index files unless I explicity refer to the file. I have messed with the config file for hours and read all the documentation I could find on the subject. I can't make it work for anything.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a new 2.0b32 web server. Set it up to use SSI on .shtml documents. Pretend the domain is "bob.com". If I request "http://bob.com/", the index.shtml file that is displayed is not parsed before being sent out. If I request "http://bob.com/index.shtml" it works fine. Any subdirectories that I put into the request path do not parse the index files unless I explicity refer to the file.
>Fix:
Nope. Is this related at all to whether or not you enable Indexes? Should it be?
