>Description:
  I tested with lots of different AddIconByEndcoding entries, but
  it seems that the entries are simply ignored (eg. the icons or alt
  texts don't appear in a directory index).

  Examples:
   AddIconByEncoding (DOC,/icons/layout.gif) pdf html
   AddIconByEncoding (TXT,/icons/tex.gif) x-tex

  I commented out all other AddIcon* directives in srm.conf, but
  all AddIconByEncoding directives I tested are ignored, except one
  "AddIconByEncoding (CMP,/icons/compressed.gif) x-gzip" and I'm
  really wondering why this works but the others not...

  AddIconByType and AddIcon works without any problems.

  (Yes, fancy indexing was activated during my tests. :-))

 Umm... html, etc. are not normally encodings ("Content-Encoding") but
 rather are media types ("Content-Type").  You may have:
 
 	AddEncoding x-compress Z
 	AddEncoding x-gzip gz
 
 in your config file, which explains why x-gzip may work because it is an
 encoding.  AddIconByType, as the default config file has, is what you want
 for mime types.
 
 Is there some errant documentation somewhere that suggests
 AddIconByEncoding should work for anything other than Content-Encodings?
