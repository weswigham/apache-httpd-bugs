>Environment:

Problem occurs both on:
Redhat 6.1 and Blackdown JDK 1.2.2 AND 
NT 4.0 with Sun JDK 1.2.2 
>Description:

The signal() method in JServ.java always attempts to connect to JServ
at 127.0.0.1 and does not use the address specified in the configuration
file.

A server in manual mode listening on another address cannot be
shutdown.  When the shutdown command is issued, the program
running the shutdown command throws an exception (JServ.java:485)
because it cannot connect to the server at that address.

A workaround, of course, is to use 127.0.0.1 as the bind address but
this isn't practical for all environments.

>How-To-Repeat:

Reproduce the problem by starting a JServ server on an address other
than 127.0.0.1 and have the server in Manual mode.

Try issuing the shutdown command and notice the exception thrown.
>Fix:

On line 487 of JServ.java we have:
  socket = new AuthenticatedSocket("127.0.0.1", port, new MD5(), s
ecret);

And on line 493 we have:
  socket = new AuthenticatedSocket("127.0.0.1", port);

For both cases, I believe we need to replace "127.0.0.1" with
defaultHostName where
       String defaultHostName = confs.getString("bindaddress");
