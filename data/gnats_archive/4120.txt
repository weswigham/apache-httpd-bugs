>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1 with no Sun c compiler but gcc 2.7.2.f.1 installed.
uname: SunOS corona 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-4
>Description:
./configure dumps:
./Configure: make: not found
 + adding selected modules
./helpers/TestCompile: make: not found
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
[zap]
>How-To-Repeat:
Try configuring on a machine that has gcc installed but not as to replace the _not_ installed
sun C compiler. Hey, I inherited this mess and all I'm supposed to do is upgrade apache
(we have 1.1.3 now !!)
Note that configure echoes "+ setting C compiler to gcc" YET it still assumes that there is a "make" (instead of using "gmake" at least as a backup).
>Fix:
If "make" not found AND "+ setting C compiler to gcc" look for "gmake". On this
system, that change (actually a symbolic link gmake->make) fixes everything.

State-Changed-Why:
Uh, I don't think it's much to ask for "make" to exist.
Create a symlink from gmake to make... surely apache isn't
the only thing with this problem.
