</FORM>


By right if I check all the values or some of the values and submit,  i will get all the values. But in Apache Web Server, even if i check two values and submit, i can only get the first value. I have try the same code on other web server and it runs fine. but it is somewhat strange in Apache. 

Can u please reactify this problem. Thank You.

This has nothing to do with the Apache web server; it has to do with whatever servlet engine you are using to process the form, and with however your servlet is written.

 OK, i am using the apache Jserv to process my servlet. but i still don't 
 understand why it works on other web server? it is just a simple form that 
 post to the web server to process.
