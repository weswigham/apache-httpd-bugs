>Description:
I wrote a CGI script in C named "mycgi". It can run by "/cgi/mycgi?a" but can't run by "/cgi/mycgi?a=b". A message "Premature end of script header" in error_log. I wrote a debug message at the beginning of main of "mycgi.c". In the case of no '=' I can see the message and the other I can't. That means "mycgi" doesn't run in that case!
>How-To-Repeat:
Run any cgi script from browser with "?a=b".
