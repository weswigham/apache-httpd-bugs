>Description:
Trying to use the file level permissions in .htaccess and it only accepts the last entry.  For example my .htaccess:

AuthType Basic
AuthName Stats
AuthUserFile /etc/.htpasswd
AuthGroupFile /etc/.htgroup

<Files ~ "file1.9*|mrtg*">
require user user1
</Files>

<Files file2.html>
require group group1
</Files>

In this scenario it ends up only looking at the 'require group group1' and
it gives me access to the entire directory.

State-Changed-Why:
That's because your regex is incorrect.

Something like "[(mrtg*)(file1\.9*)]" is probably closer
to what you want, but you need to find a regex tutorial
and go through it to see how to construct regexes.
