>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
BSDI 4.1 patch level 4.1.1 
Apache 1.3.9
gcc compiler
Shared_core
Raven 1.4.2
>Description:
My configure:

./configure \
--with-layout=Apache \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-module=so \
--enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max \
--enable-suexec \
--suexec-caller=www \
--suexec-userdir=www \
--suexec-uidmin=100 \
--suexec-gidmin=100 \
--suexec-safepath=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin \
--suexec-docroot=/usr/local/apache/share/htdocs 

I have all the modules being loaded except for unique Id which will not load.  
I first noticed the problem when I was tring to make socket calls from within apache & php.  With no luck.  After poking around, I noticed that it worked with IP's.  After poking around trying to trouble shoot things myself, I notice that the log files are not doing reverse name lookup.  I tried turning HostnameLookups on and off (not double) to no avail.
>How-To-Repeat:
I was able to reproduce this problems straight out of the tar on the BSDi 4.1 machine, as well as with raven ssl installed, php, frontpage and mod_auth_radius.  It is running successfully on another BSDI 4.1 machine but is not compiled with shared_core on that machine.  When we compile it with shared_core on that machine it will not do hostname lookups.

I wish I did.  :(
