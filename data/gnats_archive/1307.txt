I have noticed that there was another report of this problem, but there has
been no reference to it since June.
Eventually the cache size gets so big it fills the HD.
Here is the section from my config.

CacheRoot /cache
CacheSize 5000       #Is this approx 5Meg?
CacheGcInterval 4
CacheMaxExpire 24
CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
CacheDefaultExpire 12

We also have a ProxyRemote directive

Do you really have the '#' on the CacheSize
line?  If so, try removing it.

 No. The # is not in the actual config file, it was just added in the 
 email for clarification of the CacheSize setting.
