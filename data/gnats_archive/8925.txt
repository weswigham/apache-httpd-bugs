>Description:
on windows95
Can't start web server: error message as mentioned in synopsis:
Error libapr.dll linked to kernel32.dll importation FilesAttributeExa

During installation, I've seen a dos console shortly saying "fichier introuvable" which means "files not found", but the install process ended by saying it was successful.

My windows is clean, I've just done a complete reformat to make sure my upgrades for Apache Tomcat and Cocoon are made from scratch. I've only 
installed:

win95
apache_2_0_28-beta-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi
winsock2
IE5.5
InstMsi.exe (1400 ko)


Hope it helps. 
Hope to be able to use Apache2 soon on win95.
