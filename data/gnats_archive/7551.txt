 Motown Sings the Blues
 Allegations of Civil Rights Violations Abound
  
 By Catherine Kelly
 
 Police brutality is not just for white cops, it is also a problem that 
 plaugues mostly black cities. In recent weeks, the Detroit police 
 department has received not just national but international scrutiny 
 for possible human and civil rights violations.
 
 In March, The Detroit Free Press first reported on the police 
 department's alleged policy which allows homicide investigators to not 
 just arrest suspects but also round-up witnesses including spouses, 
 brothers, sisters, family friends and hold them for interview without 
 an arrest warrant, often for up to 72 hours. This policy-which has 
 interchangeably been confirmed and denied by Police Chief Benny 
 Napoleon-may contribute to Detroit's arrest statistics, some of the 
 highest in the country. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report 
 for 1998 one in every 13 murder arrests in the country was made by the 
 Detroit police.

 Inner City Schools Wade Through Charter Debate:
 Savoy Charts the Confusing Waters
 
 Part One 
 
 By Vinita Srivastava
 
 The urban school system can ensnare like a trap if you are a parent, 
 politician or educator. Ultimately, though, it is the student that is 
 harmed. If this month's debate and parent vote regarding the 
 privatization of five under-performing schools in New York City--three 
 in Brooklyn, one in the Bronx and one in Harlem--are any indication, 
 the push-pull politics can stymie, confound and deter possible escape 
 routes.

 Anna Deavere Smith 
 By Fatin Sabur 
 
 In March of 1991, Rodney King was beaten by four, white, Los Angeles 
 cops who stopped him for speeding. When a mostly white jury found the 
 officers innocent, the city reeled, exploding into three days of 
 rioting, looting and violence.

 Say Goodbye To The SAT
 By Jason Johnson
 
 
 Imagine taking a test that is eight hours long but determines the next 
 20 years of your life. You're not being tested on anything you've ever 
 learned in school, but instead your aptitude--things you should know 
 in the opinion of a group of scientists in New England. 
 
 This is the scenario faced by millions of American high school 
 students every year who take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The 
 test has come under intense scrutiny for years for it's perceived bias 
 against black students, and finally some institutions are beginning to 
 take a second look at the role this standardized exam has in college 
 acceptance.
