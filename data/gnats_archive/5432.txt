>Description:
I'm using Apache 1.3.9 and mod_rewrite with a servlet engine(ATG Dynamo 3.5). 
The servlet engine generates session ids as parameters to HTTP path segments
(as specified in rfc-2396), see the example for how the URLs look like. The session id parameter is 
stripped when we do a redirect(and we do ofcourse loose the associated user 
session). This is not a problem if we use mod_rewrite without redirecting and
query parameters are also part of the redirect.

Here is the relevant extract from httpd.conf :

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/pubs/somesite/(.*$) /$1 [R]
>How-To-Repeat:
http://prodtest.somesite.de/pubs/somesite/template/;$sessionid$3QJML0YAAAAADQFIAHWCFEQ
>Fix:
I think the mod_rewrite module should keep path segment parameters when it
does a redirect. I haven't looked into the source code to have any specific 
suggestion on fixes in the code.
