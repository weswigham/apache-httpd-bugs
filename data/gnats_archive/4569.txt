>Description:
We are planning to switch from NCSA httpd 1.5.2 to Apache 1.3.6. When building
NCSA there was a #define which you could uncomment which would allow it to
understand "Allow from LOCAL" in the access configuaration. This meant that
local machines which did not generate fully qualified domain names would get
access. This feature does not seem to be present in Apache. As all the machines
in our department report themselves as "machine" rather than "machine.cee.hw.ac.uk"
then this feature is important to us to restrict access to certain parts of our
web site. Is there any equivalent way of doing this with Apache, or could the
feature be added at some point?

State-Changed-Why:
How about restricting by IP address instead?

Allow from 137.195.52.0/24

This should also save the delay of a DNS lookup.

 As we have a total of 20 subnets in our dept. that means 20 "Allow from" lines 
 rather than just one.
