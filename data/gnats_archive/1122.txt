Sample session:

POST /cgi-bin/page HTTP/1.0
Content-Length: 25

Content-Type: text/html

Content-Type: text/html

<head><title>Page sent</title>
</head><body><H1>Page sent.</H1></body>

The actual binary simply outputs the Content-type, a blank line, and the HTML.
If I don't include the content type header, the type is sent as text/plain,
but there is no duplicate header.
>How-To-Repeat:
The actual printf in the C source is

printf("Content-Type: text/html\n\n");

later on the HTML is printed.

State-Changed-Why:
Please send the complete source for a _minimal_ program
that replicates the behavior.  It is likely a problem
with your CGI.  If you simply have it consist of nothing
but the one line printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n") does
it still give the same error?

What if you try a GET instead of a POST?

 Hi. I received your mail, but have NOT read it. Unfortunately, the
 rapidly increasing amount of unsolicited advertising via e-mail
 (junk e-mail or spam mail) has increased to such a point that I
 have been forced to start rejecting mail from unknown sources.
 
 If you are NOT sending me an unacceptable message (if you are in
 any doubt, carefully read the terms below), then please resend your
 message to "nsayer+xyzzy@quack.kfu.com". You will only have to
 ever do this once. You need not direct future e-mail to that
 special address as you will be added to my address book. For
 your convenience, you can also simply reply to this message.
 Your original message has been included at the end.
 
 To those of you inconvenienced by this procedure, I appologise. I hope,
 however, that you will lay the blame for this at the feet of those who
 are truly responsible: The people choking the net with spam.
 
 THE FOLLOWING TERMS APPLY ONLY TO UNINVITED SOLICITATIONS:
 
 I do not want to receive uninvited solicitations by email (Junk Email'').
 I am unwilling to receive Junk Email freely because it costs me time and
 money. If you send me any Junk Email other than on the terms of the offer
 set out in the following nine points, I will take this to mean that you
 plan to use what I offered you without paying for it. If you ever try to
 do this I reserve my right to take any action available to me without
 further reference to you. Actions available to me include taking proceedings
 against you for negligence or breach of contract, which may result in
 substantial damages being awarded against you by a court. The unauthorized
 use of my computing facilities may even be a crime. 
 
 	1. I offer to receive all further email from you on the terms set
 	   out below. If you send me any solicitation by email without my
 	   express prior written consent this will be taken as your acceptance
 	   of this offer. 
 	2. For the purposes of points 3 and 4, you will be taken to have
 	   sent any email sent by any entity apparently associated with
 	   you for the purpose of sending email solicitations. 
 	3. You must pay me fifty US dollars for each such item of email that
 	   you send me. 
 	4. You must pay me fifty US dollars for each copy of each email
 	   solicitation that you send to anybody or any email address
 	   referred to below, even if you don't send a copy to me. You
 	   may also have to pay other persons as well if they have sent
 	   you a similar offer. 
 	5. I may join with any of those persons for the purpose of efficiently
 	   collecting your payments. 
 	6. You must mail payment by certified check to me within five
 	   working days of the transmission of the email. If you do not
 	   know where to send payment, you must state this in the email
 	   and give me an easy way to tell you. 
 	7. Each email item must be uniquely identified, and each payment
 	   must clearly identify the relevant item or items. 
 	8. You must tell me your name and full business and residential
 	   addresses in each email message. 
 	9. I may vary the terms of or terminate this offer at any time
 	   (even after you have accepted it). Any new terms will apply to
 	   all email you send after you have been notified of a variation.

 Oh yea?  Every time the status on the PR changes whoever changes it will
 manually have to forward the change to you since it comes from a different
 address.  And I have to fix the subject line again for our bug tracking
 system, etc.  Quite annoying.

 Add a fflush(stdout) here.  stdout is buffered, so both child and parent
 end up writing it.
 
 As an alternative, you could use the appropriate setvbuf() call to disable
 buffering out stdout but that is less desirable because it adds more
 overhead.

 Ah. I didn't think of that. Sounds like a bug in FreeBSD's stdio code
 then. Perhaps fork() should flush first or something. IMHO it's a
 bug if one write results in double traffic just because of a fork.
 But it's nothing to do with Apache. Thanks for your time.
