>Description:
The subject is the error message indicated when I put a "User" directive within an IP virtual Host bracketed area.  I have complied suexec and it is installed in the ServerRoot.  

This functioning is contrary to what is described in the 2.0 documentation and in fact is an absolutely necessary feature that I used to set the username/groupname in suexec'd cgi scripting in my operations.

Comment-Added:
The ability to configure CGI scripts to run as different 
users/groups on a per virtual-host basis still exists.  You
are getting this error message, because the configuration
has changed slightly.  Instead of using User/Group 
directives in the config file, you should use 
SuexexUserGroup.  This directive has not been documented 
yet, so I am moving this PR to a doc bug until this is 
resolved.
