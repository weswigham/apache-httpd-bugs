>Description:
<!--#exec cmd="./test.cgi"-->

should NOT work. we have ExecCGI disabled. But we want users to be able
to still run #exec cgi and #exec cmd provided they are running things in our
cgi-bin area.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
have #exec cmd not allow things to be executed in directories that have
ExecCGI turned off.

State-Changed-Why:
"exec cmd" does not execute CGIs and does not have anything
to do with CGIs so it is not and should not be impacted
by ExecCGI.  "exec cgi" is because it executes CGIs.

If you only wish to allow people to execute things otherwise
allowed, have them use "include virtual" and use
Options IncludesNOEXEC.

"include virtual" will allow you to include any virtual path
that is normally accessible, even things that happen to be
CGIs when IncludesNOEXEC is enabled.  Note that there is
a bug (and a PR about it somewhere...) in include virtual
where it incorrectly denies the execution of scripts that
would be executed in a directory with ExecCGI set; those in
ScriptAliased directories still work.
