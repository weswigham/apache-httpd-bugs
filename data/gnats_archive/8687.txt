>Environment:
I'm using the core installation of Red Hat 7.1, but *without* the Apache RPM (I compiled it and installed it from the sources).
>Description:
I configured Apache with the following options:
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --server-uid=www --server-gid=www --enable-module=most --enable-shared=max

I went into the experimental module directory of the Apache sources and compiled mod_auth_digest with:
# /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -i -a -c mod_auth_digest.c

No errors were reported, the appropriate load module directives were added to httpd.conf and I'm not using mod_digest. When I try to start the server, it says
"configuration broken". When I do a configtest, the following appears:

# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl configtest
Syntax error on line 238 of /usr/local/apache-1.3.22/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_auth_digest.so into server:
/usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_auth_digest.so: undefined symbol: randbyte

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Nov 11 12:20:26 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
mod_auth_digest doesn't support being compiled with apxs.  You need to include it in your build process when you build Apache.
