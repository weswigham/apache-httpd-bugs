>Release:        1.3.12
>Organization:
>Environment:
OS: Windows 98, Release 2
Compiler: n/a (Downloaded the Win32 Binaries)
>Description:
I do not have Apache installed in it's standard directory, mine is in 'C:\Program Files\WebServer\Apache' (note the space as a possible problem?). Run Apache on a Win98, R2 system then try and either Shutdown or Restart the system while Apache is running. You should see a dialog box that reads '[APACHE] You must quit this program before you quit Windows. Click OK to quit the program and Windows, or click Cancel to continue running the program and Windows. [OK] [Cancel]'. Click 'Cancel' DOES NOT generate an error. Clicking 'OK' does. Apache crashes =(
>How-To-Repeat:
Please see description section.
>Fix:
I believe the problem MIGHT lie in a hardcoded path that is attached to the above mentioned shutdown dialog. Or it might possibially be an issue with the space in the path to my Apache directory?

State-Changed-Why:

This is a duplicate report.  Search the bugs.apache.org
database for details.

The Apache 1.3.13 release includes significant changes to
Win9x and WinNT server execution, however the bug in closing
the Win95 console window will remain forever, since MS has
orphaned that bug for the past several years.
