>Description:
This isn't a bug report so much as an observation.  When using virtual hosts,
the logs log access and errors relative to the virtual host root.  This throws
off any statistics one would want to generate from the logs.  It would be very
useful to have a URL or file path translation to indicate that a log entry was
a virtual host query and what the real file path was.  Virtual hosts might not
start at the root of a server but logging as if the access was from the root 
confuses things greatly.  I don't know if this would mess up any log file 
standards but it would help a lot.
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, use virtual hosting.
>Fix:
See above.  But having something in the logs indicating a)that a virtual host was 
access and b) what the real path was would solve the problem.

State-Changed-Why:
For the access log, you can use a different log format
to include the name of the virtual host involved; see
the src/support/split-logfile script.  As for the error
log.. can you give an example of an error message you
find confusing in this way?

      I'm concerned about access_log.  The error_log seems to work.
 I checked out src/support/split-logfile.  It takes access_log as STDIN.
 It then assumes (?!) that the first field of each line is a virtual
 host designation.  It then proceeds to split things up into files by
 that name.  The first field in my access_log is an IP number not a
 virtual host designation, at least not a ser er virtual host name.
 I'm unclear as to how this is going to help tell the different between
 log entries which reference the real host name root vs references
 which access a server virtual host name that points to a directory
 farther down the tree than the root.  They look the same in the log as
 far as I can tell.  Maybe I'm just slow today.

Comment-Added:
I guess I was being excessively cryptic.  I pointed you
to split-logfile as an example of how you could include
the virtual host name in your access log.  Or, if you
don't want to pollute your main access log, you can
always create another one with an alternate format by
using the CustomLog directive.  Prefixing the format
with something like "{%{Host}i|%v}" will result in
each record starting with the name of the virtual host
that was requested, and the name of the vhost that
actually serviced the request.  From that, the URI
field, and your knowledge of each vhost's DocumentRoot,
Alias, and ScriptAlias settings you should be able to
map the request to an actual file.

Or are you asking for a log field descriptor that includes
the name of the file actually served?  What would you
have it do if there *wasn't* a file involved (such
as the output from mod_status)?

State-Changed-Why:
One log per vhost is very common - but be sure to check
out question #20 in the Apache FAQ (online at
<http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html>.  If you're
not running a lot of vhosts, this is probably the best
solution for you.

I'm not sure what %f will do if there's no file associated
with the request (such as the mod_status example I cited
earlier).  It's a good idea to keep an eye on %v if you
start finding documents getting served by the wrong
vhosts.

It sounds as though you're on your way, so I'll close
this report.  Thanks for using Apache!
