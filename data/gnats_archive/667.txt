aix cc & gcc 2.7.2.2
AIX rs1 2 4 00100009C000
powerpc-ibm-aix4.2.1.0
>Description:
upon link, an undefined symbol
__set_errno128 is recorded.
adding -lm to the link line removes the problem
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
modify the config script for aix4.2
Note, not that it matters to apache, but AIX 4.2 returns interface informatino
in the BSD manner rather than in the other manner.
ie: not fixed size records in the returned data

State-Changed-Why:
You say "with this release of aix"... but adding -lm woulud be
safe across all aix right?  Or should we special case everything
from 4.2.1 on?

 I think adding -lm is safe across the board.
