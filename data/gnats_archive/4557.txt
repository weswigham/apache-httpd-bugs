>Description:
I had NCSA for 4 years and things were great.
I upgraded to Apache, which is supposed to be a transparent upgrade, and
NONE of my .htaccess directories work.

Here is the problem very simply put.
Apache doesn't seem to recognize the authgroup directive. Every user
gets a password mismatch in the error_log.

Here's what I have done.
I left the /opt/apache/conf/access.conf alone, except to tell it where
my htdocs directory is. I haven't changed anything else.

In /opt/apache/conf, I have a htpasswd.users and an htgroup.users files

htpasswd.users looks like this
userA:passwd (encrypted)
userB:passwd (encrypted)
etc....

htgroup.users looks like this
groupA: userA userB

in /ftp/pres I created a .htaccess and it looks like this

AuthUserFile /opt/apache/conf/htpasswd.users
AuthGroupFile /opt/apache/conf/htgroup.users
AuthName "Security Clearance"
AuthType Basic

<Limit GET>
require group groupA
</Limit>

whenever, anyone (userA,userB) try to go to
http://myserver.here.com/ftp/pres, they are presented with the familiar
login box. All attempts return a "user userA: password mismatch"

If I change the .htaccess file to:

AuthUserFile /opt/apache/conf/htpasswd.users
AuthGroupFile /opt/apache/conf/htgroup.users
AuthName "Security Clearance"
AuthType Basic
<Limit GET>
require user userA userB
</Limit>

Then EVERYTHING works fine.
