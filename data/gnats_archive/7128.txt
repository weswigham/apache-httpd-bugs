>Description:
Giving such URLs to apache forces it to change the current directory somehow
and the relative path to 'images' directory becomes wrong and that's why error
log becomes full of 404 errors...

>Fix:
use paths relative to URL given in <base> tag,
but this needs to change all HTML files and CGI scripts we have :(

I agree this is an irritating "feature", but it
is really a fundamental problem with the interaction
of filesystems (which are perfectly happy with any
number of slashes) and relative URLs (which treat each
slash as a separate path segment).

There are a numbert of ways to alleviate this "feature",
such as (untested):
RedirectMatch (.*)//*(.*) http://yourhost/$1/$2
but probably the best thing to do is to not
use URLs with multiple slashes.

Thanks for using Apache!
