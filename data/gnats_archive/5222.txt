I installed Apache 1.3.9 using OpenSA 0.10. (http://www.opensa.de/)
>Description:
The FILE* _popen returns in any CGI program does not contain the output of the program, but instead appears in the console of the machine on which the web server is running.  (It pops up a Command-Prompt-like window with the output of the program and disappears really quickly.)  
This happens *only* on 1.3.9.  It worked fine on 1.3.6.
>How-To-Repeat:
compile a program like the following on VC++ 5.0 or 6.0 and call it through CGI:

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *f = _popen("dir c:\\", "rt");
  char buf[1024];
  printf("Content-Type: text/plain\n\n");
  while (fgets(buf, 1024, f)) {
    fputs(buf, stdout);
  }
  _pclose(f);
  return 0;
}

will not print anything on 1.3.9 in the browser.  
Please try it on 1.3.6 and you will see it correctly prints out the content of the directory C:\ in the browser.

no, sorry.
