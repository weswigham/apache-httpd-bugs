>Unformatted:

I have played around with this release and try to make it build on
HP-UX. I had the same problem with what you submitted initially.
However, what I found out is there is something wroug with the script
that can't generate the right set of CFLAGS. To be brief, here is what
you can do:

Modify the Makefile after you run the Configure and set CFLAGS as:

CFLAGS1= -Aa -w -DHPUX -D_HPUX_SOURCE

or

CFLAGS1= -Aa -v -w -DHPUX10 -D_HPUX_SOURCE

If you use HP/UX 10. It should make it build.
