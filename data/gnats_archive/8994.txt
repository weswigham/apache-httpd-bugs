apache 1.3.22
>Description:
ScriptInterpreterSource registry option is apparently
non-functional.  This worked fine under windows-nt.  
The "shebang" info is apparently being used instead,
>How-To-Repeat:
In win2k the "printenv.pl" script supplied with the apache distribution
doesn't work.
>Fix:
so perhaps (just a guess) the root of the problem is that win2k
rearranged the relevant registry information.
