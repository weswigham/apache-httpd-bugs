>Description:
If a CGI script returns it's own Status header and Last-Modified header,
server might think it's sending 304 Not modified response, yet still
send the Status in same form as the CGI program passed. This is detrimental
if the CGI script doesn't care about If-Modified-Since header sent by client
and always returns 200 OK. If the client asks for the same
resource second time, it passes If-Modified-Since header with the date
same as the one in Last-Modified header it got the first time. The CGI
script returns 200 OK and again Last-Modified header, possibly same
as before. Now, in ap_scan_script_header_err_core(), server finds out
the resource didn't actually changed and the routine returns 304 Not
Modified - thus the core of Apache won't return any body to client. But
since r->status_line is not reset before ap_scan_script_header_err_core()
is left, status is sent in same form as CGI sent it. To the client, it
seems as if server returned 200 OK and sent no body.

I couldn't find any public server with "clean" Apache 1.3 installed, sorry.
Note that if server is presented with If-Modified-Since header
with date sooner than date in Last-Modified header sent by script,
server returns 200 OK with no body.
>Fix:
Use MS IIS ... Okay, just joking ;-) Following patch should DTRT:
