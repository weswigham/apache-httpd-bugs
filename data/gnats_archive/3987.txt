>Organization:
>Environment:
Apache 1.3.4 , JServ 1.0b3, Windows NT, VC 5.0 compiler
>Description:
Assume a class in a jar/zip file (foo1.jar) with the following 
directory structure:
foo/Test.class

assume a servlet zone: test

assume the following entries in the jserv.properties:
zones=test
test.properties=C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache JServ\conf\test.properties

assume that the repository of the servlet zone contains the 
jar/zip file - namely foo1.jar. viz. the following entries in 
the test.properties:
repositories=C:\...\foo1.jar

assume the entry in the httpd.conf: 
ApJServMount /servlets/test /test

assume the servername: http://www.cheeroot.com

When I place this jar/zip file in the repository of a servlet zone and try to 
access it with a URL: 
http://www.cheeroot.com/servlets/test/foo/Test
This gives the ClassNotFoundException: class foo not found

I tried all combinations of the URL: foo.Test, etc. but got the same exception.

The problem does not exist if the class does not reside within a directory in 
the jar/zip file. I did not test it with a jar file with more directory depths 
(ex: foo/foo1/Test.class), but i think that it could give more information 
about the problem. (please look at the suggestion for more input)
>How-To-Repeat:
Refer to the full description.
>Fix:
I could not debug it fully since I couldn't spend enough time on it... but 
this is what i found from debugging the C and the Java module... hope it is 
helpful.

The java part of the code gets the wrong information. It gets servlet 
name as "foo" and path info as "Test" and the correct servlet zone "test". 
This can be verified via the request headers in the jserv log file. or in 
(JServConnection.java -- readData at switch(id) 
when id == C for servlet zone/name and 
when id == E for path info)

I believe that the error lies in jserv_translate_match:
When a match is found for a servlet zone, in this case: 
mountpoint = "/servlets/test/" 
URI = "/servlets/test/foo/Test"

it enters the "else if ((uri[x-1]=='/') & (mnt[y]=='\0')) { " block 
and since mount->zone == "/servlets/test" finally comes to the following 
point:

        x = 0;
        while (tmp[x] != '/' && tmp[x] != 0)
            x++;
        if (tmp[x] == '/') {
            r->path_info = ap_pstrdup(r->pool,tmp+x);
            tmp[x] = 0;
        }
        req->zone=mount->zone;
        req->servlet=ap_pstrdup(r->pool,tmp);
        return req;

I could not understand what was done here, but this generated the incorrect 
servlet name and the path info for the servlet. 
The error as I perceive it:
The servlet name :
should be:
the string from end of uri to the last / in uri (or the start of uri whichever 
occurs first)
as opposed to:
the string from beginning of uri to the next / in uri (or the end of uri 
whichever occurs first). This is one of the reasons why the class which does 
not have a directory depth does not produce an error.

the path info:
should be:
the string from the start of uri to the last / in uri (if one exists else "")
as opposed to:
the string from the first / in uri to the end of uri

I did not debug this in complete detail but this loop definitely seemed out of 
place. I would really appreciate it if you could check this out and drop me a 
line in case you find something out or point any mistakes that I might have 
made.

Thanks in advance,
Cheeroot
