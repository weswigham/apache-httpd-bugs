>Description:
The master process seems to expose a resource leak under heavy load. The number of used files/sockets is continually increasing (under heavy load only, 5-15 requests to index.html per second!).

walhalla# sockstat | grep httpd | grep root | wc -l
	55

walhalla# fstat | grep httpd | wc -l
        2471

After 45mins under load (just getting ***a static*** index.html):
walhalla# sockstat | grep httpd | grep root | wc -l
	159

walhalla# fstat | grep httpd | wc -l
        6774

This will continue until all available files are used up. Killing the master process with "apachectl stop" or "kill" frees the files immediately. This happens with http and https.

>How-To-Repeat:
Just generate heavy traffic on a static page (index.html for example) and watch the number of used files increase.

 There are a ton of changes to 2.0.32 that is right now available at
 http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/
 
 Please see if that clears up your leakage.
