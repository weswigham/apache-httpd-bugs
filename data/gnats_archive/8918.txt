Windows XP Professional build 2600
>Description:
I add this to the httpd.conf file under the <directory> for htdocs

<Files proxy.cgi>
            AuthName "CGI Proxy Authorization"
            AuthType Basic
            AuthUserFile c:/Apache2/ht.passwd
            Require valid-user
</Files>

On Apache 1.3, it would ask for authentication when trying to access this file.  But, on 2.0.28, it just gives me a 401 Authentication Required error.  But, it never asks for a user/pass
>How-To-Repeat:
Add something similar to 
<Files proxy.cgi>
            AuthName "CGI Proxy Authorization"
            AuthType Basic
            AuthUserFile c:/Apache2/ht.passwd
            Require valid-user
</Files>
to the httpd.conf file and put a file with the name you are trying to block in the file you do it under and it should give a 401 error message.
