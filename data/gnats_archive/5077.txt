WinNT workstation 4.0

>Description:

Here is the case:

My serverRoot is d:/web

I create an alias on an external directory :
<Directory "d:/projects">
    Options ExecCGI Indexes
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

Alias	/projects	"d:/projects"

When requesting a CGI script in this aliased directory :
http://localhost/projects/myscript.php3

Thus there is no Apache error (200 in access.log) , i get a PHP error 
Fatal error: Unable to open d:/web/projects/myscript.php3 in - on line 0
No input file specified. 

See php error above : the file path given to PHP engine is not translated :
d:/web/projects/myscript.php3 
should be 
d:/projects/myscript.php3

 This is not a bug, it's a *feature* of PHP: whenever you put a .php file in
 a directory marked ExecCGI, PHP is run as a CGI and for security reasons it
 will not accept command-line parameters. This is causing the problem (the
 same thing happens on Linux/UNIX, BTW).
 
 To solve this problem, turn *OFF* the ExecCGI part of the directory
 containing your .php scripts.
 
 Here's what I use:
 
 ScriptAlias /php/ "C:/php/"
 
 ScriptInterpreterSource registry
 
 <Directory "C:/php">
     AllowOverride None
     Options None
 </Directory>
 
 You would have to add
 
 Alias /project "d:/projects"
 
 and you're all set.
