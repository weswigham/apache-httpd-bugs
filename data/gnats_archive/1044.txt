SunOS 4.1.4   /bin/cc or /usr/5bin/cc   sun4m & sun4c
>Description:
Compiling with a non-ANSI compiler breaks badly.

"conf.h" asks for "stdargs.h" which is not present in SunOS.

The regex & other .c & .h files have ANSI prototypes.

/dist/binaries/sunos_4.1.x/ contents are unreadable.

>How-To-Repeat:
Configure with native SunOS 4.1.x compiler specified
(gcc is not an option for various reasons).
>Fix:
Fix portability problems

 Sorry but we require ANSI C.  The code is completely prototyped.

State-Changed-Why:
As stated, ANSI C is a requirement, not an option.
If you don't have an ANSI C compiler, you can't
build the server.

As for the unreadable portion.. can you be more specific?
Do you mean you get permission problems when you try
to get the files, or can't unpack them, or what?

State-Changed-Why:
The file permissions were fixed.

Bruce would like us to more prominantly document that Apache
requires an ANSI-C compiler.  This is a reasonable request.

Thanks for using Apache!
