SCO_SV gate 3.2 2 i386
>Description:
I am running 2 httpd daemons with different configuration files each one.
httpd1 -f conf1/httpd.conf and httpd2 -f conf2/httpd.conf
I have the instruction ErrorDocument 403 /sorry.htm in conf1/srm.conf file
but not in the conf2/srm.conf configuration file.
When somebody try to access a document in a domain using conf1/httpd.conf, the
document sorry.htm works, But, if somebody try to access a document in a
domain using conf2/httpd.conf I will expect to receive the standar error
NOT FOUND, but, the sorry.htm document is tried to be executed.
each domain has different directories.

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly due to a configuration error; you
probably haven't overridden the ResourceConfig directive in
your conf2/httpd.conf file.
