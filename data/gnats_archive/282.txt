 I don't understand what you are asking or what the problem is. 
 Environment variables are not part of the HTTP spec and are used locally
 by CGIs.  If you are talking about the remote server, then to the remote
 server it appears like the request is coming from the proxy.

 Just for further clarification if the apache web server and proxy server
 are running on the same machine are the access logs contained in the
 proxy, identifiable by the web server?  Things like Username/I.P.
 address/hostname etc...attached to a URL  request from the client to the
 webserver. For example:I would want to check, without making a person
 reenter his login name that only rthomps is updating rthomps'
 information in an internal phonebook.  As I understand with the new
 Netscape proxy server I only have the I.P. address of the requesting
 client, which I should be able to correlate against the proxy accesslog
 to get his username and match that to an additonal database to confirm
 his identity. Can Apache Server (WEB, and PROXY) provide this
 functionality?

Yes, Apache does provide this functionality (IP address
logging). I had to use this to find a prankster at my old
job. In addition, you can log user ID if your site uses
IDENT protocol on its servers & clients.
