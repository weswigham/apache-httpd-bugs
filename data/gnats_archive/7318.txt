Hi!
I'm sure this is a simple compile option I'm overlooking, but I'm stuck...
how do I run more than 127 servers on one machine?
I need 180 or so, memory isn't a problem.
When I try to start the 128th server, I get
[emerg] No space left on device
in the error log.
Pls reply to me directly, I feel dumb enuf having to ask.
Thanks
