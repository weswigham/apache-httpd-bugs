>Description:
Configuration for php3:

---------------------------------------------------
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/httpd/cgi-bin/

AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .php3~ .php
Action  application/x-httpd-php3 /cgi-bin/php3
-----------------------------------------------------

We are shure that /home/httpd/cgi-bin/ exists and /cgi-bin/php3 is working well 
with existing URL's. If the .php3 - script doesn't exists, no Error 404 will be 
generated, but /cgi-bin/php3 will be called with a nonexitent PATH_TRANSLATED.
Result is, that no Error-Handler will be executed.

Output from /cgi-bin/php3: 

Fatal error: Unable to open /usr/local/apache/htdocs/lall.php3 in - on line 0
No input file specified.


I think, that this Problem is not only affecting php3-scripts only, but all 
cgi's wich are called with an action-Handler.
>How-To-Repeat:
Call a nonexitent .php3 File with php3-Configuration like above.
>Fix:
Detect missing .php3 script.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache is behaving correctly; it is up to the CGI (in your
case PHP) to do the right thing if it doesn't find a file
it is expecting. Perhaps you have configured PHP wrongly?
