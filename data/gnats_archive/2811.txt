I believe the bug exists on many OS and Versions
>Description:
Apache web server allows access to CGI execution
even if under AuthConfig-AuthUserFile-Limit-require
thing for malicious clients.
>How-To-Repeat:
Oh easy, just try my configuration out on our developmental server:

Use any normal browser and try this
http://dev.direct-connect.com/cgi-bin/private/access.cgi

Notice how it yanks up a Authentication box for
username and password login.  (I've installed an
access of user=rob and pass=rob for your testing.)
That's a good thing.  But now try this from a shell:

% telnet dev.direct-connect.com 80
Connected to dev.direct-connect.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
TEST /cgi-bin/private/access.cgi HTTP/1.0

Do NOT enter any "Authorization: Basic"
uuencoded garbage.  And bamn! it lets
you right in if you type any request
method besides "GET" or "POST"

This is how to make the configuration:

Just have this entry in your access.conf file:

-------------------------
<Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin>
AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig
Options None
</Directory>
-------------------------

Put these files into /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/private/
.htpasswd:
-------------------------
rob:2H9Qrho1uADlM
-------------------------

.htaccess:
-------------------------
AuthName RESTRICTED
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/private/.htpasswd
<Limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</Limit>
-------------------------

access.cgi:
-------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "<h1>Congratulations!</h1>\n";
print "CGI is running just fine.<pre>\n";
foreach (keys %ENV)
{print "ENV[$_]=\"$ENV{$_}\"\n";}
-------------------------
and chmod 755 access.cgi of course.

NOTE:
I found this out accidently from a bug in Netscape 4.5b1
when I had many windows open and something caused it to
submit a "HOST" method instead of a "POST" method and it
gave me total access to a protected site without me using
any username or password.  I did some debugging on your
apache server and found out this is what was happening.
I have since closed all these Netscape windows and
tried it again and could not duplicate that bug.  But
I can ALWAYS duplicate this bug on the Apache Server.
Obviously this security hole is the fault of the
Apache server, not a client bug.  This made me mad
because the protected site was on my Apache server
and I don't want people snooping around on my
server unless they are authorized.
>Fix:
Yes, simply report
"501 Method not implemented"
for clients attempting to access a CGI with a method
that is not exactly either "GET" or "POST"
DON'T JUST GO EXECUTING THE CGI.

State-Changed-When: Fri Aug  7 16:48:20 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is your configuration error.  You are telling Apache
only to limit GET and POST, then you complain when it does!
Just leave the Limit directive out if you want to limit
all methods.  This is described clearly in the docs.

 Works great if I delete the "Limit" lines.
 But this is just how I was told to install
 password protection for apache servers.
 
 oops.   :-)
 
 THANKS!!!!
