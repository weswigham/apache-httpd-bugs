State-Changed-Why:
Please have a little bit of consideration.

Your rudeness and cluelessness is not appreciated.  Before
you submit a bug report, you are clearly told both to search
the bug database and try a current version of Apache; doing
either one would have answered your question.

And, as the message says, that is a known problem in 1.3.1.
Use a current version.
