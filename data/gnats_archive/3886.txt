>Environment:
Redhat 5.1 with gcc version 2.7.2.3
Redhat 5.2 with gcc version egcs-2.91.57 19980901 (egcs-1.1 release)
>Description:
JServSSI only works for the first call of the function stat() in
the function get_path_info() in the file http_request.c in the 
src/main directory of the apache distribution.  The first time,
stat() claims the path /servlets is a link, but after that it
has a non-zero finfo.st_mode and fails for S_ISDIR, S_ISREG, 
and S_ISLNK, so check_safe_file() returns HTTP_FORBIDDEN.

I was able to narrow down the problem to stat(), but I wasn't able
to understand it's behavior.
>How-To-Repeat:
Start with Apache 1.3.4, JServ 1.0b2, and JServSSI 1.0.

Add module rewrite and load the rewrite module before jserv.
>Fix:
I added this hack to line 242 of http_request.c, so we could use JServSSI:

        else if (! strcmp("/servlets", path) )
        {
          errno = 0;
          rv = stat(path, &r->finfo);
          r->finfo.st_mode = 0;
        }
