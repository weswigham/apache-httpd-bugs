If a CGI try to sent a 204 HTTP response like using this script:
---
#!/bin/sh
echo "HTTP/1.0 204 No change"
echo ""
# end of script
--

The response is:
--
Internal Server Error
[...]
--

Error log says:
---
httpd: [Thu Nov  4 00:35:54 1999] [error] [client 10.42.1.54] malformed header from script. Bad header=HTTP/1.0 204 No change: /nfs/aux/space/users/proj/fg/www/CGI/test.cgi
---

This CGI result:
---
HTTP/1.o 204 No change

---
