Output from uname -a:
Linux plateholder.com 2.2.14-5.0 #1 Tue Mar 7 20:53:41 EST 2000 i586 unknown

Operating system is Red Hat Linux 6.2 with Apache SSL server	
>Description:
When trying to start httpsd(/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpsd start) it asks for the PEM pass phrase and when entered says [OK]
When trying to stop httpsd (/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpsd stop) it says [FAILED]
After starting and getting the status the script says "httpsd dead but subsys locked"
After starting the server and trying to view the website it wont come up as we are
unalbe to connect to the server on port 80 from any other computers.	
>How-To-Repeat:
Stop and start the httpsd server using a config file that listens on multiple ports?
>Fix:
No

State-Changed-When: Sun Nov 19 16:36:30 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Sorry, but since we do not distribute an init script, and
we do not distribute an SSL enabled server, we cannot
help you with this.  Please contact the person who
supplied you with the server.
Thanks for using Apache!
