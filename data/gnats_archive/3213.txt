Example code:

# Redirect 'Resource Not Found' to main WWW server...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-U [skip=1]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -U
RewriteRule ^(.+) http://www.fccj.org$1 [L,R=permanent]  

The option [skip|S=#] not working...

Try example code...
>Fix:
Nope, sorry.  I do wish there were more mod_rewrite examples and resources;
yes, I've seen rse's mod_rewrite guide.

State-Changed-Why:
Who said that [skip] is supported for RewriteConds?
You should get an "RewriteCond: unknown flag" error.
The documentation correctly describes [skip] only
for RewriteRule. Not for RewriteCond.

 I know  :]  And I do, but I mis-read the docs on this and after
 sometime of trying different things - reported a bug, as I saw it.
 
 Well, after more thoughts flowing thru brain :]  I think there
 could be better grouping of RewriteCond statements
 IE. RewriteCond (if true, skip next or [all], etc...)
 
 I guess I am just thinking too literally, or not literally
 enough.  At any rate, I would like to suggest a new 'feature'
 using [SKIP=n] in addition to [OR].   For example:
 
 RewriteCond (If this is True) [SKIP=2]  (ie.  Skip next tests.)
 RewriteCond (Otherwise, is there a way to group
 RewriteCond  these two tests together ??? )
 RewriteRule (rewrite URL like this...)
 
 
 What I was trying (in pseudo code) is -
 
 RewriteCond (If given resource is 'internal Apache item') then TRUE(?)
 Otherwise test following RewriteConds and then execute
 RewriteRule (if all conditions are true? If one is true?)
 
 I need to stop and re-read the part where is must say 
 "That if all RewriteCond are true then the RewriteRule
 gets done???"  I must keep missing that somewhere...
 
 I appreciate the power of the mod_rewrite module, but
 right now I am in "foot shooting stage..."
 
 
 Thx!
 -Sneex-  :]
