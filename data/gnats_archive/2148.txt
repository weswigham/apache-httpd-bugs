>Description:
Apache documentation does not specify if a , or space should be used for multiple group names and some modules implement it as spaces and others impliment it as commas. eg:
<Limit GET POST PUT>
require group snet-lp snet-dp snet-fp
</Limit>

mod_auth_dbm.c would only see the snet-lp group and would deny access to anyone in the snet-dp or snet-fp groups, while mod_auth_msql.c would work fine for any of the the 3 groups.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
1) decide if the seperator should be a , or a space
2) Document it properly in core
3) check and change mod_auth*.c (usualy there is a getword a few lines above the "user %s not in right group" error message and you just need to change the third parameter of the getword)

State-Changed-Why:
I checked the source and you are right, there is
a non-consistency. But not in parsing the arguments
of the "require" command (where all modules use
spaces as the seperator). The inconsistency is
in parsing the group files as I see the point!
mod_auth.c parses it with spaces while mod_auth_db
and mod_auth_dbm parses it with commas (which is
more like Unix /etc/group).

So IMHO mod_auth should use commas for the plain file.
