Currently access and denial are done via hostname or IP address/range.
There's also the match of an environment variable, but that seems very
limiting. I'd like to see a <IfDenied></IfDenied> directive that would
allow me to then use the features of mod_auth (such as require
valid-user). For instance:

<Directory />
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from .research.att.com
<IfDenied>
AuthType Basic
AuthName Private
AuthUserFile /www/www/.htusers
require valid-user
</IfDenied>
</Directory>

State-Changed-Why:
The example you give is already possible just using the
Satisfy directive.

The whole authentication and access control language
needs a rewrite, and that may happen in 2.0.  We don't really
want to add a zillion hacks to it though in 1.3 and make
it more of a mess...

State-Changed-Why:
This almost certainly won't happen in 1.3, so I'm marking
this as suspended for future consideration.
