>Description:
Our web server is setup with Linux running Apache 1.2.6. However everytime
a CGI executed its leave as a zombie process (however it is killed automatically)
a short while later. Also when the load on the web server starts to get high
(between 11:00 AM and 6:00PM Mon - Fri) the server hangs and I can see a large
amount of defunct process by using ps -auxww. I know that the server
has not yet reach its load capacity (its an Pen II 300). And every once in a while
a CGI will use 99.1 % of the CPU. I have check the CGIs and its not the CGI's
problem because I have use the same CGI's under other setups (i.e. BSD with Apache
and Solaris with Netscape) and they were all fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
The problem happens when the load on the server increases at our web site.
This seems to happen around 11:00 AM to 6:00PM Mon - Fri
>Fix:
I hope (think) it is apache, maybe install a newer a version. Maybe its Linux?

 What do you mean by this?  Are you sure it is for _every_ CGI?  What kills
 it automatically, and how much is "a short while" later?

 What do you mean by "high load"?  How many simultaneous connections?  How
 many requests per second?

 Erm... your reasoning about how it can't be the CGI's problem doesn't
 hold.  If the CGI is taking up most of the CPU, then that is probably a
 problem in the CGI.  Just because you don't see it on other platforms
 because the circumstances aren't right or there is some other difference
 doesn't mean it can't be there.
 
 Are you running any virtual hosts?
 
 Please try upgrading to the current version of Apache.

 Basically whenever a CGI executes (over the web) the CGI doesn't end
 automaticlly
 it turns into an zombie process then ends. This also happens with perl
 scripts as
 well.  This phenomemon is very similar to the one at
 
 http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/541

 I can't begin to tell you. All I know is that the problem happens during
 the day
 which is when we get more hits. The problem disappeared at night and on
 weekends
 which is when our hits does down. If you can tell me how I can find this
 out please
 let me know.

 I should rephrase this. the web server dies every few minutes minutes. I
 have to restart the
 httpd daemon. Sometime using ps -auxww i see process /usr/sbin/httpd 
 using 99.1% of the CPU. Some time its a CGI sometimes it just dies. Many
 times there is a huge list of defunct process.

 Erm... where are the zombies?  There are no zombies in that ps output.
 
 All I see of interest is a whole bunch of perl scripts blocked on
 something.  Are you using NFS on the system?
