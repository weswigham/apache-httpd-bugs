>Organization:
>Environment:
The released win32 Binarys, as well as MSVC++ compiled Apache 1.3.9 on Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, SP4.
>Description:
Apache is installed at e:/winapp/apache/, document root is d:/www.bjoernsworld.de/

i put a .htaccess to D:/.htaccess and it is parsed by apache. D:/ should never be touched by apache, only d:/www.bjoernsworld.de/ is relevant.
>How-To-Repeat:
Copy a .htaccess file one level higher than the document root
>Fix:
Only search .htaccess in the document root and 'downstairs'.
