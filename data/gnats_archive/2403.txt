I still struggle with the CGI problems of apache 1.3b7. 
(Have you ever tried to write a CGI-Script without access to the CGI 
enviroment variables?). 

This bug should be fixed in apache 1.30, but I can't find a new 
binary release for Win32.

I'm still using Visual C++ 4.2, so I can't compile it myself.

Thanks
Andreas

State-Changed-When: Wed Jun 10 05:06:21 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Please identify the versions correctly.  There are no "1.30"
or "13b7" versions of the server; there *are* "1.3.0" and
"1.3b7" versions.

This issue with CGI envariables on Win32 is a known problem,
as it seems you've found (see PR#2294 in the bug database).
The 1.3.0 Win32 kit is being worked on right now; as the
1.3.0 announcement stated, though, the Win32 version is
not yet considered production quality.  Please keep
watching the Apache Web site distribution area - the Win32
1.3.0 package will be put there as soon as it's ready.
