Solaris 2.7
>Description:
I downloaded apache1.3 binaries and installed on Solaris 2.7.
By default "so" (Shared objects) is not enabled in the httpd server.
I would like to know how I can enable "so" in the core httpd server
without having apache server source ?

State-Changed-Why:
If the binary you have doesn't include support for dynamically
loadable modules, then you can't do it.  Simple.  You really
should compile your own.  You have to source for Apache, you
can get a free compiler for Solaris (gcc).
