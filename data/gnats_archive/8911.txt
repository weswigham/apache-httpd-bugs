>Description:
I loaded the latest versions of Apache, PHP and MySql on my Windows 98 se computer. I went to use my printer and I receive a message that it cannot load the device driver.  I went to my control panel/system and found the 2 USB Root Hubs with a black exclamation mark inside a yellow circle.  When I click the properties of one of the highlighted USB Root Hub, it showed that there was a problem with the NT*.vxd file for this hub. I put in the Windows 98 disk and clicked the fix button. Everything seemed to run smoothly at the end it said to restart the computer for the changes to take place. To make a long story short the problem still exists. 

I tried removing the affected root hubs but when I rebooted they were reinstalled. I also tried deleting and reinstalling the USB device manager. The above programs were the latest that I have installed on this machine.

How can I rectify this problem?

Thank you for your anticipated help on this matter.
