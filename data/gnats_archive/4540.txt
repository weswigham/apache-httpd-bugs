>Description:
I've tried to configure apache to start in /cgi-bin only files with *.cgi and deny execution of others...
After that I'found that CGI scripts, are executed without any options and handlers.... This is bug and security hole, I thing.

These is my configuration file:
### Section 1: Global Environment
ServerType standalone
ServerRoot "/usr/local/apache"
LockFile /var/log/apache/httpd.lock
PidFile /var/run/httpd.pid
ScoreBoardFile /var/log/apache/httpd.scoreboard
Timeout 300
KeepAlive On
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
KeepAliveTimeout 15
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 10
StartServers 5
MaxClients 150
MaxRequestsPerChild 30
ExtendedStatus On

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration

Port 80
User apache
Group apache
ServerAdmin webmaster@pia.ru
ServerName new.pia.ru
DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/share/htdocs"

<Directory />
    Options None
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>

<Directory "/usr/local/apache/share/htdocs">
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html
AccessFileName .htaccess
#To prevent it from others
<Files .htaccess>
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

UseCanonicalName on

DefaultType text/plain

HostnameLookups Off

ErrorLog /var/log/apache/error_log
LogLevel warn
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
CustomLog /var/log/apache/access_log combined
ServerSignature Email

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin/"
<Directory "/usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin">
     AllowOverride None
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
</Directory>

BrowserMatch "Mozilla/2" nokeepalive
BrowserMatch "MSIE 4\.0b2;" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "RealPlayer 4\.0" force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "Java/1\.0" force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "JDK/1\.0" force-response-1.0
==========================================================================
What else....
Then I've found that there is such situation and with
ScriptAlias /fcgi-bin "/usr/local/apache/share/fcgi-bin"
<Directory /usr/local/apache/share/fcgi-bin>
     AllowOverride None
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
</Directory>

Whithout any OPTIONS apache starts fastcgi application as CGI script...
PS: FastCGI can be run as CGI

>How-To-Repeat:
I've thing you'll found this problem in apache 1.3.6 with configuration the same as above
>Fix:
Posibly this is a ScriptAlias and mod_cgi bug, but I'm not shure.
I've spend 5 hour trying to found a error in my configuration, but I've found nothing....

In 
directory /cgi-bin
I've tried to use 
Options None
Options -ExecCGI

But there gives nothing!

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... let me get this straight.  You are complaining that
Apache executes scripts in /cgi-bin?  You told it to with the
ScriptAlias directive!  The ScriptAlias directive says treat
all files in this tree as CGIs, as the documentation clearly
states.  If you don't want that then don't use ScriptAlias.
