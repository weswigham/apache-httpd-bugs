>Description:
When making httpd, the final link gives this error:

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
/usr/bin/../lib/ld:
Archive: regex/libregex.a has no table of contents (not searched)
         add one with 'ar ts'
Unresolved:
regfree
regcomp
regexec
regerror
*** Error code 1 (bu21)


The make seems to have an error in it such that "ar" never gets run.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
do a "make clean; make; make lib" in the regex directory, then try
making apache again
