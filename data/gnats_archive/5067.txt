>Organization:
>Environment:
Windows 98 unpatched
Apache binary install
>Description:
Using http://your.server.name/server-status?refresh=N will refresh the
status every N seconds.
However, when setting N to 0 or omitting it, the server will serve updates
pages at very high speed.
I do not think this behaviour is intended, as calling just
server-status?refresh will only update at 1 second intervals, which will
not put too much load on the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://your.server.name/server-status?refresh=0
http://your.server.name/server-status?refresh=
>Fix:
modify the behaviour of ?refresh=0 and ?refresh= to that of ?refresh
