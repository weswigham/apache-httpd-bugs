>Environment:
Digital Unix (OSF/1) 4.0, gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Virtualhosts do not operate correctly.  The first virtualhost (and not the main
server) serves all requests.  This is due to get_addresses storing the ip addr
in a long int, which on an alpha is 64bit.  DEFAULT_VHOST_ADDR is also specified
as a long.
>How-To-Repeat:
just try to use virtualhosts on a platform with 64bit longs
>Fix:
change the type of my_addr in get_addresses (http_config.c) to a 32-bit type.
change the definition of DEFAULT_VHOST_ADDR to be 32-bit (i don't think this
is neccesary, but it might be)
