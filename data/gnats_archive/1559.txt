Linux 2.0.23 / Intel / Slackware distribution
>Description:
In "Apache: The definitive guide", page 92, it is said that both forms
"index.html.en" and "index.en.html" are accepted. After a day's testing work,
a short look at the source code showed this can't be true! The only accepted
for is "index.html.en".
It would be very nice to be able to call the language-dependent files
index_en.html, or index.html_en because many authoring tools replace the first
dot by an underscore, making it impossible to save a file called index.html.en !
"index.en.html" would also be better than "index.html.en" because this would
allow to make direct links to a specific language while keeping the automatic
content-type recognition with the ".html" suffix.
>How-To-Repeat:
Very simply!
Just create the files:
index.en.html  (does not work)
index.html.en  (works)
>Fix:
Well probably something to expand in the region of "getword", but I don't
know the Apache code well enough to suggest an "intelligent" way of fixing it

State-Changed-Why:
Hello. Can you explain why you think that this does
not work? If you telnet to your server and request
the page do you see a "Content-Language" header?
Can you put both of these files on a server which we
can access, for tesing?

It should work. Extensions (such as "en" and "html") can be
given in ANY order. Obviously Apache has to be told
about the extension for it to understand them (with,
for example, AddType and AddLanguage).

 It doesn't work because when the file is called "index.html.fr", then I get it
 andwhen it is called "index.fr.html", then I don't.
 Apache returns the "Content-Language" header the right way.
 If my french file is called index.html.fr, the Content-language is fr.
 If my file is called index.fr.html and I have a file index.html.en (english is my 2nd
 choice),
 then I get a Content-language: en with the english document.
 If my english document is called index.en.html, the server does not find the
 document.

 Obviously, I have 3 AddLanguage statements.
 
 Hope it helps

Are you making a request for "index", or a request for
"index.html" - note that if you're making a request for
simply "/", the DirectoryIndex is what gets substituted
first.
