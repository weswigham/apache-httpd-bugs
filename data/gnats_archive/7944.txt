CYGWIN_NT-4.0 WAPME-244 1.1.8(0.34/3/2) 2001-01-31 10:08 i686 unknown

Cygwin 1.1.8 running on WinNT4sp6.
>Description:
Bill Stoddard has suggested to check this and it produced a SECURITY whole for the Cygwin 1.x platform!

On WinNT and Win2000 operating systems running Apache for Cygwin requesting users may circumvent any <Directory> restrictions using Windows canonical (shorten) filenames (based on 8.3 format). This problem arises from the underlying Cygwin 1.x layer which seems to make no differences how the file/dir is addressed.
>How-To-Repeat:
restrict a specific directory under DocumentRoot, i.e.
 
  # httpd.conf
  <Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/foobardir>
    Order deny, allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from 10.0.0.2
  </Directory>

Requesting /foobardir from 10.0.0.1 gets 403 Forbidden.
Requesting /foobar~1 from 10.0.0.1 gets whatever the dir contains (indexing, etc.)



>Fix:
I'll check the sources to see if there is an implementation within the Windows specific parts and incorporate that for the Cygwin platform within the Unix based sources.

Patch will be posted to new-httpd@apache.org.
