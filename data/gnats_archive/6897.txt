>Description:
At http://www.casdn.neu.edu/graduate/lead.shtml, if a pdf file is accessed,
the next page will have garbage preceding it. 

It could also be duplicated by going to http://www.casdn.neu.edu/graduate/pdf00-01,
accessing any of the larger pdf files, and then going to a regular html
page on the same server. Clicking reload would fix the problem.

The problem happened with IE as well as Netscape 4.7x.

Also, trying to load a second pdf file, rather than a plain html file would 
sometimes cause Acrobat to stop responding.

I went back to Apache 1.3.12, which doesn't seem to exibit the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:
At this time, you can't, as I went back to Apache 1.3.12, which doesn't seem 
to have the problem. I would be willing to try putting the server up on a different port
temporarily so that you can see the problem, if you like.
>Fix:
This looks like some sort of memory allocation problem.
