>Description:
Moving from 1.3.14 to 1.3.19, CGI programs stopped working, returning immediately.  `truss'ing the running apache showed the child manipulating the file descriptors from the pipe onto descriptors 1, 0, and 2, closing a bunch of files in the 7-40 range, and then, critically, closing fd 0, so the child never got the data from the parent.

A bit of dbx'ing later, showed this fd 0 was being closed in fd_cleanup, the fd being noted in child_main: ap_note_cleanups_for_fd(ptrans, csd), with csd being the descriptor from the ap_accept.

I don't know what I've done differently such that I'm having this trouble where others aren't, but it doesn't seem to be an error for this to be 0 (or indeed <= 2), and the code looks dangerous.
>How-To-Repeat:
Tough to say, since I can't *not* repeat it ...
>Fix:
My solution, which seems to work fine, is to insert an ap_kill_cleanups_for_fd before each `dup', and change ap_kill_cleanups_for_fd to descend into sub pools as cleanup_for_exec does.  I'm obviously nervous about this latter change, but killing the cleanups before the dups surely has to be right.  (That, or change the logic to cleanup_for_exec before the dups.)

Anyway, here's my patch for what it's worth, no doubt mangled by this form ...

diff -c3 -r1.1 alloc.c

ap_kill_cleanup(p, (void *) (long) fd, fd_cleanup);

+       ap_kill_cleanups_for_fd(p, fd);
}

if (pipe_out) {
close(out_fds[0]);
+           ap_kill_cleanups_for_fd(permanent_pool, STDOUT_FILENO);
dup2(out_fds[1], STDOUT_FILENO);
close(out_fds[1]);
}

if (pipe_in) {
close(in_fds[1]);
+           ap_kill_cleanups_for_fd(permanent_pool, STDIN_FILENO);
dup2(in_fds[0], STDIN_FILENO);
close(in_fds[0]);
}

if (pipe_err) {
close(err_fds[0]);
+           ap_kill_cleanups_for_fd(permanent_pool, STDERR_FILENO);
dup2(err_fds[1], STDERR_FILENO);
close(err_fds[1]);
}

I guess similar things should be done for other OSes.
