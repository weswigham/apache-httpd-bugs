Uname -a: Linux tsmithi 2.4.4-4GB i686

Suse Linux v7.2 Preloaded apache 1.3 from install disks
>Description:
I have this is httpd.conf:
<Directory "/usr/local/httpd/tsmithii">
  Order Deny,Allow
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "TSmithII Secured Area"
  AuthUserFile "/password"
</Directory>
(The password file is located in root, filename "passoword")
There is no security box that appears asking for a username and password and no appearant change from a normal unprotected directory.(This server is proected with MOD_SSL for https:// transfers)
>How-To-Repeat:
There is no outside URL for this server. There will be at some point, but it will run secured on MOD_SSL
>Fix:
I type in EXACTLY what was written in the support files on your server and made sure that mod_auth_digest and mod_auth were both installed. I can find no error exept for the fact that it doesn't work.
