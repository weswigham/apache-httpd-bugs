FreeBSD2.2.2
gcc version 2.7.2.1
>Description:
Apache will start and run correctly.  After a few minutes, one process will begin to take up huge amounts of processor time and around 4 times the normal memory.  The system does run a lot of CGI, but the memory/processor would all be handled by the cgi process, I assume.  These processes also take a long time to die.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The only solution we have at this time is to run a script which checks to see if any httpd processes are lasting longer then a minute.  The script then will restart apache if this occurrs.

State-Changed-Why:
Have you read the htdocs/manual/stopping.html documentation?
This sounds like a classic problem where you're improperly
killing/restarting your server.

What operating system are you using?

 To kill off the server we kill off the parent process then run the httpd 
 on the httpd.conf file.

Comment-Added:
Do you use NFS at all?  If so try using the LockFile directive
to move the lock file to a local disk.
