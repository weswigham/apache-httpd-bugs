[Thu Dec 16 00:45:16 1999] [emerg] (45)Deadlock situation detected/avoided: fcntl: F_SETLKW: Error getting accept lock, exiting!  Perhaps you need to use the
LockFile directive to place your lock file on a local disk!
[Thu Dec 16 00:45:16 1999] [alert] Child 18355 returned a Fatal error...
Apache is exiting!
--------------
Start Note : None of the file systems is a NFS.
this is a take from the error_log, it's always logged when the crash happens.
Nor NFS neither NIS are being used, I even stopped statd and lockd .
The LockFile directive was initialy commented, when this started to happen, I uncommneted it, it didn't help, and there was no lock file written to the file system anyways.
