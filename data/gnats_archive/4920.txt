Linux 2.2.9 - Red Hat
gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
When a conditional (if-modified-since or if-none-match) request is made for
a DirectoryIndex (i.e., GET / , GET /foo/), it will be logged as a 200 response,
not a 304.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. configure Apache with mod_log_config and mod_dir
2. set a typical LogFormat - 
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{referer}i\" \"%{user-agent}i\""
3. Make a manual request for an DirectoryIndex object - e.g., 
GET / HTTP/1.0
Note the ETag and Last-Modified served.
4. Try conditional requests using the above info - it will be logged as 200, 
even though it is served as 304.
5. Now try it with the complete path to the underlying object (e.g., /index.html)
- it works fine.
