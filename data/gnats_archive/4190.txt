SunOS sif.ttsg.com 5.7 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
# /usr/local/bin/gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/2.8.1/specs
gcc version 2.8.1

>Description:
On every machine I own, I put in the base configuration :

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/"


Then, in every Virtual Host I put :
ScriptAlias /lcgi-bin/ "/local/wwwcust/user/lcgi-bin/"
<Location /lcgi-bin>
Action cgi-wrapper /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/user
SetHandler cgi-wrapper
</Location>

What this does is then take :
www.domain.com/lcgi-bin/cgitorun

and change it to :

/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/user/lcgi-bin/cgitorun

and runs it.  On EVERY machine except this one, where I get :

httpd: [Sat Apr  3 12:27:24 1999] [warn] [client 204.141.84.129] handler "cgi-wr
apper" not found for: /local/wwwcust/user/lcgi-bin/cgitorun

HOWEVER, it does work.  Why am I getting this problem?
