Win95b. Use the binary code directly.
>Description:
I have a very high traffic to this PC, more than 50 hits in peak hours. I have taken the advice and upgrade to winsocket2. And to avoid the FIN_WAIT_2 problem, I set the keep-alive to Off. This two measures seem to improve the performance a little bit, since the server survived the peak hours last time. But yesterday it's down with blue screen. I checked the stat report of my website. It shows that the server was dead at peak hours. I use the Win95 Apache for http server only. 
And I have tried using other windows webservers. I met the same problem.

So here is a question. How can I improve the stability of the system when using Apache. What other parameters should I change to control the traffic?

I've viewd the PR database carefully. And 3220 is the only related one. I also know that it's still open.

Hope to get some solutions soon.
>How-To-Repeat:
I think if you have Win95b, winsock1, and a very high traffic, you would be very easy to get the bluescreen in peak hours.
>Fix:
Don't know.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm afraid we really can't help you much.  You say you have
the same problem with other web servers, indicating that it
is likely a problem with 95.  95 is not designed to be a server
and will not operate well under load.  I am not suprised that
Win95 can't handle a significant load.
