Each time I try to load any page from my server I get the error:

Your Browser sent a malformed request 

What can I do?  If you are reading this please try your best to solve my problem because I couldn't use apache.

 Are you sure you aren't running some third party proxy on your system?
 
 If you stop Apache do you get the same thing?  If so, it has nothing to do
 with Apache.

 Sir,
 
 I've discovered that it actually happens with every server.  Do you
 have an idea how I can solve the problem?  What do you mean by a 3rd
 party proxy? Is it a protocol or service listed in the Network Section
 of the control panel?
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
   
 Bernard

Comment-Added:

If it happens with every server, then it isn't an Apache
problem -- unless you're going through an Apache proxy.
It would be particularly useful if you can tell us just
what browser you *are* using..

 Sir,
 
 I'm afraid it happens with both Communicator and IE4.
 I'm using Win98 at the moment and it didn't happen when I used Win95. 
 However i don't think that this is the cause of the problem.
 
 Thanks for your great help.

State-Changed-Why:
OK, well in your first post you said:
"Each time I try to load any page from my server I get the error.."
Since you are trying to debug the server go to that machine
that you have Apache installed on, and start a browser, then check
the browsers proxy settings.  Under Netscape 4.6 go to
Edit->Preference->Advanced->Proxy then click direct
connection to the Internet.
Then in the browser enter
http://127.0.0.1
Report back on your findings....if this doesn't work
then add this line to your \windows\hosts file
127.0.0.1 localhost
And try with your browser again.

 In one last valiant effort, see if you stack is socksified.
 (You would most likely know if this is the case) if it
 is please try to reproduce your problems with the normal
 windows stack.  Also remember for us to assist you, the
 more information you provide the better.
 
 Is there a guru near you that might be able to explicitly
 walk you through each step...as it sounds like you
 have something configured incorrectly, and doesn't sound like
 an Apache problem.  So I am going to close this PR. If you
 can precisely explain the problem you are having and how it
 is Apache's fault then please open another PR.  Thanks
