NextStep 3.3 with Developer 3.3 under HPPA
>Description:
Under NextStep the procedure 'strdup' is not defined in the normal c-library
but in a special 'gnu'-library (libg++.a).
If you compile the package and it comes to linking all together, the compiler
says that it cannot find 'strdup' and exits.

In the file 'src/Configure' is a large case-statement which adds some
compiler-options for every supported plattform.
For NextStep (search for '*-next-nextstep*') just add the line
'LIBS=$LIBS -lg++' and all works fine.

 Apache provides it's own strdup on next.
 
 Exactly what error are you getting?  Please show the last dozen or so
 lines before the compile stops.
 
 There were some issues with some of the programs in the support directory
 in 1.3b6 with strdup, but the server itself should compile fine.
