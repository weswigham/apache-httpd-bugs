>Description:
I have a rewrite rule of 
RewriteRule     ^/scripts/(.*)  http://www2.northgate.net/cgi-bin/$1.exe [T=application/x-httpd-cgi,L]

the rewrite causes a normal POST turn into a GET, hence the cgi 
info is lost.

The same thing appears to happen for a simple version of the above
using Redirect.
 
see problem report 4247, I beleive this to be the same problem..
>How-To-Repeat:
set up two web servers, one has the POST form on it the other
has the cgi programs. redirect the local cgi directory using
mod_rewrite to the second web server (the one with the cgi scripts)	
>Fix:
look for the request_method prior to the rewrit rule being applied
and try not to munge it.
