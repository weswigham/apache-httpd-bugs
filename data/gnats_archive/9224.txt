>Description:
When using the below line in my httpd.conf
BrowserMatchNoCase ".*MSIE.*"   nokeepalive

I see that the nokeepalive directive disabling keepalive.  However the environment variable in perl still reports
HTTP_CONNECTION = Keep-Alive

I don't believe this should be happening.

 I found out more problems with setenvif
 
 
 
 If I use
 SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*"  "nokeepalive" "ssl-unclean-shutdown" "downgrade-1.0" "force-response-1.0"
 It stores the ENV properly
 
 If I use
 SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*"  nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
 Then all periods seem to be converted into underscores somehow.
 
 And inside of mod_perl dashes are also converted into underscores in %ENV.

State-Changed-Why:
HTTP_* environment variables are what the client sends.  They have nothing to do with how the server is responding.  So it is completely correct for the HTTP_* variables to be the same even if the server is deciding to respond differently.

And yes, environment variables passed to CGIs, mod_perl, etc. are converted based on the rules in the CGI spec which does change things to _, etc.
