>Description:
Test Envronment :
-----------------
platform : see above
- index.html file in document root
- Socrates test tool configured to get this file. Various settings on number of 
threads make no difference.

Repeating to get the same page using the multithreaded pounder locks the server
 process. Apparently connections stay open. On my machine this happens when the
pages/sec > 12, using 5 client threads. Typically after 300-600 requests.

The server process gets killed by "Ma" who starts a new one, which locks up, 
gets killed by Ma, ... , well, you know : you guys wrote it ;-).

I found this with 1.3b5, 1.3b6 binary release, 1.3b6 recompiled.

This problem was introduced in 1.3b5. Apache 1.3b3 does not exhibit this. I 
pushed it using 45 threads getting 70 pages/sec. I let it run to > 50000 pages : 
no glitch, still same server process.

If you need more details, I'll be happy to try to accomodate. 

I have setup CVS and can track the CVS tree if this is helpful to give feedback 
if needed.

regards,

Peter Tillemans 

BTW : Socrates web test tool can be found at www.morphtech.com. It is postcard-ware
and a test version is freely available.
>How-To-Repeat:
see above.
>Fix:
Revert to 1.3b3 with CGI filehadle leak fixed :-(. 
That's how I "fixed" it.

Are you using piped logs?  Just today we have implemented a
set of fixed for child spawning under Win32.  It would be
great if you could pull down a CVS snapshot from
http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/ and let us know if you still
see this problem, though the child_spawning problem isn't
yet fixed in mod_rewrite.

 No, just a plain ol' "logs/rewritelog" file.

State-Changed-Why:
[Response from submitter..]
RewriteLogLevel 0 --> no problems on any version

RewriteLogLevel 2 --> httpd locks up after 200-1000 requests 

locks on 1.3b5, 1.3b6(binary), 1.3b6(source), 1.3b7(binary), 1.3b7(source)

At least one CVS compiled version did NOT exhibit this (or I did not wait
long enough) and I sent a jubilant "It's fixed" letter. 

However recompiling it statically (to work better on Win95) --> locks up.

I tried with 5 and 25 client threads, but no difference observable

sorry for the bad news,

Peter Tillemans
