>Description:
This was generated by the server info. It is a part of http_core.c info
There are not closed brackets < >. Maybe it is just a little cosmetic bug, maybe
an memory allocation bug. Or maybe my bad configuration. Please, if you find a time
let me now what's going on. The same I found in mod_core.c and mod_access.c infos.

access.conf 
     <Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs> 
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride None
     </DirectorySymL 
     <Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bingt;& 
       AllowOverride None
       Options None
     </Directory/htt 
>How-To-Repeat:
I'm sorry now, we are running Intranet just now
>Fix:
CHeck the output syntax or the memory allocation
