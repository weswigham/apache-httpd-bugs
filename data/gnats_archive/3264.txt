>Description:
I'm trying to get HyperNews running under Apache 1.3.1, and running into
what seems to be an suexec problem.

HyperNews sets up lots of links to its core perl programs, and I keep
getting "can't stat program" errors in suexec's logs.

As far as I can tell, all the permissions are correct, and we've passed
all the security checks in suexec, and then we get to the line of code
(suexec.c) that reads:

/*
     * Error out if we cannot stat the program.
     */
    if (((lstat(cmd, &prg_info)) != 0) || (S_ISLNK(prg_info.st_mode))) {
        log_err("cannot stat program: (%s)\n", cmd);
        exit(117);
    }

am I wrong, or does this code prevent suexec from executing a program via
a link - even when the link points within allowable directories? or am I
missing something?

is this a bug? a feature?  are there any workarounds?
