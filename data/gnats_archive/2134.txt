Compiling Apache-httpd w/ PHP3-0C4.
It seems that configure puts the "-lsocket" option BEFORE the option
"-lmysqlclient" . This will produce the following link error:

'getservbyname'first referenced in file modules/php3/modphp3.

>How-To-Repeat:
Try to embed php3 module, then try to re-link httpd
>Fix:
Put -lsocket AFTER the -lmysqlclient; linking will work

State-Changed-Why:

Since this problem only surfaces with libraries and
modules that are not part of the base Apache package,
we can't help you with it.  Please contact the mod_php
maintainer; I suspect this may have been fixed for the
version that works with Apache 1.3.1.
