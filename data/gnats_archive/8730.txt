>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 7.2, apache-1.3.20.i386.rpm
>Description:
After client browers use sites such as Lycos chat through the proxy and disconnect, a apache sup process still as I/O activity between the sub process and Lycos server; there is not extra entries in /var/log/httpd/access.  Restarting Apache breaks the link.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use an IE 5.x or 6.x web browser to logon and chat in a Apache chat room.

>Fix:
A check needs it be added to end the sub process when the browsers socket has been closed.
