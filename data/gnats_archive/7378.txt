>Organization:
>Environment:
SCO OPENSERVER 5.0.x
SCO_SV 3.2 5.0.6 i386
>Description:
This is actually a problem between Apache and SCO, although the only time I've ever seen any effect from it was using mod_jserv.

Even though SCO's documentation says it returns EAGAIN on a read that would block, it actually returns EWOULDBLOCK.  This throws off read completion checking in the Apache src/main/buff.c and src/main/http_protocol.c modules.  Adding a check for EWOULDBLOCK fixes the problem.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:

In Apache's src/main/buff.c module

734c734
<     else if (rv == -1 && errno != EAGAIN) {
---
>     else if (rv == -1 && (errno != EAGAIN) && (errno != EWOULDBLOCK)) {
1054c1054
<           if (errno != EAGAIN && errno != EINTR) {
---
>           if (errno != EAGAIN && errno != EINTR && errno != EWOULDBLOCK) {
1088c1088,1089
<       while (rv == -1 && (errno == EINTR || errno == EAGAIN)

>       while (rv == -1 &&
>               (errno == EINTR || errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK)

<           if (errno != EINTR && errno != EAGAIN) {

>           if (errno != EINTR && errno != EAGAIN && errno != EWOULDBLOCK) {
1128c1129
<       if (errno != EAGAIN) {
---
>       if (errno != EAGAIN && errno != EWOULDBLOCK) {

In Apache's src/main/http_protocol.c module:

2312c2312
<             if (n < 0 && errno != EAGAIN)
---
>             if (n < 0 && errno != EAGAIN && errno != EWOULDBLOCK)
