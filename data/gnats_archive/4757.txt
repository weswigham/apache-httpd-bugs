>Release:        1.36 and Jserv final 1.0
>Environment:
jdk 1.1.7 on Linux (blackdown), Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher or 
Netscape Communicator 4.5 or higher on Linux and WinN
>Description:
Running an applet within the Netscape browser versions named above 
cannot submit "POST" parameters to a servlet URL.

Running the same applet within HotJava Browser 3.0 or MS Explorer(WIN NT) 4.0x
with the java com. kit works well.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
The problem is based on to the Content-type linked with a HttpRequest send 
by different browsers. Netscape browsers set as content-type "multipart/form-data",
other browsers set as content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

However, Jserv requires the content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
in order to decode "POST" - Parameter (see org.apache.jserv.JServConnection.java, l
ine 768).
Fix: change the code that netscape content-types are allowed.

 Netscape needs to follow the HTML/HTTP specs. This is a bug in netscape and
 not a bug in Apache JServ.
