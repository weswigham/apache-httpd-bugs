<pre>

In order to not have to modify each script when porting CGI scripts to different 
platforms, there ought to be a way to override the shebang line to specify where 
a given CGI app lies.

Proposed syntax in server config, virtual host, .htaccess:
    CGIOverride {<full-path-to-app>|off} <file-ext-list>
or
    ShebangOverride {<full-path-to-app>|off} <file-ext-list>

Eg:
CGIOverride c:/perl/bin/perl.exe .pl .cgi  # override shebang line on .pl and .cgi scripts
CGIOverride off .cgi                       # turn shebang override back off for this dir (.htaccess)

Possibly also:
CGIOverride c:/perl/bin/perl.exe form.pl   # override a single script (probably only used in .htaccess)

</pre>
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Possible changes to ap_execve.c, util_script.c, mod_cgi.c, etc. to implement, 
plus addition of syntax above.

State-Changed-Why:
The ScriptInterpreterSource directive is available in 1.3.6
for Win32. With it, you can use the registry to associate
scripts to interpreters based on the script's extension.

For Unix, you can use symbolic links to allow scripts to see
the interpreter where they expect.

Thanks for using Apache.

 This solves nothing for me since the Perl I want to use is not in the 
 registry.  It is a specific solution to a general problem.  I supplied 
 a syntax that would have been much more general to use and would have 
 worked on all systems, not just Windows, eg:
 
         <runtime-directive> <full-path-to-exe> <ext-list> ...
 
 where <runtime-directive> could be:
 
         AddCGIHandler, CGIOverride, OverrideShebang, or ShebangOverride, etc.
 
 Since you've already added new syntax, maybe a later upgrade from this
 syntax:
 
         ScriptInterpreterSource {registry|script}
 
 to this:
 
         ScriptInterpreterSource {registry|script|full-path-to-interpreter} .ext ...
 
 would be an easier upgrade to get to a more general solution. Eg:
         
         ScriptInterpreterSource registry .pl .cgi
         ScriptInterpreterSource script .pl .cgi
         ScriptInterpreterSource C:/perl/bin/perl.exe .pl .cgi
 
 There are directives that already use this syntax (such as: AddIcon, AddHandler), 
 so I assume there is parsing logic to handle it already that just needs to be 
 copied.
 
 Thanks for listening, thanks for the current solution (which I'm sure will help 
 many folks who are using the registry - like Activestate Perl users) and let me 
 know what you think about making this a more general solution that will help the 
 rest of the users (who may not be using the registry or may even hate it like I 
 do :)),

Yes, you need to create an association in the registry yourself if
your interpreter doesn't do it for you. The easiest way I've found to 
do this is to try to execute the script, at which point Windows will 
let you choose an interpreter for the script.

I'll suspend the bug report, meaning someone may consider it as a future 
feature. However, this probably won't be implemented, because there 
are more generic solutions on both Windows and Unix which provide this 
functionality and also work for programs other than Apache. OS/2 might
find this feature useful though; I don't know.
