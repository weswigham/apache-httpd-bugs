Apache 1.3.20, Running as service "Logged On As" a particular user
PHP 4.0.5
>Description:
Apache starts and runs normally.

BUT, when I hit a PHP parsed page that uses ODBC connections, I get the following error message:

   Drwtsn32.exe - DLL Initialization Failed
   Initialization of the dynamic link library F:\WINNT\system32\USER32.dll failed.
   The process is terminating abnormally.


This only happens when I have the Apache Service "Log On As" a separate user via "This Account."  There's no problem if I have the Apache Service "Log On As" the "System Account."

The special user account in question has full control over all files and directories in the F:\Program Files\Apache\* tree.

Everyone has read access on all files and directories in the F:\WINNT\* tree.

I followed the instructions in the "User Account for Apache Service to Run As (NT/2000)" section of http://httpd.apache.org/docs/win_service.html and then rebooted the machine.  Still no luck.

Nothing shows up in the error.log.

Posted a message regarding this to comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows on 6/5/01.  No one responded.  Similarly, searched Google's archive and found nothing.

Your looking into this would be greatly appreaciated,

State-Changed-Why:

As a matter of fact, I believe I did respond.

We don't provide support for ODBC.

describes some of the common problems (sorry, can't validate
the url right now, since ms's name server appears down.)
