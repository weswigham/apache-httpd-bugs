>Environment:
I am running Stronghold/2.4.1 Apache/1.3.3 C2NetEU/2409 
BSDI 4.0.1
>Description:
Unable to start server if there are too many log files in the conf file.  
The error in the log file says;
[warn] (24)Too many open files: unable to open a file descriptor above 15, you may need to increase the n
umber of descriptors

I have tried using this;

EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DNO_SLACK -DFD_SETSIZE=1024

I also tried -FD_SETSIZE=1024 but gcc didn't recoginize it.

I have also put unlimit openfiles in my sh script that starts the server. 
>How-To-Repeat:
It is easy to repeat.  I can send you my httpd.conf or you should be able to
duplicate it by putting in about 80 virtual domains each with 4 log file names
specified.  Each log file being unique to that virtual domain.  That should be 
about 320 log files.
>Fix:
Not a clue.  Find a way to allow more open files.

State-Changed-Why:
See http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/descriptors.html
or maybe you already have.  There's nothing we can do
in apache, you have to rebuild your kernel or otherwise
change your system to supply more fds.  Or change your
configuration to use fewer.
