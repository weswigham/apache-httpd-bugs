I have just installed Cold Fusion Administrator 4 and Apache server 1-3-9. The main problem is that to try and configure the Cold Fusion Administrator, whenever I try to access the page. The server returns the alert 'save to disk' or 'open from here'.
I have put in the right CF module into Apache. HELP PLEASE
