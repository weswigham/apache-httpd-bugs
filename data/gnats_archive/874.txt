gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
I would like an option, that I cannot find in the current web documentation,
that will allow the proxy module to serve a document from the proxy cache when
the original server is not actually available. I would like apache to serve
this document with a one liner at the top stating that the original server is
not availible, that the document is only being served from the proxy cache and
when the document was last checked. Thankyou for listening.

State-Changed-Why:
There is a whole host of "freshness" attributes which HTTP/1.1
suggests a proxy can give to cached content.  When we proceed
to implement 1.1 in mod_proxy, we'll definitely consider this.
Thanks!
