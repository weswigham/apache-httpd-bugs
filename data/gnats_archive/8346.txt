State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Sun Sep 16 15:03:33 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
Please see Apple's site - we do not distribute their altered
version of Apache 1.3 *server* (not a browser at all), since
they made several HFS-specific changes that have not been
submitted for inclusion in the official Apache distribution.
