Apache 1.3.2 was already installed as desktop application and worked fine.
>Description:
The Icon to call apache -d <path> -i for installing Apache as Windows NT service
contained only the string "Arbeitsplatz" and not the necessary command.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install Apache 1.3.9 on WinNT4 SP4 after having installed Apache 1.3.2
and check the corresponding icon content.
>Fix:
I did execute the corresponding command manually (I still had Apache 1.3.2
installed on the same PC to look how it worked there), and thus got the
Service running.
I don't know how this entry can break - maybe I must not have several Apaches
installed at the same time? Then the installation program ought to tell me so
- but right now 1.3.2-desktop and 1.3.9-service coexist without problems ...
