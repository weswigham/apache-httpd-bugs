>Description:
Trying to access http://38.211.174.34/ through mod_proxy, returns an error from
the proxy: 
        Proxy Error
        The proxy server could not handle this request. 
        Reason: Address not found 

Accessing this server through a CERN httpd 3.0a proxy works fine.

In the proxy-errors file, there are messages corresponding to attempts
to access this URL, which look like:

        [Tue May 13 13:08:48:32 1997] Invalid URI in request

An excerpt from our configuration file follows, with the names changed:

State-Changed-Why:
As we've discussed, this problem indicates a reverse DNS
lookup problem on the local network. We use gethostbyname()
and gethostbyaddr() in the proxy to insure getting through
to possibly overloaded multihomed hosts. In future, we
will provide a mechanism to turn this feature off for those
who desire to run that way.
