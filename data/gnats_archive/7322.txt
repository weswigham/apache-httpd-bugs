>Description:
the apache support program apxs builds with funny stuff in the configuration variables
## my $CFG_PREFIX        = q(@prefix@);            # substituted via APACI install
## my $CFG_SBINDIR       = q(@sbindir@);           # substituted via APACI install
## my $CFG_INCLUDEDIR    = q(@includedir@);        # substituted via APACI install
## my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = q(@libexecdir@);        # substituted via APACI install
## my $CFG_SYSCONFDIR    = q(@sysconfdir@);        # substituted via APACI install

which causes subsequent calls to apxs to fail (e.g. php4.0.4pl1). when i replaced the above lines with the exact path from my configuration everything worked fine ...
 
my $CFG_PREFIX        = q(/usr/local/httpd);            # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_SBINDIR       = q(/usr/local/httpd/bin);           # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_INCLUDEDIR    = q(/usr/local/httpd/include);        # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = q(/usr/local/httpd/libexec);        # substituted via APACI install
my $CFG_SYSCONFDIR    = q(/usr/local/httpd/conf);        # substituted via APACI install
>How-To-Repeat:
just try to build apache and php with DSO support, which results in a error message of the php configure script (usage message from apxs).
>Fix:
dunno, seems to be some error when apxs is built...
