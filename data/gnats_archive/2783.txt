clean build from FreeBSD ports collection.
>Description:
I've seen other PRs bearing on this topic.  I've exhausted the config files, 
and can find nothing ... so out of desperation I checked bug database and was
reassured by my company.  To wit, it appears that #exec cmd= is discarded.
(See example ...)

Example text;

<link rev="made" href="mailto:dannyman@dannyland.org">
</head><body text="#000000" link="#3333ff" vlink="#990000" bgcolor="<!--#exec
cmd=".bin/randcolor" -->">

<!--#exec cmd="/bin/date" 
   -->

<h1 align=center>29 July, 1998</h1>
<hr width="50%">

Renders to the browser as;

<link rev="made" href="mailto:dannyman@dannyland.org">
</head><body text="#000000" link="#3333ff" vlink="#990000" bgcolor="">



<h1 align=center>29 July, 1998</h1>
<hr width="50%">

Just because I've heard of an occasional bug in FreeBSD sh, I tried;
stumpy 22:56 ~> echo "/bin/date" | /bin/sh
Tue Aug  4 23:04:03 CDT 1998

Later on down the page, the following parses great;
<address>This document last modified <!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"-->
&lt;<a href="mailto:dannyman@dannyland.org">dannyman@dannyland.org</a>&gt;
</address>

Oh, I'm using XBitHack full along with the Options Include and the conventional 
.shtml handler stuff ...
>Fix:
I can find no IncludesNOEXEC or whatever it is anywhere, but my uneducated
hunch would maybe investigate some Options configuration loophole.

 Erm... are the above two things really the exact things you are trying to
 use?
 
 Neither are valid; ".bin" doesn't make much sense, and the second one
 shouldn't have the new line before the -->.

 Yes they are.  The first one makes perfect sense, because <cwd>/.bin is the
 directory from which I'm executing randcolor.  It works on another host.  The
 newline I popped in there just to test the rule of having whitespace before
 the end comment.  With or without the newline though, the server parses that
 string, and leaves nothing in its place.  I'd guess maybe there's a bug in
 capturing the stdout of the exec?  (Yes, though, I popped /bin/date in there
 to test an absolute pathname just in case the directory environment had
 changed for #exec.)
 
 Have you any suggestions for an #exec that should without question work? :)
 
 I'll try setting up 1.3 on my workstation here when I have some spare time,
 and see if there's any difference.
