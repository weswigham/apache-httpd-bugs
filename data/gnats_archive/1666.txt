>Description:
When using basic authentication Apache requires the scheme token in the
Authorization header to be exactly "Basic". If you send for example

  Authorization: basic ...

the authorization will fail and message "client used wrong authentication
scheme" will be logged.

Note this problem is already fixed for digest in PR# 1599.
>How-To-Repeat:
The easiest is to try and access a protected document using telnet and give
an auth header as described above.
>Fix:
All comparisons are already case insensitive except for one. Here is the
patch for the last one:
