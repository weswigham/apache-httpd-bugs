>Description:
Hello, 

I try to install "Apache JServ", which needs "jsdk.jar", 
and I failed to retrieve "jsdk.jar" with Java SDK 2*. 

On which side is the problem or the solution, 
on the former, the latter or another side ? 

Thank you for any helpful advice, 

         Marc
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Create again or assemble the elements of "jsdk.jar" 
before to associate and attach it/them,
with the install setup of "Apache JServ" ?
(check local "jsdk.jar" when setup running)
