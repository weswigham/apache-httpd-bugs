State-Changed-Why:
I think you misunderstand the way the Internet works.

206.85.117.142 has nothing to do with anything; it is a
dialin at earthlink.net.  I think you had better talk
to your network administrator or service provider to
clear up your confusion... Apache has nothing to do with
anything that you are talking about.  Apache is software
used for web servers.  If someone somewhere uses it and
something is broken, it has nothing to do with us.

 I understand that when I enter Global.nws.net it should look it up and
 connect me to SCVONLINE BBS in the US, but instead it is looking it up
 and connects me to your web page, and to machine 206.85.117.142.  Many
 people aroung the world depend on Global providing them with echomail
 networks, via Telnet, and to find you in their place has already halted
 the flowof network mail between the US and the UK for the 5 echonets I
 Hub for, I can only assume that the problem is the same with the other
 parts of the world that rely on Global as the World HUB.  If you are
 not, as you claim at fault then pass my notes to earthlink.net as it is
 VERY rude to steal someone elses name.
