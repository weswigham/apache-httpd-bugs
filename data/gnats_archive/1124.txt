# Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess how many

# handle the current load, plus a few spare servers to handle transient# load spikes (e.g., multiple simultaneous requests # from a single Netscape browser).
# It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
# for a request.  If there are fewer than MinSpareServers, it creates
# a new spare.  If there are more than MaxSpareServers, some of the# spares die off.  These values are probably OK for most sites ---

>Description:
According to the below entries in my access.conf:

<Location /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs>
# Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
Options None
AllowOverride None
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from all
</Location>

<Location /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin>
AllowOverride None
Options Indexes
order allow,deny
allow from all
deny from all
</Location>

<Location /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/test>
<Limit Get Put Post>
 order deny,allow
 deny from all
 allow from all
 require valid-user
 AuthUserFile /opt/local/etc/httpd/passwd/passwd
 AuthName Timecard
 AuthType Basic
</Limit>
</Location>

Users should be able to: 

Get denied complete access to the websites document root (http://timecard/)

Get into and able to view the index of http://timecard/cgi-bin directory

Get prompted for a password authentication for http://timecard/test/ 

But instead what happens:

Every yahoo gets complete, non-authenticated access to http://timecard/test and 
access to http://timecard

Browsing access to http://timecard/cgi-bin/ is forbidden.

It is almost as if the access.conf file is completely ignored.

>How-To-Repeat:
Unfortunately, http://timecard is on a non-accessable intranet.
>Fix:
I've been pulling my hair out.  I copied these conf files from another apache 1.2.0 server.  User authentication worked just AOK for that one.

The ownership of the conf files was set at root/other on that other server, but I tried that as well.

I must have some sort of setting or flag somewhere that basically tells apache to forget about the access.conf file.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Sep 11 17:54:31 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
This is a configuration question, not a bug report.  We
can not help all 600,000 Apache users configure their system.
Please ask on the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
newsgroup, as directed in the instructions.

Briefly, you have many configuration errors.  Some of
them:
     - you refer to /opt in some places and /usr in others
     - you say "deny from all" then "allow from all".  With
the order deny,allow, that means everyone gets access.
     - you can't do directory indexes for ScriptAliased
directories; even if you could, your cgi-bin is in /opt
and you are restricting /usr.  Even if one is a symlink
to another, you can't mix the two.
     - Your "Limit Get Post Put" is broken because methods
are case sensitive (eg. GET, not Get).  If you want to limit
all methods, simply remove the Limit directives.

You really need to look at your config files in more detail
and ask yourself why you are doing each thing.  Oh, and Location directives and Directory directives do different things.  Directory is what you want, not Location.    Read the manual.
