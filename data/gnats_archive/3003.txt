This is because your HTML is buggy.  Please take a look at
such things before thinking the server is broken.

Your main page references maincust.shtml and customer.html,
neither of which exist, but Navigator lists to the refresh
and loads the page referenced there while IE doesn't.

   Thank you for such a quick reply , I have check and worked on this problem for two
 weeks now
 the html has been the same for 6months and the pages were just copied over from my older
 version
 of apache ver 1.2.4 so i know its not a html bug problem and i also hav 8 different
 machines with
 browsers on them and found that on the few i run 95 and NT on within my local network do
 fine since
 there in my own subnet. I have 5 different sites all written by 5 different companies
 with there own html, So i know its not an html problem ....because non of them work with
 correctly
 If just one of them were flakey i would have to agree but thats not the case ...
 try www.htlaser.com and www.treehouseenterprises.com and www.dealerstrim.com these sites
 all worked fine with 1.2.4 ...I tried to upgrade earlier with 1.3.0 and had the same
 problem..
 But im determined to try and get this all running with the latest release...
 Can you help...
    Thanks In Advance..
                         Pat Beaven

 Exactly what version of MSIE are you using?  Are you sure you aren't using
 a proxy?  They all work fine for me, except the original one that doesn't
 work because of the broken HTML.

   version 3.02 and 3.0 have been tried and dont work for any site..
 Yep Im sure Im not using a proxy server...
 
 The error you get about error no /maincust.html is only when im trying to access a virtual
 domain
 and not the primary domain.. The maincust.html is part of the default domain for
 www.safehaven.net
 It seems to work fine.. just the virtual domains dont..

 The only error I get is accessing www.mythicalrealms.com.  That error is
 because you have some broken HTML that IE and Navigator parse differently.
 IE lsitens to your frameset that tells it to load /maincust.shml and
 /customer.html.  Neither of those files exist.  Netscape can't access
 them, IE can't access them, they aren't there.  The only reason Netscape
 works is because it listens to the meta refresh tag that sends it to
 "http://www.mythicalrealms.com/store/index.html".  That is a problem with
 your HTML.  Fix the problem with your HTML.  I don't know how many more
 ways I can say that.  
 
 On top of that, you have two different IP addresses listed for
 www.mythicalrealms.com with two completely different sets of content.  Of
 course you will see odd things if you do that.
 
 I can not reproduce any errors on any of the other sites you are listing.
 What is supposedly wrong with them?

   Well Marc, ThankYou Very Much.......For Being persistent
 I check my uplinks dns entries and found a few problems and got the server responding just
 fine
 with the exeception of two virtual domains and you stated that there was probably a html
 problem.
 I told you I havent changed any of the html for a long time....But I took your Advice and
 double checked the html and couldnt find anything wrong but as soon as i saved the html again
 with
 netscape's composer everything worked great...
 So I say to you Thankyou for being Persistent. in your judgement..I think what was wrong was
 that
 MSIE was looking at the html date and it didnt change so it was still giveing the wrong html
 document and from a time when i didnt have the server setup correctly yet.
 
 Thanks Again,
                          Patman
