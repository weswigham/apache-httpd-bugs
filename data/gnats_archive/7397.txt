>Description:
If httpd is made setuid root (which makes things easier to test) with
apache 1.3.19 it fails to start with the message:
  accept_mutex_on: permission denied
showing up over and over in the logs.

The problem is at line 766 of http_main.c:
  if (!getuid()) {
    .. set ownership on semaphore to ap_user_id
  }

Since httpd is running with euid == 0 and uid != 0
the block of code which sets the ownership on the
semaphore is skipped.  The if code should be checking
for geteuid() != 0, or perhaps even better it should
be checking for getuid() != ap_user_id.

This problem only cropped up in 1.3.19 since semaphores
are now the default on linux 2.2.x, whereas in early
versions of apache that used fcntl there was no issue.

>How-To-Repeat:
1) Build apache
2) chown root ${install-dir}/bin/httpd
3) chmod u+s ${install-dir}/bin/httpd
4) ${install-dir}/bin/apachectl start

Yes, see full description.
