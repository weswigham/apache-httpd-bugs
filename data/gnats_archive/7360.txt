>Environment:
I found the bug in the code, not by running the program.
>Description:
Lines 555 - 564 in org/apache/java/lang/AdaptiveClassLoader chops of the leading #start# characters from the beginning of an invalid class file name such as "../MyClass.class" - which means for the preceding example you would get "yClass.class". It ought to chop off the leading #start - 1# characters.
>How-To-Repeat:
Feed "../MyClass.class" to AdaptiveClassLoader.loadClassFromDirectory()
>Fix:
Change line 562 to:

classFileName = classFileName.substring(start - 1);
