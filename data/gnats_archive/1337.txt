You have a "critical" problem that you can't read the docs?

We are not here to answer configuration questions
(especially trivial ones!).  Please read the documentation.
http://www.apache.org/

If you really have trouble reading, then do as suggested
and post to the comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
newsgroup.
