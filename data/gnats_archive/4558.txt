>Description:


This isn't a bug report, only a suggestion (I didnt find a more appropriate 
place to send this. When a wab page is served up, the host receiving it clicks
on one (or more) of the links. If that host has (recently) previously used this
same page, it *might* be in his/her local cache. But since the internet is a 
place of exploration, odds are that it isn't. This causes the browser (ftp etc)
to generate a DNS request that say generates two or three more before being 
finally resolved. This same page is served up many times per day to different
hosts. This means that this ONE page possibly generates several hundred DNS 
requests per day.... times the number of pages on this ONE server..... times
the number of servers out there... With the number of DNS requests out there
(unnessecarily) consuming bandwidth, wouldn't it make more sense for the web
server to substiture the ip number for the url's in the pages that it serves
up? This would significantly reduce the number of DNS requests generated by
browsers. If the page server got the IP number from its own lookup (either
from its local cache or from the internet) that would also (slightly) speed
up the browsers requests in addition to the savings in additional bandwidth..
The url could still be sent to the browser (as a comment in the HTML or such).
This would allow the browser to have control over doing the DNS lookups if it
wanted to (or needed to ie. bookmarks etc.). It seems to me that this would be
a relatively easy change to the page server and an imense benefit to all on the
internet. (Also alieve aome of the demand on the root name servers)... 

Just the oppinion of one Limux admin...

State-Changed-Why:
No, it does not make any sense.  Not only would it look silly
and break bookmarking, etc. when the IP changes (after all, there
is a reason for using DNS...) but it would decrease the load
on the net as a whole very little because DNS requests are
cached in a very distributed fashion.
