>Organization:
>Environment:
Linux 2.2.14-5.0
>Description:
With a new installation of Redhat Linux, the apache server was working fine within my network. Suddenly, after I was configuring around in LinuxConf, a Forbidden message was displayed in my browsers and the error-log gave:
client denied by server configuration: /path/to/html
>How-To-Repeat:
After installation the httpd.conf file is proparly configured. While I changing my basic configuration in Linux, I must have activate <Files ~> in httpd.conf file. By now I don't know what it does, but it sure gave me a head edge.
>Fix:
Comment out or delete the <Files ~>-section, wich leaves only the <Files />-section.
