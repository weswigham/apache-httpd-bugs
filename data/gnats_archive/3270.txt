State-Changed-Why:
This bug has been submitted before, and has been answered before.
The problem is caused by a bug in the AIX compiler, and we are
currently working with the compiler team to resolve it.  In the
mean-time, using gcc on AIX will not cause the error.  There are
other interim solutions provided in the previous bug reports, and
when the final solution is found, those bug reports will be update.

Please follow the bug on PR 2312
