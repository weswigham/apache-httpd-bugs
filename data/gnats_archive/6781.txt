>Description:

   Problem with the "-f /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf"  option.  The "-f" option does not override the complile time default for the configuration file.  See the section below "suggested way to fix it" for a full description of my problem.

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
  Once, you know what going on then it's easy to work around but because the default (compiled in configuration name) existed I was having a lot of difficulty getting a server to resond.  The Documentation says " The location of this file is set at compile-time, but may be overridden with the -f command line flag."  ...

   Well it appears that version 1.3.12 (Unix) (Red Hat/Linux) that the above statement is not true.  

   When using the -f option I move the default file (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf) to differnet name and the httpd program reported an error while tring to open the complied in configuration file name.


    Thanks
            Tim

State-Changed-Why:

I can't reproduce this problem.  You do realize that
the command line options apply to the httpd binary
and not to apachectl or whatever startup script that
Redhat provides, right?  Could you provide more
details about exactly what you are typing, and what
the effect is?
