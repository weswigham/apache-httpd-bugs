>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Redhat 7.1 with kernel upgraded to 2.4.14
>Description:
Vorbis OGG files are not recognised or given the correct MIME type by default .

Instead, enabling the mime_magic_module and adding the following to the magic file corrects the problem.

0 string    OggS    audio/x-ogg   
>How-To-Repeat:
Try downloading an ogg file from a default Apache install.  The browser will probably mess up the way in which it tries to render the file since the reported mime type will be text/plain.
>Fix:
Many other file types are recognised by default - it should be simple to add ogg to the list.

 I would like to see the default conf/mime.types modified to support Ogg
 out of the box.  
 
 The correct mime type is application/x-ogg (paperwork for registering
 application/ogg is in progress).
 
 Please use the correct mimetype, not audio/x-ogg.

 Yes - we all would.

 Do I guess that apache have to wait until the mime type is decided - then it
 will probably be supported!
 
 > Please use the correct mimetype, not audio/x-ogg.
 
 Sorry for trying :(
