>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, gcc 2.7.2.2
>Description:
Configure automatically detects the libdb.a is needed for mod_auth_db.  But
if you tell configure to make mod_auth_db as a shared module, it does not put
-ldb on the line that links mod_auth_db into a shared object.  When you load
the module, you get "dbopen: referenced symbol not found"

Also, for Sparc V8 chips, there are no 64 bit arithmetic opcodes, so gcc
uses library routines for these.  Since shared objects are linked via ld,
this library is not linked so at load time you get "_moddi3: referenced symbol
not found"
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Former, not sure.
Latter, let gcc invoke ld instead of doing it directly.

 The problem still exists in Apache 1.3.6.  I'm not sure what the comment
 about "no response from submitter" is about, this is the first time I've
 heard anything about this problem since I initially reported it.
