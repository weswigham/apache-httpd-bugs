>Description:
This is a suggestion.  I was thinking that certain modules of
APACHE can be implemented as real-time modules.  RT-Linux do provide
certain support for low-level hard real-time support.  This might
speed up APACHE.  Of course, running something in real-time does not neccessarily
make a process runs faster if the process itself is not optimized.

Just want to see what you guys think of that?

Was there a talk on making APACHE a multi-thread application?

I would be happy to contribute!

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... it really doesn't make much sense to say "make Apache
into realtime modules".  It doesn't make much sense to tie
Apache to a single operating system.

There is talk of a lot of things, and a lot of things are
being done, but they are much better discussed on the development
mailing list than in the bugdb...
