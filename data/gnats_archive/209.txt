>Environment:
Pre compiled binaries for Solarisx86
>Description:
It appears that you get the retry option immeadiately after a user/password
authentication failure.  In our system where the users actual password is used
in this this file, this immeadiate retry leaves the system open to multiple retry
of password attach, possiable automationed via Java/C etc in the client.

>How-To-Repeat:
Try it on Netscape V3.0 Gold
>Fix:
Can you please put a 5 sec delay before returning a failed response to the web
browser

State-Changed-When: Sun Mar 30 06:29:33 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
I will bring this up for discussion, but I expect
that the general feeling will be that imposing an
arbitrary delay is neither friendly nor correct.
Using the system passwd file as a Web authentication
source is generally considered a very bad idea.

State-Changed-Why:
Penalising those who accidentally misspell one of their
authentication fields as a side-effect of adding a
governor to thwart password attacks is not viewed as an
acceptable cost.  Thank you for your suggestion, though,
and for using Apache!
