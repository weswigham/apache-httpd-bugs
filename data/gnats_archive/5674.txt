>Environment:
NT4.0, SP4, jdk1.2.2, jsdk2.0, jserv1.1b3
>Description:
Once a servlet is loaded in by JServ, that servlet remains there even though that servlet has been changed and compiled successfully.  How come JServ does not detect that the servlet has been updated to reload the servlet with the changes?

How to submit the changes to JServ without killing the servers?
