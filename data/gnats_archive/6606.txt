Hi

- I compiled apache 1.3.12 with "--enabled-shared=max", all other things are standard
- I played around with "apxs -g -n foo"

Now the funny thing:

If I recompile the mod_foo and install it again into the libexec directory, then
apache will crash (SIGSEV) when giving him a SIGHUP.

Stopping/Starting apache will work, but restarting crashes.

I think the sigsev occurs when unmapping the memory of the modified mod_foo.


Normal case: (restarting apache but mod_foo not modified:)

wait4(13513, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], WNOHANG, NULL) = 13513
wait4(13514, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], WNOHANG, NULL) = 13514
wait4(13515, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], WNOHANG, NULL) = 13515
wait4(13516, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], WNOHANG, NULL) = 13516
wait4(13517, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], WNOHANG, NULL) = 13517
time(NULL)                              = 970285324
write(15, "[Sat Sep 30 05:42:04 2000] [noti"..., 76) = 76
time(NULL)                              = 970285324
close(18)                               = 0
close(17)                               = 0
munmap(0x401a3000, 6384)                = 0   <-- THIS IS MOD_FOO
munmap(0x401a0000, 9712)                = 0
.
.
.


SIGSEV case: (recompiling mod_foo (without changing the source!!!),
then restarting apache)

wait4(13664, [WIFSIGNALED(s) && WTERMSIG(s) == SIGSEGV], WNOHANG, NULL) = 13664

close(17)                               = 0
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
chdir("/usr/local/www")                 = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGSEGV, {SIG_DFL}, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0
getpid()                                = 13512
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---    


I couldn't find anything about this issue in the dso documents.

Thanks, Christian
