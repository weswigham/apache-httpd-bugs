When I start Apache :

Cannot load C:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE/modules/ApacheModuleProxy.dll into serve

State-Changed-Why:
mod_proxy is there just fine.  However, for some unknown
reason, it does not load on Win95.  It works on 98 and NT
just fine.

There are already numerous PRs about this and it is a known
problem that isn't likely to get fixed until someone who
understands 95's brokenness fixes it.
