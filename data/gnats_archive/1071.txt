Regarding this bug report that I filed almost a month ago, I have good news.
It's not a bug in Apache. It was a configuration problem with our chroot()'ed
Web environment. It seems Digital changed the system administration issues
relating to timezone in OSF/1 4.0, and our sys admins didn't pick up on it
and failed to propagate the changes to the chroot()'ed area. Sorry about the
unnecessary bug report. Please close this PR. Thanks.
