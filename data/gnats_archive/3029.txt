>Description:
Greetings,

I have a server which serves several Name-Based Virtual hosts, on
several ports.  Behavior on the 'main' port (80) is fine.  However, 
all accesses to the other 'Listen' ports go to the first VirtualHost listed 
with that port.  The name of the host appears to be ignored.

Following is the VirtualHosts section of my configuration.  Following 
is where the server actually takes me.

# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, in addition to the default. See also the VirtualHost command

# Pub server
Listen 80
# Tst server
Listen 1234
# Dev server 
Listen 9876

#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

# VirtualHost: Allows the daemon to respond to requests for more than one
# server address, if your server machine is configured to accept IP packets
# for multiple addresses. This can be accomplished with the ifconfig 
# alias flag, or through kernel patches like VIF.

# Any httpd.conf or srm.conf directive may go into a VirtualHost command.
# See also the BindAddress entry.

When I access the following sites, I go to the correct locations:
http://dd.stanford.edu/
http://csb.stanford.edu/
http://lw1.stanford.edu/
http://presage.stanford.edu/
http://presage.stanford.edu:1234/
http://presage.stanford.edu:9876/

I would expect (because of the _default_:*) entry, that 
http://csb.stanford.edu:1234/ would take me to ...default/pub

Further, I would expect that
http://lw1.stanford.edu:1234/ (which has an explicit VirtualHost entry)
would also take me to ...default/pub

However, in both cases, I am taken to ...presage/tst.
Indeed, access to ANY server name on port 1234 takes me to ..presage/tst
    and access to ANY server name on port 9876 takes me to ..presage/dev

Further, I have discovered that the location I am taken to for *:1234 and *:9876
is dependent upon the orderng of entries in httpd.conf  If I move the
VirtualHost for lw1.stanford.edu, Port 1234 to the top of the file, then
*:1234 (including presage.stanford.edu:1234) takes me to default/pub

 Your problem with a _default_ VirtualHost is documented.
 From http://idli.raleigh.ibm.com/manual/vhosts/examples.html#default
 
 "Using such a default vhost with a wildcard port effectively prevents
 any request going to the main server.  A default vhost never serves a
 request that was sent to an address/port that is used for name-based
 vhosts.  If the request contained an unknown or no Host: header it is
 always served from the primary name-based vhost (the vhost for that
 address/port appearing first in the configuration file)."

 I tried to build a similar configuration to yours on my Linux box. I
 couldn't recreate this problem. And your server seems to be down at
 the moment so I can't test it. Please retry and confirm this bug with
 1.3.2 if possible.
 
 Also try replacing your NameVirtualHost entry with:
 
 NameVirtualHost 171.65.16.192:80
 NameVirtualHost 171.65.16.192:1234
 NameVirtualHost 171.65.16.192:9876
 
 and see if your problem goes away.

 Stupid mistake. See:
 http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/examples.html#default
 instead.
