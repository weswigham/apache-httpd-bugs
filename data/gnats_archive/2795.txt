>Description:
Current sample config files allow clients to get a .htaccess file, but I think
it is not good.

I suggest to add following setting to conf/access.conf-dist:

<Files .htaccess>
deny from all
</Files>

State-Changed-Why:
Good point.  The default template configuration files (*.dist*)
have been modified to protect .htaccess by default.  This
change should appear in the next release after 1.3.1.
Thanks for reporting this and for using Apache!
