>Environment:
Redhat 5.0, GDBM 1.7.3, Perl v5.004, Linux 2.0.34
>Description:
using dbmmanage generates a file without the .db extension.

When presented with a file with a .db extension, it will not view
the contents.

renaming the file to 'sitepasswd.db' allows it to be accessed by
mod_auth_dbm.
>How-To-Repeat:
dbmmanage sitepasswd adduser mmclagan  <<-- generates 'sitepasswd'
AuthDBMUserFile sitepasswd  <<-- in .htaccess

access something in the directory
>Fix:
modify the perl file so that it uses the extension if given?  rename
the output file to accomodate the missing .db ?

State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly due to using different *db*
libraries in perl and Apache.

If you try modifying the order of the:

#                               -ldb    -lndbm    -lgdbm
BEGIN { @AnyDBM_File::ISA = qw(DB_File NDBM_File GDBM_File) }

line to have what you compiled Apache with first, does that
make it work better?
