>Description:
When trying to create a new LogFormat, such as the following:

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%m %U %H\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" my_log_format

Apache doesn't recognize both %m and %H, this is the output of apachectl configtest:

Syntax error on line 474 of /www/etc/httpd.conf:
Unrecognized LogFormat directive %m

Also, it produces an error on %H when %m is deleted (to see if %H is also unknown) as the following:

Syntax error on line 474 of /www/etc/httpd.conf:
Unrecognized LogFormat directive %H
>How-To-Repeat:
Insert the following line near the line that defines the "combined" LogFormat:

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%m %U %H\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" my_log_format

Then, do:

apachectl configtest

OR

apachectl restart
>Fix:
No, I didn't look at the source code of Apache, yet.

That is correct, 1.3.9 does not support that.  1.3.10 will.

 Hello Marc,
 
 Do you have an estimate when 1.3.10 is going to be released?
