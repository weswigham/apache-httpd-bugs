>Environment:
SCO OpenServer 5.0.0 and 5.0.2
>Description:
Under SCO OpenServer 5.0.0 and 5.0.2, using fcntl() to lock a pipe is illegal.

This results in an error 22 (EINVAL) when mod_rewrite tries to lock the pipe when fd_lock() is called from lookup_map_program() (which uses unnamed pipes to the lookup process).

When this occurs, the lock isn't created, and the child process of Apache immediately terminates, which causes a host of client errors (conenction unexpectdly terminated, unknown response, etc.)

This bug is documented at SCO's website:

http://www5.sco.com/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=0518327359+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve
>How-To-Repeat:
Get a SCO 5.0.0 or 5.0.2 box, create a simple shell script to perform some task of a rewrite operation, and watch it provide you with various client errors.

(I've fixed my servers, but I can break one if you want a demonstration.)
>Fix:
If you're running SCO ODT 5.0.0 or 5.0.2, simply add this to mod_rewrite.h
(I guess SCO is as braindead as Sun sometimes... <g>)

 [Matthew Emmerton]
 Still a problem in the 1.2.4 release as well as the 1.3b3.
 
 Note that this problem is caused by a bug in the OS (SCO OpenServer 5.0.0 
 and 5.0.2 ONLY), thus Apache really isn't at fault.  However, mod_rewrite 
 should handle errors on locking a bit more gracefully.
 
 Or just disable it for all SCO version just like you did for the 
 "braindead" SUNOS4 platforms and sacrifice a bit of stability.
