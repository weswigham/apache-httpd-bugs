>Description:
I look all over for a webmaster to handle this problem, but could not find one.
Following links to 
http://httpd.apache.org/dist/binaries/win32/
produces the directory containing Apache 1.3.19 window binaries and sources. 
Clicking on any link in this directory produces NOT FOUND ERROR??

Can you have this fixed??
