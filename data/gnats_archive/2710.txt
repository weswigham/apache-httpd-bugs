>Description:
configure breaks if you have more than one domain name listed in your 
/etc/resolv.conf in a 'search' directive.  IMHO, this isnt the right
way to do this at all- what guarantee is there that they have a resolv.conf
and that they have only a single domain name listed in the 'search' statement?
>How-To-Repeat:
in /etc/resolv.conf:
search foo.domain.com
search bar.otherdomain.com

then ./configure normally in the apache source directory
>Fix:
figure out a smarter way of getting the domain name (duh.) perhaps check to see if
there is more than one domain listed in the /etc/resolv.conf, and if so prompt the
user for the correct domain name, using the first one found as the default value.


The configure script looks incredibly broken. example:
            domainname="`egrep '^[      ]*search' /etc/resolv.conf |\
                         sed -e 's/.*search//' -e 's/^[         ]*//' \
                             -e 's/^ *//' -e 's/^       *//' \
                             -e 's/ .*//' -e 's/^\.//' -e 's/^/./'`"

ugly!!!! thats the most heinous sed script i've ever seen! it can be reduced to 
this:

domainname="`awk  '/search/ { print "."$2 }' /etc/resolv.conf`

someone needs to rewrite this configure. its terrible.

 slight correction to the awk script:
 
 
  awk  '/search/ { print /^./ ? $2 : "."$2 }' /etc/resolv.conf

 A few statements:
 
 1. The configure is not such terrible because we like it this way.
    Its mostly such terrible to be portable. If the goal would be less
    complicated constructs we would write it in Icon or Perl or whatever
    powerful language. But we only have Bourne-Shell and a few
    semi-standardized tools we can use in a portable way. So just saying "some
    needs to rewrite this configure. its terrible" is not very realistic.  At
    least not when you are confronted with such a lot of platforms which such a
    lot of broken tools.
 
 2. Yes, the sed used construct is horrible. But its maximum portable 
    this way (even if there is a bug with the two search entries). Replacing it
    with your suggested Awk-based solution is perhaps possible. But you will
    not doubt me when I say that the chance is high that this one fails under
    some platforms. Awks are even more broken out there in the world then some
    Sed's, really.
 
 3. When you think about the problematic of determining the domainname
    of a machine _IN A PORTABLE WAY_ you recognize that trying to guess it from
    some information inside /etc/resolv.conf is the only acceptable way. Sure,
    its not the correct way on some platforms, but all other ways like
    nslookup-based approaches, uname-based approaches or even checking
    /etc/hosts is either non-portable or results in even more incorrect values.
 
 But you're right, we missed at least the fact that perhaps there are more than
 one "search" entry in /etc/resolv.conf. This is a bug. Thanks discovering
 this. But IMHO the best and most portable way is to just add a "head -1" after
 the egrep. 
 
 BTW, even you suggested 
    
    domainname="`awk '/search/ { print /^./ ? $2 : "."$2 }'`"
 
 as a better solution you also forgot the "multiple-search" problem: It fails
 also when more "search" entries exist! It just prints all of them. And
 additionally it is non-portable because it uses nested double quotes which
 some braindead Bourne Shell variants dislike most.
 
 So, please understand that we only add "head -1" for Apache 1.3.2 and have to
 ignore your suggestion because of portability. Nevertheless thanks for the
 report.

Close this report. We fixed it now for Apache 1.3.2

 all good points, and i understand now why the configure is how it is.

 I realized that it would do exactly the same thing; i wasnt trying to get
 it to return just the first one.

 IMHO in the future, it would be better to ask the user for a default
 domain name if more than one is found in /etc/resolv.conf.  There isnt any
 fast and true policy that says people will put their real domain as the
 first entry (or at all!)  
 
 In this respect, configure needs to be smarter, and if it gets more than
 one entry, to grab the first one and say "is your domain name foo.com? if
 not, enter it here:"  Although i know this is quite different from what
 the configure does now, blindly assuming that the 'head -1' will assure
 you get the real domain name doesnt sound like a good solution to me. 
 
 
 Ironically- since by default configure is silent, I would have never known
 until apache was compiled that it picked the wrong domain name, if that
 bug hadnt been there.
