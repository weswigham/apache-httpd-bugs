Hi ,

I have developed own apache module for security and authorization system. I am using Entrust Proxy Server to secure our apache web server. I need to access HTTP environment varibale using Apache API.

How can I access HTTP Environment  Variable using  Apache API?Which Apache API function require to find out the value of HTTP Environment varibale like HTTP_COOKIE , HTTP_ACCEPT, QUERY_STRING, REMOTE_ADDR, PATH, REQUEST_URI, SERVER_ADDR, etc..

I have also own HTTP Environment Varibale called HTTP_ENTRUST_CLIENT.How can I get the value of that variable.?
I want to use Apache API. Is there any change require in httpd configuration file?

I am looking for early reply.

Regards
Prasanta

 Yes you do. Apache doesn't use the usual environment mechanisms
 internally. Please don't answer bug reports with incorrect
 information.

 Look at mod_include.c for an example: You set up the contents of the
 environment table like this:
 
         ap_add_common_vars(r);
         ap_add_cgi_vars(r);
 
 Then you look up the value like this:
 
         val = ap_table_get(r->subprocess_env, var);

 However, when using the C API most of this information can be accessed
 more efficiently by pulling it out of the request_rec. The HTTP_
 variables come from the headers table, e.g.
 
         ap_table_get(r->headers_in, "Host");
 
 and the parts of the URI is accessible from various elements like
 r->args (corresponding to QUERY_STRING).
 
 Look at the source for ap_add_common_vars and ap_add_cgi_vars for
 further examples of the C API equivalents to the CGI environment
 variables.
 
 Tony.
