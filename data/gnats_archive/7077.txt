This is no new bug report, it's only a sugestion:

Byteserving for Netscape 4.x / IE4 / IE 5  with Adobe Acrobat 4.x plugin,
the Acrobat plugin crashes if background loading of pdf document is enabled and 
if the document is viewn inside the browser.

>Fix:
This is no new bug report, it's only a sugestion:

Byteserving for Netscape 4.x / IE4 / IE 5  with Adobe Acrobat 4.x plugin,
there is a patch available from Tony Finch.
several bug reports speak about it ( 6761 for example ).
Would it not be better to provide a page in the documentation that speaks about 
byteserving ? The problem described in the bug reports is caused by Acrobat reader
that from version 4 loads only the bytes needed to represent the current viewn
page. Some lines about it and about the browser configuration as well could 
save a lot of time to people using apache with pdf's.
I would also volunteer to write such a page.
cheers
