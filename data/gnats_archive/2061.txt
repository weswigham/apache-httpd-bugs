State-Changed-When: Mon Nov  9 05:52:37 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
So true.  strftime on Windows does not support all of 
the time formats.  Manoj has manually coded implementations
for these missing time formats.  The fix is in CVS and
should be available in the next release.

Thanks for using Apache.
