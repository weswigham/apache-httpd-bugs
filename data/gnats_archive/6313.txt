If child Apache process dies it is restarted by Apache. During this process JServ JVM is being killed, but new JVM is not created.
>How-To-Repeat:
Kill one of two apache processes (child one). It will be created again, but JVM not.
>Fix:
Add "ReleaseSemaphore(wrapper_semaphore, 1, NULL);" at the end of thread function. This will allow recreation of JVM.
