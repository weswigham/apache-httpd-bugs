>Description:
We discovered this bug because on of our server suffered a power failure.

When power was restored and the system came back up the apachectl script
which we had linked into the system startup scripts directory (/etc/rc2.d)
failed to start apache and complained it was already running.

On investigatation it turned out that the httpd.pid had not been removed
because the system hadn't been shut down cleanly and the kill -0 test in
apachectl concluded that apache was still running because another process
(not apache) had been started with the same PID as the one listed in the
httpd.conf file.
>How-To-Repeat:
It is very difficult to re-produce live, but there is a test setup that will
demonstate the problem: Stop apache then re-create the httpd.pid file with
the PID of the current shell (echo $$ > httpd.pid).  This simulates the situation
when our system came back up.  Now run apachectl start and it will claim that
httpd is already running though it isn't.
>Fix:
Here's one possibility.  This may need to be checked for portability to
the various unix flavours due to different options to the 'ps' command.
