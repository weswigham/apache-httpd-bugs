SunOS 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
using gcc 2.7.2.3
>Description:
When I "make" apache 1.3b on Solaris 2.6, it dies on the PTHREAD foo in src/main/http_main.c
If I comment this out, it compiles and works fine.  
Below is the output from make:

 Did you perhaps build gcc under solaris 2.5.1 or 2.5 before upgrading to
 2.6?

 Nope.  It was grabbed from http://www.sunfreeware.com/solaris_2.6.html
 and installed via pkgadd.

 Could you check the man pages then and see if there's some extra #include
 that's needed under 2.6?  That code works fine under 2.5 and 2.5.1. 
 Perhaps you could also ask in a solaris newsgroup.

State-Changed-Why:
It turns out that this is a problem with the pre-built binaries
found at www.sunfreeware.com.  I've submitted a note to the
fellow that maintains that site.  Two solutions:

- build gcc from scratch (a good idea)

- Set EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include -D__EXTENSIONS__
in src/Configuration and give it another try.
