 How exactly are you trying to configure it?
 
 What exactly did you change in the configuration files?
 
 Is there anything in the error log?

The error log says exactly what the problem is:

[Sun Nov 08 09:49:27 1998] [error] Invalid path in os_stat: "/Program Files/Apa
che/proxy/.time", should have a drive letter or be a UNC path

You need a drive letter on that path.  ie. "c:/Program Files/Apache/proxy",
and on all your other paths.  This should have been done by the install
program.
