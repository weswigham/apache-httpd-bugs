>Description:
Suggestion:  it would be nice to have a setup GUI interface much like what
Netscape provides with its line of servers.  Particularly, I think users will
find using a GUI much easier, especially if it can handle the access.conf and
related configuration constructs.  Is this doable or perhaps already in the 
works?

State-Changed-Why:
You are not alone in wanting this.  There is a Majordomo
mailing list for discussing this: <GUI-Dev@Apache.Org>.
Send a message to <gui-dev-request@apache.org> with the
word HELP in the body (*not* the subject!) of the message
if you're not familiar with Majordomo mailing lists.
Thanks for your suggestion, and for using Apache!
