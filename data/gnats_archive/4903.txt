 Check your error log, it propably says 'Unexpected end of headers' or
 something along those lines. Very old (dare I say pre-cgi) app's would not
 sent the compulsory header line 'Content-type: text/html\n\n'.

 Dear Dirk,
 
 I am sending you a complementary information.
 
 This is the '/var/log/httpd/error_log' message :
 [Tue Aug 31 18:03:10 1999] [error] [client 194.235.30.1] malformed header from script. Bad header=Cannot associate a name with u: /home/httpd/cgi-bin/gform
 
 
 But, I normally received the 'Email' with the associated information introduced in the web page. More, I recieved a file in the directory /tmp/manuel like I
 requested in the web page that call the 'gform'.
 
 It means, the gform run, thera is not any problems concerning the 'mail', the only problem is the message that we get when I click on the 'send' button.
 
 That is why I thing that the problem is related with the configs files of APACHE. What are the news parameters that can affect the named programme 'gform' writed in
 
 'C'  ?
 
 I repeat, 'gform' run under NCSA httpd v1.4 and under APACHE 1.x.x does not run anymore.
 
 Thanks a lot for your help.

 This most certainly looks like a header problem with your CGI; check the
 FAQ or any CGI programming information.
 
 Or, just add at the very, very top of you program the line
 
 	printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");
 
 This will make sure that the script is CGI/1.1 compliant and works
 (again) with apache. More recent versions of apache are indeed more strict
 on those things.
 
 Secondly, it looks like:

 > 1999] [error] [client 194.235.30.1] malformed header from script. Bad
 > header=Cannot associate a name with u: /home/httpd/cgi-bin/gform
 
 that your CGI outputs an error mesage on CGI;
 
 	'Cannot associate a name with u: /home/httpd/cgi-bin/gform'
 
 Which could be anything. But we are no longer discussing an apache bug
 here; or an apache problem. 
 
 I consider this as a CGI programming problem on your end; it really seems
 that your script is not CGI compliant; and earlier versions of the
 software let you get away with it. But no more. So I am clsing this.

This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the

Please ask your question there.
