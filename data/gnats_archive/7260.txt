>Organization:
>Environment:
WinNT 4.0 SP6.0a
>Description:
RewriteMap does not appear to be working at all for the latest release of WinNT/Apache.  We have downloaded the latest binaries from the Apache web site and have the latest service packs installed.  Even the simpliest of RewriteMap  examples do not work.  This is similar to PR# 6422, but this is a much simplier case.  The release notes for Apache 1.3.17 mention a change to rewrite map, but it appears these changes haven't been installed in the binaries on the apache web site.

Here is an excerpt of the release notes... 
The bug fixes are:
* Restore functionality broken by the mod_rewrite security fix:
  rewrite map lookup keys and default values are now expanded
  so that the lookup can depend on the requested URI etc.     
>How-To-Repeat:
RewriteEngine on
# This next line works
#RewriteRule   ^(.*)$             http://www.netscape.com       [L] 
# These lines don't perform  a lookup
RewriteMap redirect               txt:C:/Temp/redirect.txt
RewriteRule   ^(.*)$              ${redirect:$1|http://www.verizon.com}   [L]
