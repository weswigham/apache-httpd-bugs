>Description:
Error 400, Bad Request is given every time I have tried to connect to a virtual
host using an underscore(_) in its hostname.  I tried several controls, including
different hostnames, document roots and IP's, all with the same result. Any virtual
host with a "_" in the name (ex. test_serv.qx.net) gave 400 error, regardless of
any other changes I made. hope this helps:) Thanks.

 With the same environment its working fine for us. It
 is not a problem in Apache...try to match your
 /etc/hosts file and httpd.conf entries with the
 following ours. 
 
 "hosts" file entries are:
 127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain
 172.16.1.101 chs_a.kovaiteam.com  chs
 
 "httpd.conf" entries are:
 
 .....
 .....
 NameVirtaulHost 172.16.1.101
 <VirtualHost chs_a.kovaiteam.com>
 Server name chs.kovaiteam.com
 DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin
 </VirtualHost>
 .....
