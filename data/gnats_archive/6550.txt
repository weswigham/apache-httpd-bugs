>Description:
Terse version:  mod_log_config in 2.0a6 doesn't flush buffered log entries
upon server termination or -- if applicable -- child process exit.

For the verbose version see my message to new-httpd on Sep. 13:
Message-Id: <200009131852.LAA35105@trudge.engr.sgi.com>
and the response(s) to it, and also
Message-Id: <200009142151.OAA40159@trudge.engr.sgi.com>
>How-To-Repeat:
Compile with BUFFERED_LOGS defined and watch the access log be too short
after terminating the server or a child process.
>Fix:
The verbose version suggests several ways to fix this problem.  It seems
that the design and use of the log pool (called plog) is incomplete.
I suggest that plog should be a child of the child pool pchild but I
don't see how to do that cleanly without changing some fundamental APIs
(such as the pre- and post-config hooks and ap_mpm_run()) or else that
MPMs must apr_clear_pool(plog) in the appropriate places but that seems
contrary to the lifetime of plog as described in main().

 >Fix:
 One new solution that works is for mod_log_config to register a
 child_init hook which registers a cleanup to call flush_all_logs() on
 its pchild argument.  This is only half the solution, however.  The
 other half is to change init_config_log() to use the config pool for
 everything rather than the log pool (I simply renamed its second
 argument from p to pl and its first from pc to p).  This leaves the log
 pool entirely unused throughout Apache/2.0 though so it just can't be
 right, although it works as far as I've tested it.

State-Changed-Why:
This has been fixed in CVS.  We need to have a child_init
phase, which just registers a cleanup iff BUFFERED_LOGS is
on.  plog was not designed for use with child processes.  The
purpose behind plog, is to allow logging to continue to work
when the config file is re-read.  See PR 4456 for a description
of why this pool was originally added.
