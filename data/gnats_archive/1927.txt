>How-To-Repeat:
I cannot tell any URLs for security reasons, but just include SSLeay into
apache 1.2.5, configure no default server, just create one virtual server
for https and another one (second IP) without https. If you ask for the second
domain using https you should get access to the install path. If you have
problems repeating this problems, I can set up a server and give you access
through my firewall.
>Fix:
Just update the install procedure to include an index.html file with some
text saying "Go away" into the installation path

State-Changed-Why:
First, we have nothing to do with the SSL patches so we can not
do anything about them.  Can you reproduce this problem without
them?

What path are you talking about?  ie. what define in 
httpd.h is set to it?  What is your DocumentRoot
set to in your main server config?  ie. not any virtualhost.

Exactly what you are saying is the problem isn't really
clear.  I don't see how adding an index.html file would
help anything if what you explain is correct; then all they
have to do is guess the name of what they want, which isn't
too hard.

 The point is, that you need the https support to drop to an unwanted
 http server which is not configured. I do not know how the module
 stuff exactly works, but I think the SSL module fails to check if
 the mentioned problem occurs. On the other hand there could be a
 reason to check for unconfigured URLs in the apache code to get
 on the safe side concerning new modules.
 
 I will send information on this problem to the SSL guy. So you will
 not loose any time in implementing new code and tracking more important
 problems.

 I had my DocumentRoot set to the installpath of apache. After
 recompiling the code it points to a location where nobody can
 get any files and only gets a short go-away message. To set
 it to the point where the virtual servers stuff lives would be
 no good idea.

 You're right, there were too many things I had to handle at once
 in that moment. Especially that guy who told us that he "attacked"
 us successfully was not a nice one. I had to find a quick solution
 to block him from accessing more files. I don't think that he got
 the interesting non-standard parts of directory/file structure.

 Well, that is the problem then.  You set the DocumentRoot explicitly to
 tell the server to serve files from that directory.  If the request
 doesn't match any vhost, it uses the main DocumentRoot.  I don't see any
 problems with Apache serving files from where you have told it to serve
 files...

 If you don't want it to do that, add an explicit Listen statement for each
 IP address and port you want to listen on.  Otherwise, the only thing that
 makes sense is for it to serve files for "servers which aren't
 configured".  Think about what happens in the case of not having any
 virtualhosts.  All adding virtualhosts does is add specific host and/or IP
 and/or port combinations to treat differently.

 Hi!
 
 I'm the person who reported the problem with his site to Mr. Heilwagen.
 
 I'm working with a governmental educational facility where one of my tasks 
 is to provide computer security for a close defined user group.
 
 Not at any time, I did 'attack' any site, Mr. Heilwagen is responsible 
 for, nor did I state that I did.
 
 When Mr. Heilwagen tells anyone, I did, he's braking german laws.
 
 My boss and I will have to inform the law enforcement authorites if he 
 continues.
 
 I did take the chance to inform him of the security leak his site 
 explored, because the provided content is authorized gorvernmental
 information.
 
 I do hereby in public ask him to remove his false accusations from this 
 server (bugs.apache.org) or any other server providing this wrong 
 information.

 I learned something about my english :-)
 
 So, the unversity I work with, is better called a 'public educational 
 facility' rather than 'governmental educational facility'.
 
 And with 'provided content' (terminus technicus) I meant the content, the 
 server normally provides, when accessed via http:// not https://.
 
 In my opinion, the provided configuration information is called 
 'meta-information', because, it's just important for the transfer.
