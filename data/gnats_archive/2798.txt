>Release:        1.3.1
>Environment:
AIX (4.3.1)
using the cc compiler provided by the vendor
>Description:
Here is the compilation command and the error messages:
cc -c  -I../../os/unix -I../../include   -DAIX=43 -U__STR__ -qnogenpcomp -qnousepcomp -DAIX_BIND_PROCESSOR -DUSE_HSREGEX `../../apaci` os.c
"os-aix-dso.c", line 133.12: 1506-343 (S) Redeclaration of dlerror differs from previous declaration on line 57 of "/usr/include/dlfcn.h".
"os-aix-dso.c", line 133.12: 1506-050 (I) Return type "const unsigned char*" in redeclaration is not compatible with the previous return type "unsigned char*".
>How-To-Repeat:
Compilation on the same kind of system will do the job
>Fix:
I replaced the line 19 in apache_1.3.1/src/os/unix/os.c by
#if (AIX < 43)
It was ok then
