Using source out of CVS,

ap_config.h defines HAVE_MMAP (on a standard win32 install)

jserv_mmap.c uses this to include sys/mman.h.
>How-To-Repeat:
get source out of CVS
>Fix:
Either find a NT method of implementing this feature, or add && !defined(WIN32)
to the code so that it doesn't use mem mapping...

 might want to try
 +#if defined(HAVE_MMAP) && !defined(WIN32)
 
 
 
 oh... I found another prob in jserv_ajpv12.c it is missing the include file
 http_core.h
 it is needed for ap_get_server_name/ ap_get_server_port
 just #including it seemed to work.
