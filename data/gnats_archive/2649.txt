State-Changed-When: Tue Jul 21 15:03:51 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:

The -Z switch is currently not functional (therefore 
the windows.html page is incomplete). We will 
fixe it in a later version of Apache (maybe 1.3.2).

Currently you can only stop/start Apache when you run it
on NT as a service (use the service manager
or the 'net' command for this purpose).

State-Changed-Why:
The new -k option on Win32 will fix the user's problems.
Please upgrade to 1.3.3 and use the new apache -k shutdown
option to shutdown or apache -k restart to restart
Apache.
Thanks for using Apache
