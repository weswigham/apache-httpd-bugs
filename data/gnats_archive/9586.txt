OS: Win2K SP1
Apache install: Binary - Filename: apache_1.3.22-win32-x86.exe 
>Description:
My internet browser (IE 5) is set to use English as first choice of language, Swedish for second.

I installed Apache, started my browser and pointed to localhost - and it worked. Amazing thing was I got the index.html in Swedish when I was expecting English.

When looked at the AddLanguage in the httpd.conf, it said "AddLanguage en .en" - but the settings page in IE 5 appeared to set 'en-gb'.

I changed the AddLanguage to "AddLanguage en-gb .en" and restarted.  Now I got the page in English.

State-Changed-Why:

Apache is doing the right thing here.  It is your browser
that is misconfigured.  See, for example, 
http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/www/lang-neg.html

Apache 2.0 will have a configuration option to deal with
misconfigured browsers, but it will not change the result
in your case.  You are telling apache that you prefer
"British English (en-uk)", then Swedish.  Since you don't request
"General English (en)", you won't get it.
