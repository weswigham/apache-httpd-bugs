Apache.exe - Entry Point Not Found
"The procedure entry point _ap_rwrite@12 could not be located in the dybamic link library ApacheCore .dll."

This is the error message that comes when i try to start Apache. The problem appeared after i installed JRun. Before that Apache would start.
I reinstalled 1.3.9 and 1.3.6 but i still got the same error message.
The problem has been submited in the past (4407), it'e exactly the same case like mine but there hasn't been submitted a solution.

State-Changed-Why:
Since Apache works fine without this third party module, it
is probably some problem with the third party module.  Most
likely, it wasn't compiled for the correct version of Apache.
Your version of Apache needs to exactly match the one it was
compiled for.  You need to contact the vendor of jrun for
a version that matches.
