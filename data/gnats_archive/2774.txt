>Release:        1.3.x
>Environment:
Linux 2.0.34 - gcc
Apache 1.3b5/Apache 1.3.0/Apache 1.3.1
one webserver 1.5 mln hits, second webserver 100,000 hits max.
No access-logging module.
>Description:
The problem was first noticed with Apache 1.3b5, having a configuration where two webservers (not as VirtualHosts - both had their own config)
were listening to port 80 for different IP-addresses. At random times the webserver with the highest number of hits stops accepting lots of requests (some get through, but most don't).
At times this happens the serverload drops, but the problem continues... This situation can last for a few minutes, but it can also last for several hours.
The webserver has been upgraded from 1.3b5 to 1.3.0 and 1.3.1, but the problem still occurs. 
The configuration has been changed so it uses VirtualHost, but the only effect has been that now both webservers become unresponsive at random times.
One webserver has 1.5 million-2 million hits per day, the other only 100,000 max.

MaxClients is not the problem (set to 256, where at the problem times only 40 childs are running).
>How-To-Repeat:
I have not found a way to force the problem to occur, but dropping server priority (nice) seems to increase the problem.
I think the problem has something to do with the fact that the webserver is listening to more than one IP-address/port.

State-Changed-Why:
Are there any messages logged to the error_log?

If it shows an "flock" error, try editting include/ap_config.h
searching for LINUX, then find USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
and change it to USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT... this change
will be the default in 1.3.5.

Comment-Added:
Do you still have this problem with 1.3.6?  We changed
the default locking behaviour on linux back to the 1.2.x
settings.

 The problem was not caused by Apache (and as far as I remember I've been in contact with someone from Apache about this). The problem was caused by insufficient buffering by the Linux kernel. Applying a patch to the (what was then 2.0.35 as the newest Li nux kernel available) kernel sources to increase TCP/IP buffering and max. number of sockets solved the problem.
 
 At the time of reporting Apache 1.3.1 was the newest Apache available, but the problem hasn't occured anymore since the kernel was patched.
