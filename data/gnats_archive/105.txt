>Environment:

>Description:
We are hosting several web servers, of which not all have their name servers
located on one of our hosts. It happened, that on a automatic restart of the 
httpd, the name server of one virtual host was not reachable, causing the
restart to fail.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Please change httpd behaviour, so that it simply skips the virtual host entry
and and records the failure in the error_log, instead of failing to start. I prefer
haveing only n-1 virtual hosts up and runing than none up and runinng
