>Description:
I downloaded the last rpm of mod_auth_shadow, installed it, and when I run
apachectl -configtest, I get:

==snip==========
Syntax error on line 1038 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
API module structure `authshadow_module' in file 
/usr/lib/apache/mod_auth_shadow.so is garbled - 
perhaps this is not an Apache module DSO?
==snap==========
The line in httpd.conf is:

LoadModule authshadow_module  /usr/lib/apache/mod_auth_shadow.so

I did try to build the module from the source, but this fails with a 
compilation error.

Any ideas?

Best regards, and thanks for help,

Harald

We have nothing to do with mod_auth_shadow or any RPMs of it, so we are unable to help.  You have to talk to whoever built the RPM or whoever distributes the module.
