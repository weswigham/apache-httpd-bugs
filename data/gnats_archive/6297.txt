>Description:
The bug appear if someone compile apache with *static 
(not .so modul)* PHP4 and add to PHP4 support for imap.
The imap's lib with name "libc-client" *expect* in the 
sources some functions, but this functions aren't in the
configure's dummy.c; and configure finish with error.

Simple test:

$ gcc src/helpers/dummy.c -o dummy -lc-client

/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_expunged'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_diskerror'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_lsub'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_flags'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_fatal'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_nocritical'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_notify'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_searched'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_status'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_login'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_list'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_critical'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_exists'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_log'
/usr/lib/libc-client.so: undefined reference to `mm_dlog'

>Fix:
Hmm, take some parts of dummy.c from modules (PHP) that
know what will compiled. 

Or better solution... total overwrite apache build system :-)
