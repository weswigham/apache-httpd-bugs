I as all others running Apache under windows gets the error-log flooded by this warning:
[Wed May 20 10:06:34 1998] [warn] (2)No such file or directory: select claimed we could write, but in fact we couldn't. This is a bug in Windows.

Since there is no way to fix it I tried to set LogLevel=Error in httpd.conf. But the warnings still filles the log.

 No, this isn't _all_ people running Apache under Win32.  Only some which,
 for some reason, run into a pathetic Microsoft hack.

 Exactly what directive did you put in your config file?  Did you add a new
 one or change the "LogLevel warn" already in the file?  Are you sure you
 restarted the server afterwards?
 
 Oh, BTW, this will be logged at a debug level in future releases.

 I just changed the existing one from 'LogLevel warn' to 'LogLevel 
 error'.

I restarted the server, but the messages still filled the log. But 
when I updatet to Winsock2 the messages dissapeared. I don't know if 
it's because the update they wanished.

You need to restart the server, either with a USR1 or
a HUP signal, in order for the change to take effect.
Please do this and let us know if you're still getting
the message in your error log.  Also, please check for
any and all occurrences of the LogLevel directive in all
of your server config files.
