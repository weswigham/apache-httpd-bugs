WinNT4 sp6 with VC++7 (beta1)
>Description:
winsock.h is included by windows.h before we include winsock2.h -> fatal compile error. 

Another thing (not a bug): some headers do not have the 
#ifdef  __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

which leads to unresolved external error in C++ - code. Please, put them in!
Ex: mpm_winnt.h 
>How-To-Repeat:
compile service.c in VC++
>Fix:
#ifndef WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#endif

#ifdef  __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
   .........
#ifdef  __cplusplus
}
#endif

State-Changed-Why:

The headers are now included after defining _WINUSER_ to
prevent the minimal parsing of winuser.h that apr defines.

Apps built upon APR are responsible for staying in the very
limited scope of what must be exported (any GUI ick is
excluded), or including APR _after_ including windows.h
in whatever manner it chooses.  You are right about winsock,
Microsoft made it near impossible to sequence these right.

As it turns out, it was simpler to drop APR's early GUI
include and then reenable that header for the games that
service.c actually plays.  It won't for long, these api's
are leaving service.c for Win9xConHook, and then into apr.

Thanks for the report and interest in the new-httpd 2.0
Alpha project!  Please look at http://dev.apache.org for 
information on cvs access if you would like to stay with
the latest and greatest [and oftentimes broken] development
tree from Anonymous CVS.
