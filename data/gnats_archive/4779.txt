>Environment:
Win NT 4.0 US-Version, Servicepack 4 installed
Binary install of Apache 1.3.6
>Description:
I used the following script (I found it in the CGI.pm doc; just added
the local.)

#!d:/programme/perl/bin/perl.exe
use CGI qw/:push -nph/;
local $| = 1;
print multipart_init(-boundary=>'----------------here we go!');
while (1) {
    print multipart_start(-type=>'text/plain'),
      "The current time is ",scalar(localtime),"\n",
        multipart_end;
    sleep 1;
}

When I save this as pushtest.pl my browser just keeps loading and
loading,
but shows nothing. Saved as nph-pushtest.pl it gives me an updated page
from time to time, that definetly looks like buffered output. (Many
consecutive pages are shown in a very short time, then the script seems to 
stop for a while and so on....)
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be repeatable by using the above quoted script on a Windows NT machine.
>Fix:
I´m sorry, but no.
