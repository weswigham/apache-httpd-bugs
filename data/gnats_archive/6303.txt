 Hello,
 
 I saw your note helping somebody else with this problem, but I did not see
 an answer.  Was one found for this?
 --
 
 I am getting the same error message when I try to run apachectl start after
 compiling with
 visualage c 4.0 on AIX 4.3.2.0.  It gave
 errors about alignment of text does not match requied alignment or httpd not
 executable, or cannot run a file that does not have a valid format. I tried
 gcc, but it gets the same errors.
