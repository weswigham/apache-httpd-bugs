>Description:
Its not possible to use a colon (:) in any --prefix directory specified.

At line ~1200 of configure, you're doing a sed substitution for runtimedir_relative 
(and 3 others) using ':' as the deliminator.
>How-To-Repeat:
./configure --prefix=/www:80
>Fix:
Either allow the user to specify the deliminator (probably not worth it for the 
number of people this would hit)or at the very least document it (it took me a 
while to work out why the server wouldn't start)
