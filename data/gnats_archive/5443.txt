Windows 98
>Description:
This works with Linux and AIX Apaches.
When using the '#!' line for a CGI script, with Windows 98 the first line is ALSO
passed to the Script Interpreter.  This is OK for Perl and Csh, etc. where # starts a
comment line.

From the error.log file:


[Wed Dec 08 15:51:56 1999] [error] [client 132.198.110.123] Premature end of scr
ipt headers: c:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/wvwcgi.rex
[Wed Dec 08 15:51:56 1999] [error] [client 132.198.110.123]      1 *-* #

[Wed Dec 08 15:51:56 1999] [error] [client 132.198.110.123] Error 13 running c:\
program files\apache group\apache\cgi-bin\wvwcgi.rex line 1:  Invalid character
in program

[Wed Dec 08 15:51:56 1999] [error] [client 132.198.110.123] Error 13.1:  Incorre
ct character in program "#" ('23'X)



Where wvwcgi.rex is:

#!c:/objrexx/rexx
/*  Magic does NOT work  12/8/99  */
  Say "Content-type: text/html"
  Say ""
  Say "This CGI script works!  Object Rexx";
>How-To-Repeat:
Yes, but the Web client will only show the "Internal Server Error" -- it's the 
error.log file that shows the error.
>Fix:
Windows Apache handling of the '#!' line should bypass that line also.

State-Changed-Why:
Read up on the ScriptInterpreterSource directive. 
You will need to:
1. remove the #! from the script
You say this works on Unix but not Windows. This implys that
the rexx interpreter is not working the same way on Windows,
but nevermind that for now...

2. Create a file association with the .rex extension in the
registry. Your rexx package may have already done that when
it was installed. Basically, you need to tell Windows what
.exe needs to be run against files with type .rex

Let me know if this works for you. If it does, I'll update
the FAQ
