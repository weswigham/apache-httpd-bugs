Linux 2.2.13 (Mandrake AND Redhat 6.1), altest Sucurty Fixes & etc.
Apache Values for Time To Live etc as per Distributed Ones.
gcc 2.6.2+
>Description:
Runaway process attempting to redirect a webpage to itself.
child Process apears to live beyond normal 10 mins, 
consumes all memory, starves and crahes other daemons like Sysklogd.

Trouble showed up under intense Serving due to HtDig Web Indexer on our Ethernet 
(http://www.htdig.org) which apears to open a single 
Child for all communications. 
Apache may crash up to several hours AFTER the process has ended...
may be a Bug in HtDIG too- But Apache should not be vulnerable like 
this I think...

This makes Apache vulnerable to malicious use of user-defineable commands.

>How-To-Repeat:
Do Like So:
make on a server http://www.foo.com/~someuser:
/home/someuser/public_html/.htaccess:
ReWriteEngine ON
ReWriteRule * http://www.foo.com/~someuser
(Points To Itself! Yea, I know...)

Trigger:
HtDig (http://www.htdig.org)
we run this over Ethernet. It HESITATES at the Page in Question, then moves on. 
Even after HtDig ends,
the single process running as 'nobody' that served the queries 
lives on up to 45 mins, shows up under
top M
as gradualy consumes all Memory (128MB ram!) and 90-100% CPU. (Pentium 233!)
This has in the past broght down sysklogd..
Server has ALL latest Patches, Updates etc..

Thanks!

More Explicit Info available if needed,
>Fix:
tighter control of max Mem. usage and Process Life .. Could not find Docs 
on that.

Thanks!
