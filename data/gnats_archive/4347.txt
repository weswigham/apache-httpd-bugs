>Description:
the problem: sometimes the server will stop but all processes are running.
this means with ps -uxa i see all process but I can't get contact to the
server. When I restart the server with apache restart then everthing
works fine. This comes only in the time with high trafic. 

at this time there are about 20 requests/sec and 40 kByte/second.
about 100 requests currently being processed, 19 idle servers 

Is there a problem with intern buffers?

In http.conf i changed MAX-Clients to 225 but nothing happens.
