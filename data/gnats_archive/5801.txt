>Description:
I am running in to something strange when receiving large amounts of name value pairs from a Html form 
        using a POST method.  It seems the Apache JServ has some limit for the amount of name/value pairs it can receive.
	I would expect this type of behavior when using the GET method but not the POST. Let me back up by saying
	that our development webserver (Java Web Server) runs the code just fine it's only with JServ where the 
	problem arises.  My question is do you know of any configuration file in JServ or Apache that limits a POST
	request maybe for security reason, or do you know of any way to have the "HTTPRequest" object of a 
	Servlet force the webserver to accept any length of an request. It seems very strange that this type of restriction
	would be the default behavior of the Apache JServ.
                This is a database app, the test data which in our case is a very small compared to the real world. In any case the test data
                we are using in the Html from is comprised of (10 name/vaule pairs) * 24 entries = 240 name/values total.  The problem
                that arises is our array which is being filled by the "HttpServletRequest.getParameterValues()" is only receiving half 
                the name/value pairs. Now before you say the array is not large enough keep in mind the are no exception thrown and 
                it works perfectly on the Java Web Server.
 
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a Html form with over 200 name/value pairs. Create a servlet which needs
to recieve all name/vaule pairs using the "HttpServletRequest.getParameterValues()" method.
>Fix:
If there is some type of limit in which Apache recieves POST data this is 
incorrect. The GET method should be limited not POST, acording to CGI and
Servlet standards.
