Linux
>Description:
I have script that pushes zip/gzip files after sending headers 
(Content-Disposition, Content-Length and Content-Type)

The same script works fine with httpd 1.1

But when used with 1.2b8 the httpd server forces 
Content-Type : text/plain

Due to this problem, the browser thinks it is receiving a plain text and 
starts showing it in the browser window.


>How-To-Repeat:
try
http://www.esq.com/download/htm/demo.html
>Fix:
I tried sending header in multiple combinations, but
server somehow forces "Content_Type : plain/text" directive 
at the end of header.

I am properly terminating header by sending two 
carriege return, linefeed sequences.%0

State-Changed-Why:
It sounds as though there may be a problem with how
your script is sending the headers.  Can you please
mail the script source to me at <Coar@DECUS.Org>?

State-Changed-Why:
[Out-of-band solution: The problem was a leading space in
some of the headers emitted by the script.  Customer reports
that removing these fixed the problem.]

Thank you for using Apache!
