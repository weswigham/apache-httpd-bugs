>Description:
The value of PATH_TRANSLATED is buggy.
In our server, after the upgrade to apache 1.3.12 (same config files) several
cgi scripts stopped to work.

See http://www.emmenet.it/cgi-bin/bug/site/Welcome (printenv script)

PATH_TRANSLATED expands to the first "basename-common" file found, in this case
PATH_TRANSLATED="/usr/local/apache/htdocs/site/Welcome.secret-file"
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.emmenet.it/cgi-bin/bug/site/Welcome
bug is the printenv script and show that
PATH_TRANSLATED="/usr/local/apache/htdocs/site/Welcome.secret-file"
instead of
PATH_TRANSLATED="/usr/local/apache/htdocs/site/Welcome"
as it should be.
>Fix:
The behaviour is similar to mod_speling URL remapping...
