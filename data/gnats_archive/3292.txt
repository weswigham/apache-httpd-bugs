SunOS 4.1.4 sun4c, gcc version 2.7.0
>Description:
The documentation for mod_log_config shows that you can use %{FOOBAR}e
strings in a CustomLog line to add contents from environment variables
into log files. I have tried the following in a virtual host:

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%{REQUEST_METHOD}e %{HTTP_HOST}e %{REQUEST_URI}e %{SERVER_PROTOCOL}e\" %s %b" fullurl
CustomLog /logs/testlog fullurl

But in the log file entries, the environment variables are always replaced
by hyphens, e.g. some.site.com - - [26/Oct/1998:10:08:42 +0000] "- - - -" 302 229
>How-To-Repeat:
Try it for yourself !  :-)
>Fix:
Nope.

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Mon Oct 26 08:42:26 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Those are not environment variables, but CGI variables
which are placed into the environment for execution of
CGI scripts.  Apache does not set them all internally on
every request when it isn't executing a CGI due to the overhead of doing so.
