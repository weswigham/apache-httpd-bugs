>Description:
I have a directory that i want to display to the public, so i leave the index.html out of the URL (http://ssquire.dhs.org/mp3s/) and it displays the contents in that folder. However the names of the songs get cut off, how can i move the "last modified" and the "size" frames over enough so i can see the full names of the songs?
>How-To-Repeat:
http://ssquire.dhs.org/mp3s/
>Fix:
no idea, the only way i can think of is if i go in and edit the html document... but that will take hours and everytime i add a new song i will have to go in and do it again.
