Compiler etc. I dont know
>Description:
I have not activated fancy indexing and optins set to indexes
this gives me a list of all the subdirectories as described, but the links are broken, because the terminating slashes are missing.

<H1>Index of /</H1>
<UL><LI><A HREF="/"> Parent Directory</A>
<LI><A HREF="usw"> usw</A>
<LI><A HREF="sarah"> sarah</A>
</UL>

using fancy indexing it works fine:

<IMG SRC="/icons/back.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A HREF="/">Parent Directory</A>
<IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A HREF="usw/">usw/</A>
<IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A HREF="sarah/">sarah/</A>


>How-To-Repeat:
prepare your config file like

IndexOptions
<IfModule mod_autoindex.c>
	IndexOptions
</IfModule>

I think you know it beter.
>Fix:
I think that the problem is causedby the fact, that also the output is different. In the fancy indey the / is also shown on the page. In the <UL> the slash is missing, and maybe because of that it was forgotten to implement it into the <A haref=...> tag. I think it is good, that the / is missing in the <UL>. So just add it to the <A haref=...> tag.

 Here is some more:
 Now I tried to work around this problem using index options with the 
 following parameters:
 
 IndexOptions FoldersFirst fancyindexing SuppressColumnSorting 
 SuppressDescription SuppressLastModified SuppressSize
 
 now there is a ugly border around the icon, because the <img> tag is 
 missing the "border=0" option
 
 see:
 <A HREF="usw/"><IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]"></A> <A 
 HREF="usw/">usw/</A>

State-Changed-When: Sun Aug 19 10:30:11 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
If you are not using fancyindexing, then Apache does not go through and try to figure out if a file is a directory or not, so it does not know if it should add a trailing "/" or not.  That is the way that non-fancyindexing works.

Requesting a directory without a trailing "/" works just fine, Apache then redirects you to the name with the trailing "/".  Apparently this isn't happening on your system, but you don't provide any details of exactly how it "doesn't work".  Most likely, it is related to http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ#set-servername

 Umh... except that there are any number of other cases where Apache may
 have to issue a redirect based on the server name.  "UseCanonicalName
 off" may be an easier, and certainly more correct, fix...
 
 But it's your server...

 Great, it works like this. Thank you.
 
 but I have some questions still if you don`t mind.
 
 -) What is the intention to have fancy indexing different from the list form?
 -) What are the reason to introduce UseCanonicalName, it seams to me, that 
 UseCanonicalName off works just in any case?
 -) and something compleatly different: as it is not possible to asign 
 absolute path for the location of
       HeaderName .head
       ReadmeName .read
 
 and I do not whant to copy the two files into every directory, is tehere 
 some way to define it in one place for every directory ?
 
 Thanks, Hannes
