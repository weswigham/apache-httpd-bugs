>Description:
ap_init_modules() is called twice, once from post_parse_init() and once from master_main(). It is also called when the child tasks are started. 

1) Is post_parse_init() necessary when master_main will initialize all of the modules anyway?
2) I'm trying to initialize a database connection that takes about 25 seconds. I only need to do this once. How can I tell which of the two ap_init_modules() calls from the main task I'm in? I can't set a flag in my module because reiniting clears all the variables.
3) How can I tell if I'm initing from the main task or a child? I need to make sure my main task init code doesn't run in the child.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
post_parse_init() looks to be unnecessary.
Make a flag in the server_rec struc if main or child task.

State-Changed-Why:

I would suggest a static value to tag the completion of
your database init routine.  Once it's initialized, the
function can return on later attempts without harm.

I don't see this particular code path ever being touched
again in the 1.3 generation server.  Apache 2.0 has been
significantly overhauled in the config parsing area, and
should provide you the hooks you desire.
