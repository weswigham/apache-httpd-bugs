>Description:
If in an htaccess file you have the line:
  ErrorDocument 403 /Errors/Forbidden.html
And in a subdirectory of where that htaccess file is present, you create a 
directory that is chmod'd such that it is not world read (example: chmod 700),
the ErrorDocument 403 is NOT read in and the default is used.

PR #2409 disregards this example saying, "Submitter says ... isn't a problem
after all", but it is. Didn't want this case to be forgotten about.
>How-To-Repeat:
create an htaccess file with the line:
  ErrorDocument 403 "Customized Forbidden Error Message
then create a subdirectory under that parent directory that contains that
htaccess file and chmod the directory to something like 700
When that directory is tried to access from the web, the default standard
forbidden error message is used, not the custom one from ErrorDocument
>Fix:
Similar to the fix in PR#2409, they are quite similar, I am unable to test 
if the fixed PR Report #2409, will fix this PR Report as well.

State-Changed-Why:
First, it isn't necessary to open a new PR if you simply
wish to ask that a previous one be reopened.

Second, I am confused by your description of the problem
as "Inability to customize error 500".  You were already
told that was fixed.

Third, the problem you describe with 403s is essentially the
same as the previous one.  It appears to have been fixed
by the commit that fixes your previous report.

Thanks.

 If you had read the response to your previous PR, you would know that the
 real problem is that when doing merging of directives as walking down a
 tree, the merge was not "completed" until the entire tree was read.  This
 means that if it aborted in the middle, due to an invalid htaccess file
 entry, a directory it couldn't read, etc. then the settings higher up the
 tree wouldn't be used.  That was fixed.
