State-Changed-Why:
The message "httpd.pid overwritten" is just a warning.  Apache
will continue to try to start up when this message occurs.

Sometimes this message is because apache is still running
from before.  A new apache will try to start and will 
overwrite httpd.pid but will usually fail to bind to the
right port and will exit after writing a message about the
bind failure to error_log.

Maybe apache is already running when you try to start 
apache and get this message?  You can use ps and netstat
to see if it is already running.

If apache wasn't already running and apache won't successfully
start back up:

1) is there a core dump?
2) are there any other messages in the error_log?
