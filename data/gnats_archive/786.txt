>How-To-Repeat:
Don't know for sure? 
I just compiled Apache_1.2.0 on and ALPHA running redhat to get it.
It seems that when stopping httpd, the damon and/or system isn't closing the sockets.

State-Changed-Why:
This is a problem with your Linux install.  Your header
files are mismatched; perhaps your kernel version doesn't
match your C library version.  You would have to ask somewhere
like a Linux newsgroup for help with this since it is not
an Apache problem.
