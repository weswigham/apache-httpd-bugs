>Description:
BSDI by default wants to install a stripped executable, but if this
happens, then Apache will choke when it tries to dynaload a module.
I found this in DejaNews:
After "make", install with:

        # STRIPPROG=touch make install

and get a nice dynamically linked httpd, *not stripped*. Stripping it
prevents dynamic loading under BSDI 3 -- read dlopen(3).

>Fix:
After "make", install with:

        # STRIPPROG=touch make install

** Please put in the BSD Install notes if you can't do it automatically :)

Thanks!

State-Changed-Why:
In Apache 1.3.7 a --without-execstrip option exists
for this. But it has to be enabled manually, of course.
