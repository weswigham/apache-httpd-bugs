RedHat Linux v7.1 Kernel v2.4.2-2smp
Compiler: gcc version 2.96 20000731
>Description:
Using the following setup

ScriptAlias /CGIWrap /usr/cgiwrap
Action cgi-wrapper /CGIWrap/cgiwrap
AddHandler cgi-wrapper .cgi

Heres the problem, when a POST method is sent to a CGI Script the CONTENT_LENGTH var is set correctly, but nothing can be read from STDIN... Any clues why?

Please don't give me the run around. This is a problem with apache or something you changed since v1.1. which works just fine with the CGIWrap in this method.
 
Thanks for your time
