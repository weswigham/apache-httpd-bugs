>Description:
I check out the know bugs and I found my problem bug(PR#1030). However That was back in version 1.3b and I just downloaded 1.3.19 and the bug is still not fixed. When a value is appened onto a cgi script without an equals like so:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/text?hello
you get an error. All of this has been documented in Pr#1030
>How-To-Repeat:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/text?hello

This works fine for me.

Are you sure this is not an error in your CGI script or
the library that your CGI script uses?

If you are sure this is an Apache problem, please provide
more details on the error you are getting.
