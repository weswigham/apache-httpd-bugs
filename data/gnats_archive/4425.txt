>Description:
i set a htaccess file with require set to valid-user.  the AuthUserFile is wwwaccess, located at the same dir.
using htpasswd i create a user called guest.  password is also guest.  this is the output to the file :
guest:$apr1$/z/.....$md7rl.1tKiSqPPW.r2lnJ.

i didn't know the password 'guest' can create such a long string.  anyway, I try to login using guest but the authentication fails.  i tried other passwds, other users, all fail.
>How-To-Repeat:
juz run htpasswd -c <passwd file> <user name>
>Fix:
no idea wat kinda encryption u use
