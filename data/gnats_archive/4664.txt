State-Changed-By: coar
State-Changed-When: Mon Jun 28 08:31:52 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:

What is the *exact* and full line from the error log?
Do you have any modules that didn't come with the base
Apache kit?

State-Changed-From-To: feedback-closed

State-Changed-When: Mon Jun 28 13:46:47 PDT 1999
State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly simply some CGI script that some
user is running that is outputting things to stderr.  It probably
didn't happen before because they weren't running it before.

 to appear in 1.3.6. 1.3.3 didn't have these.
