>Description:
Yes, I know that SSL doesn't work with VirtualHosts on the same IP (they all require their own IP). This is an issue that I think should be addressed, but aside from that, there is a bit of a bug in its behaviour.

Before I discovered that they needed seperate IPs, I tried to setup two virtual SSL hosts as follows:

--- snip ---
# Virtual host "a"
<VirtualHost 10.1.1.1:443>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/htdocs/a
  ServerName www.a.com
  ...
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/a.crt
  ...
</VirtualHost>


# Virtual host "b"
<VirtualHost 10.1.1.1:443>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/htdocs/b
  ServerName www.b.com
  ...
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/b.crt
  ...
</VirtualHost>
--- end snip ---

If you then surf to https://www.b.com, you will indeed get the DocumentRoot /var/www/htdocs/b , but you will get the CERT from /etc/ssl/a.crt .

While I fully understand that it should never be configured in this way, what Apache should NEVER do, is combine the contents of multiple VirtualHost directives in the same client session.

I should also like to mention that not being able to use VirtualHosts with SSL isn't mentioned anyplace in the Apache documentation that I could find and it is totaly non-obvious to someone who doesn't understand the complexities of the SSL protocol (like me) why you can't do this.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Making SSL work with VirtualHosts would be the best, but I assume there is some technical reason why this isn't possible or it would have been done before.

Alternatively "apachectl configtest" should test for SSL VirtualHosts on the same IP and report it. "apachectl startssl" should refuse to start if more than one cert is bound to the same IP.

and,

I feel it warrents a mention in the core Apache docs in the <VirtualHost> section so people don't fall into the same trap I did.

Keep up the excellent work :)

State-Changed-Why:

As the Apache HTTP Project doesn't (yet) distribute any SSL
enabled technology in the 1.3 browser series, I'm afraid
you will have to refer this issue to your SSL author/vendor.
There are a number of SSL implementations for Apache 1.3,
and we are not in a position to integration such notes.

OTOH, this is an issue for Apache 2.0, which will be released
with mod_ssl incorporated.  Therefore I'm suspending your
report util the 2.0 mod_ssl documentation is incorporated,
and we will pursue the issue then.
