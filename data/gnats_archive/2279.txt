State-Changed-Why:
As the pages that brought you here should have said several
times, this database is for reporting bugs, not for asking
questions about configuration issues.  That said, I don't
know of any reason why a CGI script can't be a Java
application in a shell wrapper.  You may also be interested
in the information available at <http://java.apache.org>.
Thanks for using Apache!
