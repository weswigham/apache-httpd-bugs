I am running Apache server 1.2b8 on my HP/UX
machine and issuing "http://hpeop02.cup.hp.com:85
/fcgi-bin/fcgiSrv on my WinNT inet browser.
I got a error message poping up on my HP/UX
machine where executing the httpd -f /conf/httpd.comf
window. The error message is "Assertion faied:
header.version == FCGI_VERSION, file mod_fastcgi.c
line 3630". I have no clue how this happen.
Please help.
Thanks.

I try to download an image info from my HP box.
Maybe there is a size limit about Apache server
for each transition

State-Changed-Why:
1.2b8 is out of date and can no longer be supported.  Also,
note that fastcgi is no longer bundled with Apache; it
is really a 3rd party product and we aren't able to
support it.  Download a newer version of Apache and
get mod_fastcgi from http://www.fastcgi.com/ and it
may help you problem.  If not, see about contacting them
for support.

Offhand, it looks like the mod_fastcgi you are using is
of a different version than the fastcgi programs you are
trying to run.
