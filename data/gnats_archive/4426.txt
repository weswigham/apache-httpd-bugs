>Description:
I was frustrated because I could not get SSI to produce an output.  The solution?
<!--#echo ...
Worked fine.  However, my HTML files mostly used
<!-- #echo
Which worked with Xitami (PERLSSI) because it would parse through each comment field for the hash and a valid SSI command.
mod_include does not do that.  Instead, it looks for the string literal <!--#

>How-To-Repeat:
Just add any number of white spaces between !-- and the hash.
>Fix:
This should be changed so that any number of spaces (spaces only) may be present between !-- and #

State-Changed-Why:

No.  '<!--#' is the standard SSI directive significator,
and always has been.  That Xitami is allowing whitespace
between the '<!--' and the '#' is non-standard, and their
choice.  We do not intend to dilute the canonical syntax.
But thanks for the report and for using Apache!
