>Description:
Under "USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT"

The other is that the semaphore API allows for a denial of service attack by any CGIs running under the same uid as the webserver (i.e., all CGIs unless you use something like suexec or cgiwrapper). For these reasons this method is not used on any architecture except IRIX (where the previous two are prohibitively expensive on most IRIX boxes).

In many cases this can be avoided by simply upgrading to the latest TCP/IP patches supplied by the vendor, in cases where the vendor has never released patches (i.e., SunOS4 -- although folks with a source license can patch it themselves) we have decided to disable this feature.

There are several performance patches available for 1.3. But they may be slightly out of date by the time Apache 1.3.0 has been released, it shouldn't be difficult for someone with a little C knowledge to update them. 

There have been at least two other experimental implementations of threaded Apache, one using the 1.3 code base on DCE, and one using a custom user-level threads package and the 1.0 code base, neither are available publically.
