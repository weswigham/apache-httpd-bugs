I Dled the 1.3b5 but the "CHANGES_1.3" file in the ftp site already up to 1.3b6 which is not avail, and in the 1.3b5 distribution the "Announcement" file mentioned 1.3beta4 on the top, dunno which one to follow just confusing.

State-Changed-Why:
sounds like you caught us right in the middle of a release;
sorry about the confusion, we'll try and be clearer next
time.  One challenge is that the Windows executable often
gets built days after the official beta or point releases
are rolled.
