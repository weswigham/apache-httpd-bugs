Whist trying to compile Apache Web server, the process fails when trying to compile mod_isapi.c and reports that HttpExt.h is not found. I have searched for this file, but, no success.

Is this something I can obtain?

State-Changed-Why:
HttpExt.h is supplied with MSVC++ 5. You could try re-installing
(making sure you install the include files), or copy
the file manually - it is in \DEVSTUDIO\vc\include on
the CDROM.
