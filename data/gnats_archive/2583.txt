>Description:
In main/http_main.c there are still some calls to perror and fprintf(stderr,
in the midst of calls to ap_log_error.  For example, after getpeername
and getsockname calls.  Those error messages may never be seen, as a result,
and they don't get the benefits of the timestamp mark and log level filtering.
There are other examples in http_log.c, util.c, etc.

Currently I am trying to debug a problem with some of our servers logging
incomplete IP addresses occasionally (just one octet instead of four), so knowing what
happened with getpeername is important.
>How-To-Repeat:
egrep 'perror|stderr' src/*/*.c

>Fix:
Finish the process of converting to using ap_log_error.

Comment-Added:
First, the logging issue with the hostname or IP being
truncated has been fixed, and the fix will be available in
1.3.1 within the week.

Second, note that stderr _IS_ logged to the error log so
those calls will still show up.

In some cases, the log routines can not be used and stderr
is the only choice less.  You are correct, however, that
in some of the cases it would be good to get rid of some
use of stderr.
