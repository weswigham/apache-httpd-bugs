>Environment:
linux 2.0.36, JServ 1.0b3
>Description:
When adding an ApJServAction .tmpl /servlet/weasel in the httpd.conf, the
URL .../whatever.tmpl will correctly start the weasel servlet.

However, the URL ../whatever.tmpl?param=blabla will result in a file not found.
>How-To-Repeat:
Don't have a sample URL, problem is easy enough to reproduce I think.
>Fix:
no, but I'm quite sure it's not an Apache problem, since CGI scripts work this
way, don't they?
