With configuration:
<Directory />
     Order Allow,Deny
     Deny from All
</Directory>
is files accessible for all.

With configuration in .htaccess file is all functionality properly.

 Change from

  deny from all
 
 to
 
  order deny,allow
  deny from all
 
 does not effect.

 Sorry, in previous reply I have 39 degree C.
 
 Revision:
 
 both of ORDER DENY,ALLOW   /    ORDER ALLOW,DENY
 take no effect.
 
 (It mean for <Directory> section, for <Location> it work OK.)
 (Is not it a special character of Win32 platform???)
