Linux 2.2.17 #2 Fri Oct 20 01:21:40 PDT 2000 i686 unknown

Built with PHP3 and PHP4, both with MySQL
>Description:
If I start up the server and do a quick series of 'ls -l' in the log directory, then hit Reload on the browser I've got the site up in, the size of access_log will temporarily grow to a few hundred bytes, then become zero again perhaps a second or two later. Running strace on the first httpd pid returns this:

select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 370000}) = 0 (Timeout)
time(NULL)                              = 973159353
