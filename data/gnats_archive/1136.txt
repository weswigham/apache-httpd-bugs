IndexOptions FancyIndexing SuppressHTMLPreamble 

to either a .htaccess file or the servers configuration file
I get the error  ``Invalid directory indexing option''
even though the documentation for the autoindex module
declares that this is a valid File Index Option.

Note:

IndexOptions FancyIndexing         is accepted fine but
IndexOptions SuppressHTMLPreamble  causes the error to return

ANy information on the problem would be appreciated.

That feature is only in the 1.3 tree.  The docs should probably
say that, I will look at fixing them.

 Thanks after another hours searching I discovered this. It definately
 should say that but doesn't in the module docs. Probably as it is not a
 new command, just a new option on an old command..
 
 Shame it isn't available in 1.2.1 it would be most useful.
 
 PS: yes I will upgrade to 1.2.3 shortly.
