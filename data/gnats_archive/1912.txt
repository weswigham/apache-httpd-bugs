>Description:
I've found that the apache process loses its group permissions after about 2 days and needs to be restarted;  If I run the apache process as some user (we run the NOC server as noc so it can read tickets and stuff) and have noc in /etc/group as being in certain groups, it forgets that.  Once restarted it works fine for another 2 days.
>How-To-Repeat:
If you are very interested in pursuing this email me and I'll set you up temporarily on our noc machine.

State-Changed-Why:
There's nothing I can imagine Apache doing which would cause this.
It could be a kernel bug... or it could be something else.  Are you
sure that the same apache is still running after two days?  Maybe
some restart script is starting a different config file?

There were changes to how this is handled in 1.3... you could give
1.3b5 a try, it may do what you want.

[Response from submitter]
No I am still having this problem.  I've adjusted my scripts not to
require /etc/group permissions for now, but the bug still persists.

Thank you,

State-Changed-Why:
Have you tried upgrading to 1.3b5 (or b7, preferably) as
suggested, to see if the problem has been fixed in the
new code stream?  Have you verified, as requested, that
it's the same Apache daemon process after the two days?
