I have mod_include, according to server-info:


---
Module Name: mod_include.c
Content handlers: none
Configuration Phase Participation: Create Directory Config
Module Directives:
XBitHack - Off, On, or Full
Current Configuration:
XBitHack On
---

The directory the web site is in is, physically, /web/sites/www.megacity.org/html , however, it is referenced (on my 2.0 test server) as /web2.0/sites (with /web2.0/sites a symlink to the /web/sites directory):

lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           13 Jan 16 23:31 sites -> /web1.3/sites

And, since I have tried both, I have:

---
<Directory /web2.0/sites/www.megacity.org/html>
    AllowOverride All
    Options All
</Directory>

<Directory /web/sites/www.megacity.org/html>
    AllowOverride All
    Options All
</Directory>
---

The virtual-host declaration:

---
<VirtualHost 64.71.143.244>
ServerAdmin webmaster@megacity.org
DocumentRoot /web/sites/www.megacity.org/html
ServerName www.megacity.org
ServerAlias www.megacity.org.uk
ErrorLog /web/sites/www.megacity.org/logs/errorlog
CustomLog /web/sites/www.megacity.org/logs/allaccess.log combined
</VirtualHost>
---

the html/.htaccess file:

---
XBitHack        on
Options +Includes +ExecCGI +FollowSymLinks
---

and the httpd.conf:

---
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
---

Yet, the following in my HTML page:

<!--#exec cgi="./gen_quote.pl" -->
<!--#include file="footer.html">

fail to generate the expected output. I appear to have enabled SSI every damn place its possible to do so, yet it still doesn't actually take. What am I doing wrong?
>How-To-Repeat:
You could look at http://www.megacity.org:8080/index.html ./index.shtml also was created to see if it was just an XBitHack error (no dice)

Actually, there are some problems with the early alphas
of 2.0 with respect to SSI.  Fixed in CVS.
