Redhat 6.1 on I386 using apache-1.3.9-4.rpm
>Description:
I have read the doc's inside and out. And cant seem to find any one that has the
same problem that I see with user authentication.  

Using the example at http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth    I can 
get a login prompt and all works fine. Fine for say one directory or one
file. But if I want to restrict access to the whole web site IE the .htaccess
file in at the root of the web server. I get multiple logon requests every time
i go from one html doc to the next on the same web server.

Again all works fine if I set the directory to

<Directory /home/httpd/html/doc>
AllowOverride AuthConfig
Options None
</Directory>

then place my .htaccess file in the directory "/home/httpd/html/doc"
and that will work fine. I will be asked for a user name and password just
once.. The problem I have is multiple sub directorys that need to be protected
from the root down. 

If i do the following:

<Directory /home/httpd/html>
AllowOverride AuthConfig
Options None
</Directory>
And place the .htaccess file in the root of the web page /home/httpd/html
now I will see multiple login windows that will popup. This happens when I use
netscape or IE. I have this problem on 3 of my Web servers. One of them 
is used for Computer Based Training (CBT) the other 2 I have setup for Big Brother
the Real nice Network monitoring tool. On all the above Apache web servers I have the
same problem.. 

I hope that I missed something simple? Thanks for your help and time..
>How-To-Repeat:
I have only tried this on a Redhat 6.1 intel. So if you have Redhat6.1 with
apache give it a try...

State-Changed-Why:
This is entirely based on what the client does.  You have to make sure the
AuthName directive is the same if you have multiple configs that require auth, and you are accessing the server
with the same hostname in all cases; if you access a directory without a trailing "/",
for example, you may be redirected to a different hostname for the same machine which causes your browser (_not_ apache) to proprt for the password again.
