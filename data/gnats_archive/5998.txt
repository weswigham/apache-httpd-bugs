>Description:
Can't find this in FAQ or on bug reports (should I try harder?!)

We're attempting to proxy a GEAC library web system via ProxyPass - GEAC likes to return escape characters in the URLS to which clients are directed.

Everything works beautifully until an ESC25 character is received within the URL (any position). This causes the server to send back a Bad Request Error

Tested this on Win32, Redhat - both on proxying system and via simple .conf setup.
Error does not seem to present itself outside of mod_proxy.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up any ProxyPass directive, e.g. ProxyPass / http://www.altavista.com/
try and access http://127.0.0.1/%25anything (or /%25 )
You should get the Bad Request error

Is there anything in the error log about the request?

 The error log remains empty, both under Win32 and Redhat. Standard error
 reports do make it in there, but nothing related to this.
 
 In access log: (I've 'n'd out the IP).
 
 nnn.nn.nn.nn - - [18/Apr/2000:07:23:42 +0100] "GET /%25 HTTP/1.1" 400 293
 nnn.nn.nn.nn - - [18/Apr/2000:07:25:59 +0100] "GET
 /QUERY%40%68%25%69geactest HTTP/1.1" 400 293
 nnn.nn.nn.nn - - [18/Apr/2000:07:26:22 +0100] "GET
 /QUERY%40%68%25%69geactest%20%20test HTTP/1.1" 400 293
 
 These are all random test URLs. They only result in a '400 Bad Request' if
 the %25 escape character is included. Without it (examples 2,3), you get a
 more understandable 404.
 
 Hope this helps.
 
 Yours,
 
 Dave.

 Hiya!
 
 I'm confused as to why issue 5998 in the apache bugs db has been closed.
 
 The note on the issue states that I did not reply to the feedback request -
 however, as you can see from the problem log, my feedback is directly above
 the 'no response' area.
 
 We have a customer who is being seriously inconvenienced by this issue - I
 will attempt to upgrade them to the latest ver, but I would appreciate any
 help and advice as to whether this issue was resolved?
 
 Many apologies for this direct contact..
 
 Best,
 Dave.
