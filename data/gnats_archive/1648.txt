>Environment:
win95 sr2 with MS TCP/IP dialup
>Description:
using the win95 binary from your site I installed and configured then ran:

C:\Program Files\Apache>apache -s -d .
Apache/1.3b3
httpd: cannot determine local host name.
Use ServerName to set it manually.

I am dialed into an ISP and my machine does not really have a hostname.
so what do I give it as a hostname?

i have scanned every bit of docs, FAQ and a couple of newgroups looking
for clues before bothering you with this.

State-Changed-Why:
It means that Apache cannot determine the hostname to
use to refer to your machine when it sends out redirect
responses. You either need to configure your machine to
have a name (under Control Panel|Network), or use the
ServerName directive to give it a name (any name that
resolves to your IP address will do. If you are only
using it locally you could even use "localhost").

Have a look at

  http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#servername

for information about the ServerName directive.
