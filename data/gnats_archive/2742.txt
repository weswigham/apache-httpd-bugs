>Description:
Hi, we've had this problem a couple of times now. After starting and stopping
the apache server a few times we get the error message (in error_log) 
"semget: no space left on device" and the apache server won't start.  The only 
solution has been to reboot the machine (not ideal). 
>How-To-Repeat:
problem seems to be hardware/OS related as the same code runs fine on 
our dec alpha. Starting and stopping the apache server a few times seems to 
cause the problem.
>Fix:
sorry, no idea, semget is something to do with semaphores (according to the man
pages) but I'm no unix guru.

State-Changed-Why:
How are you stopping the server?

Is it ever crashing or are you always stopping it properly?

You can get a list of semaphores that may be left over with
ipcs and force them to be removed with ipcrm.

 Hi,
   I'm stopping apache server with kill -TERM <process id>. The machine
 does not crash when apache produces the semget error.
 I will try the commands you've suggested next time we encounter the
 problem.
 
 Cheers,
      Dave H.
