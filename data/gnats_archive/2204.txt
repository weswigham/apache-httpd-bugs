Hello, sorry to email here, but I couldn't find any other way to email Apache.  I'm 
emailing about www.beer.com -- it has some Apache files on it.  I beg you, as 
a responsible owner of an excellent domain name, either put up something on your 
server or release the domain name www.beer.com.  I know all us beer-enthusiasts
would appreciate it.  Thank you.

We have nothing to do with www.beer.com, and are
completely unable to do anything regarding it.  You need to
contact whoever owns the domain in question with whatever
your issue is.

 Hi Marc, I appreciate your response.  The reason I left email with
 Apache is because if you visit www.beer.com, you'll see that Apache
 information and art is located there in the listed directory.  If your
 site (apache.com) is copyrighted, then www.beer.com should not have your
 info there.  I invite you to visit that URL and see for yourself.
 
 By the way, I did get the email of the domain owner from Internic and
 have already emailed him.
 
 Thanks again for your response.
 
 
 Brian
