>Description:
I have not been successfull in getting a Name Virtual Server configuration
using

<VirtualHost host.name>

to work. I got a huge variety of the most bizzare and incomprehensible effects
though. And I actually don't even know whether it is possible to implement it
that way sincee the docu is not explicit about it. I have finally only
succeeded after changing to

<VirtualHost IP.IP.IP.IP>

I'm sure you understand that it can be useful to >not< explicitly state the IP
number in the VirtualHost directive - it'd make at least my life easier.

Nevertheless, >if< it is >not< possible to have Name Virtual Hosts with the
VirtualHost directive using host names then please, please, please, please
say so in the docu. It would have spared me a week (!) of trying, reading
the docu, FAQs, HOWTO's, asking ppl etc.

I am willing to update the docu and submit it for control to spare you the work
and spare others the hassles when updating. I'm refering to the following pieces
of docu which are not exact enough:

http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#namevhost
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#virtualhost
http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/name-based.html

Please make it clearer or let me do it.

>How-To-Repeat:
Should be clear from the Description

State-Changed-Why:

Using hostnames in virtual host configurations is almost
always a bad idea, but if you think you can improve
our virtual host documentation you are most welcome
to do so.
