>Environment:
WinNT 4.0 - Servicepack 4
Apache compiled with Visual C++
>Description:
I'm using Apache 1.3.3 on WinNT 4.0, with Apache:Session 1.17 and Apache:Win32.
Session works fine, but when Apache is cleaning it's memory then the session data 
is also gone (I use shared memory to store the data). 
I have to login again. Is there anyway to tell Apache not to destroy the session?
>How-To-Repeat:
It's a bit difficult. There isn't any information in the errorlog, but I can see
it happening with WinNT's taskmanager. 
>Fix:
?
