 I am not sure if this is the right place to send the message.
 However, I am refring to the bug I had entered a couple of
 days ago.
 
 I think that the problem is in the perl script dbmmanage that
 comes with it.  The reason I believe so is that I downloaded
 the older version of apache 1.2.6.  I used its dbmmanage to
 create my database.  It worked with both verions 1.2.6 and
 1.3.6..
 
 
 Thanks

State-Changed-Why:

Sounds like the script picked the wrong dbm from its list.
Try hardcoding the appropriate -lxdbm entry in dbmmanage
as the first entry in the list of formats.
