Gcc 2.8.1
>Description:
I have built apache 1.3.0 on Solaris 2.6 sun4m and Solaris 2.6 x86 with 
PHP 3.0.1. When I run `httpd -v` to get the sub-version info, all I see is:

% ./httpd -v
Server version: Apache/1.3.0 (Unix)
Server built:   Jul 16 1998 21:35:56

I just noticed this because I recently upgraded Mysql (again!).

It doesn't seem serious in nature, though Apache had dumped core about a 
week ago and I don't have the tools, know how, time at this point.

Running the server seems fine. I ran a test php routine to see if php works:

<?
    phpinfo();
?>

and that seems cool.
>How-To-Repeat:
run solaris 2.6
cd ~/apache_1.3.0
configure --prefix=/blah/blah/apache
vi src/include/ap_config.h ( STATUS need to be defined as 0x2 not null )
cd ~/php-3.0.1
configure --with-apache=../apache_1.3.0 --with-mysql --with-gs --with-zlib --enable-track-vars
make; make install
cd ~/apache_1.3.0
configure --prefix=/blah/blah/apache --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a
make
src/httpd -v

No

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Sun Jul 19 00:04:08 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Correct, '-v' does not include text added to the server
string by modules.  This is because, to do so, Apache would
have to parse the config files, and call the init stages of each
module.
