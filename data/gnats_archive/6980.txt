>Description:
Compiling Apache/2.0 alpha 9 on Irix 6.5 with SGI's MIPSpro 7.2
compilers generates over 1,600 remarks and warnings:

85      104             definition of xxx in /usr/lib32/libnsl.so
                            preempts that definition in
                            /usr/lib32/mips4/libc.so
134     265             weak definition of xxx in /usr/lib32/libnsl.so
                            preempts that weak definition in
                            /usr/lib32/mips4/libc.so
        (-lnsl is not necessary but configure uses it anyway)

Plus 17 "top_builddir changed after being used" warnings from make
itself, and that's all for a 32-bit build.  Compiling 64-bit doesn't
work at all, but I didn't really expect it to.  Also, configure fails to
detect netinet/tcp.h (previously reported as PR#6459 which is still
open) and there are problems with the test directories (which lack
makefiles but are attempted to build anyway, unsuccessfully) that force
me to use "make -i" or else have the build (and make install) fail every
time.

The ASF rejected the patches I contributed to eliminate Apache/1.3's
similar abundance of verbiage.  I choose not to waste my time again, but
I thought maybe somebody else would like to clean up at least some of
these compilation issues.  I think the fact that there are so many makes
Apache look bad (I believe in strictly warning-free code), but maybe
nobody cares since most folks use less stringent build tools like gcc
and gmake.

The complete output from configure and make is too large to include here
so is available from:
        http://oss.sgi.com/projects/apache/out.2.0a9
>How-To-Repeat:
I turned on as many modules as I could to expose as many warnings as
possible:
env CFLAGS="-fullwarn" configure \
        --prefix=/a/mja/apache2.0a9 \
        --with-maintainer-mode \
        --enable-modules="file_cache \
                cache \
                disk_cache \
                ext_filter \
                status \
                info \
                suexec \
                cgid \
                vhost_alias \
                speling \
                rewrite \
                so \
                mime_magic \
                cern_meta \
                expires \
                headers \
                usertrack \
                unique_id"

State-Changed-From-To: open-analyzed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Fri Mar  2 10:37:17 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
I have looked through http://oss.sgi.com/projects/apache/out.2.0a9.

Some of these warnings will always exist... Examples:

===> lib/apr/shmem/unix
        cc -fullwarn -g -g  -D_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS  -c -I../../include -Imm shmem.c
"shmem.c", line 64: remark(1174): parameter "cont" was declared but never
          referenced
  apr_status_t apr_shm_init(struct shmem_t **m, apr_size_t reqsize, const char *file, apr_pool_t *cont)

(because many APR functions have parameters which are not necessary
on all platforms; also many Directive processing functions have
parameters which are made available by the configuration code
but not used for particular directives)

"http_core.c", line 3289: remark(1209): controlling expression is constant
              AP_BUCKET_INSERT_BEFORE(eos, e);

(because we frequently use macro constructs which use constant controlling expressions)

(not an exhaustive list)

These probably won't go away until we know of a platform where it
is invalid and/or somebody wants to make the exports.c generation
more complex:

"exports.c", line 286: warning(1048): cast between pointer-to-object and
          pointer-to-function
  const void *ap_hack_apr_kill = (const void *)apr_kill;

Others have been fixed:

e.g., top_builddir warnings from make (at least they went
away on Tru64)

(not an exhaustive list)

Many others can't be investigated properly by somebody with no access 
to an SGI machine:

"htpasswd.c", line 668: remark(1196): function declared implicitly
      unlink(tempfilename);
      ^
"mpmt_pthread.c", line 188: remark(1196): function declared implicitly
      chdir(ap_coredump_dir);

(not an exhaustive list)

others I will fix right now and reference this bug:

"mpmt_pthread.c", line 190: remark(1506): implicit conversion from
          "unsigned int" to "long":  rounding, sign extension, or loss of
          accuracy may result
      kill(ap_my_pid, sig);

(I'll look for more which have obvious, risk-free solutions)

It is very possible that since 2.0a9 there are new warnings
on SGI.

There were some comments in the original problem report about 
Apache not caring about warnings.  This is simply not true.
For many months we have tracked any change to warnings or errors
from configure or build on a number of platforms.  Any change is 
attended to as soon as practical.  The unfortunate truth is
that we do not have access to all platforms on which our users
deploy Apache.  When this is the case, the best way for users
to deal with problems with warnings (IMHO) is to pick a single 
problem to solve, solve it, and post the patch to either 
new-httpd@apache.org or dev@apr.apache.org with an 
explanation.

State-Changed-From-To: analyzed-closed
State-Changed-By: trawick
State-Changed-When: Fri Mar  2 18:33:32 PST 2001
State-Changed-Why:
As much as practical has been fixed in the current CVS 
repositories for Apache and APR.  Some warnings not mentioned
in an earlier update had already been fixed.  Many more
warnings were fixed for this PR.

Here is a synopsis of what went in.  Warnings not related
to observable behavior were not mentioned in detail.  Some
code near or intertwined with code causing a warning was
found to be in error and was fixed.

Hopefully a build of current code will be relatively clean,
especially after certain expected warnings (mentioned in a
previous update) are filtered out.
