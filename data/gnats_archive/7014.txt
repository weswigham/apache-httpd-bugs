>Description:
httpd.conf (in a virtualHost):
	RewriteMap access prg:/path/to/my/script
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/proxy
	RewriteRule ^/proxy/(.*)$ ${access:$1}

my script:
	#!/path/to/perl
	$|=1;
	while(<STDIN>) {
	  print $_;
	}

The rewrite log give me allways the following information:
map lookup OK: map=access key=the/good/value/of/$1 -> val=

val is allways NULL.
