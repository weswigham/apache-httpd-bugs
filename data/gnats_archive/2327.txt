SunOS salada 5.5.1 Generic_103640-20 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-30
gcc version 2.8.1
>Description:
if i configure Apache using the new autoconf-style script, and use the --compat
option for a 1.2-like directory structure, after installing and trying to run
it, it complains that it can't find /net/httpd/salada/etc/mime.types
whereas it should be looking for /net/httpd/salada/conf/mime.types, since conf
is the old-style location for such files...

The release candidate for Apache 1.3.0 seems to fix this
problem. Try downloading it at

ftp://ftp.apache.org/httpd/dist/apache_1.3.0.tar.gz

Note that this is unreleased still, but it should be very
stable.

Thanks for using Apache!
