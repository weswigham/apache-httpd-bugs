>Description:
I am running non-ip based virtual hosts. I recently had to switch the
IP address of the host. After switching this address, Apache would load
my last virtual host web page AS the main web page for the server.
I had to comment out the last VH, reload Apache, then un-comment out
the last VH and re-load apache again.

Simply give it a try yourself....
>Fix:
I have no clue how to fix it, as you can imagine this was a real pain
trying to find the problem...I spent all day on it :%2

State-Changed-Why:

I hardly believe that this behaviour is caused by an
Apache bug. Are you sure that you setup the new IP
correctly in your DNS or there is no other local
DNS problem?
