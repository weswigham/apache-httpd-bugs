>Description:
I ported the cronolog programm for use with TransferLog option to WinNT.
I got two different behaviors as I tried to run apache from command line and as
NT service.
Command Line version of option:
TransferLog "|c:/apache/bin/convlog.exe c:/apache/logs/access%%Y%%m%%d.log"
NT service version of option:
TransferLog "|c:/apache/bin/convlog.exe c:/apache/logs/access%Y%m%d.log"
I do not know why the command line call of apache requires the double
percent symbols instead single ones.
>How-To-Repeat:
Request the cronolog exe from me or try to get it from the cronolog homepage.
>Fix:
Check the NT pipe call of external programs. No other suggestion known. Sorry.

State-Changed-Why:

Windows command shell will otherwise interpret the %env% 
as an environment variable, if double % symbols are not
used.  Also, we have additional issues about quoted filenames,
although I don't have my notes handy.  I'm tagging this
report to remind myself extra docs are required with the
piped log Win32 syntax.

By the way, will Apache as-a-service accept the double
percent signs?  Just curious without the time to try it out
right now.

Comment-Added:

One additional footnote.  Quoting may behave oddly as well.
To pipe to a long filename, say foo<sp>bar.log, the command
must use the following quotes:

TransferLog "|""c:\program files\apache\bin\logger.exe" "c:\logs\foo bar.log"""

Note the extra set of double-quotes after the vertical bar, 
around the entire command.  Strange that it even is parsed
correctly, but that's the correct syntax on NT.
