I'd just like to say that I'm quite impressed with the quality
of Apache and am interested in seeing it continue to prosper.

>How-To-Repeat:
Set the ACTION of any FORM to any object which does not recognize POST methods.
Submit form.  I'd expect any attempt to use a POST method with an object which
does not recognize the POST method will not return a list of ALLOWable methods.

Oh, if I only had the time to examine the module's code .

 Try doing it with:
 
 POST /foobar HTTP/1.0
 
 You did not include the HTTP/1.0 so the server assumes HTTP/0.9 which of
 course has no headers in the output.  I tried against 1.2b8 and it had no
 problem issuing an Allow header. 
 
 Thanks for the compliments.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Sat Apr 19 16:19:55 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Your request is an HTTP/0.9 request and the response
is a valid HTTP/0.9 response.  If the request is changed
to a valid HTTP/1.1 request then Apache will respond with
an Allow header.

Thanks for using Apache!
