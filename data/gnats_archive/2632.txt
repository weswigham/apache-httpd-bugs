RedHat 5.1 stock installation with Apache 1.3 custom compile (including PHP 3.0.1 module).
Kernel 2.0.34 on an i686.
>Description:
For a directory on the server, access permissions were set as follows:

<Location /directory>
deny from all
allow from .homedomain.com
</Location>

The error and access logs showed that some requests from a particular IP in
.homedomain.com were recognized properly and passed through, logged with the 
alpha name of the accessing machine, while others (from the same IP/machine!)
ended up in the error_log as denied, logged with just the IP of the machine.
Doing an nslookup of that IP number from the system results in the reverse
lookup happenning flawlessly. More often than not it's failing to let the 
machine through based on the IP, but sometimes it gets the reverse lookup right 
and displays the pages in that directory.
>How-To-Repeat:
If it's useful, I could set up the same mechanism on a test directory on that 
machine for you. Would need your domain, of course.

State-Changed-Why:
This is probably due to some DNS problem somewhere.  What is
the real IP and hostname of the machine being denied?  Is
it only happening for one machine, or for multiple ones?
Is the machine running its own named locally, or is it
using a remote system?  What is the contents of /etc/resolv.conf?

 There are two reverse DNS servers listed for 208.203.240 in the outside
 world:
 
 240.203.208.in-addr.arpa.       21600   NS      BOND.FFTW.COM.
 240.203.208.in-addr.arpa.       21600   NS      AUTH02.NS.UU.NET.
 
 However, auth02 claims to know nothing about that zone while bond.fftw.com
 does give a reverse lookup.  This could cause what you are seeing.

  Marc,
 
  I still don't see how that would explain the server presenting the page
  _sometimes_. A lookup against bond.fftw.com goes like this:
 
 \/\/ /etc# nslookup gtwy1.fftw.com bond.fftw.com   
 Server:  bond.fftw.com
 Address:  208.203.240.10
 
 *** bond.fftw.com can't find gtwy1.fftw.com: Non-existent host/domain
 
 \/\/ /etc# nslookup 208.203.240.9 bond.fftw.com
 Server:  bond.fftw.com
 Address:  208.203.240.10
 
 Name:    gtwy1.fftw.com
 Address:  208.203.240.9
 
  In other words, it will derive the name from the number just fine, but not
  the number from the name. Since the secondary name server seems not to be
  there at all at the moment, I don't expect it's presenting the information
  that the primary name server won't. So sometimes Apache seems to be
  accepting the IP without the double lookup. Either that or occassionally
  bond.fftw.com admits that it knows the number for the name.
 
  Perhaps the real fix is "Use IP's - names aren't reliable." The only
  limitation here would be when the name is a narrower specification than an
  class C, and this is desired.
