>Description:
Although in httpd.conf you supply the place of the PidFile, the script 
apachectl doesn't use that location at all. So, if you have supplied a
different PidFile location, apachectl complains that it can't find the
PidFile.
>How-To-Repeat:
Simply change the location of the PidFile in httpd.conf and do 
"apachectl stop" and "apachectl restart" or "apachectl graceful".
>Fix:
Well, roughly. You could do a grep on httpd.conf in the apachectl script to 
catch the location of the PidFile. But then the problem is to find out where 
the httpd.conf will be located after installation. Shouldn't be that hard to 
change the script a little bit during installation to incorporate the location 
of httpd.conf.

State-Changed-Why:
You need to change the path in the apachectl script if you change
the location of your PID file.  It can't and shouldn't try
to magically guess what *.conf file to use (after all, if it
does that then what happens if you change the location of the
.conf file?).

 Erm... no.
 
 First off, you can put your PidFile directive in any of the config files
 that you may use.  For example, on one system we have shared config files
 for a dozen or so different servers with different configurations, but the
 "shared.conf" file contains the PidFile directive, and it is included
 from the main file.  
 
 Second, just because there is a compiled in default for the config file
 doesn't mean that is what is used when someone runs Apache, since they can
 override it on the command line.
 
 There are simply too many places to go wrong trying to magically guess the
 PID file, especially on systems with multiple copies of Apache running.
