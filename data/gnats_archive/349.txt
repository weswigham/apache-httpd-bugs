>Environment:
Linux Kernel 2.0.0 (Yeah I know!)
Apache 1.27b
gcc/g++ 2.7
>Description:
I am running the server for an mp3 page.  I get few hits, but I have noticed
that each mp3 downloaded is loaded into RAM.  I have no problem with this except
that they are not removed after the download.  I tested it on my roommate's
computer and the problem still exists AFTER he closes Netscape.

Here's my helper:
audio/x-mpeg			mp3
>How-To-Repeat:
hit guido.reshall.calpoly.edu:6669 and download something
however, it's not anything visible to you...I suppose I could make an account
called apache if you are REALLY interested in seeing it.
>Fix:
well...I guess it would be possible to find the leak..

State-Changed-Why:
I've never seen this problem on linux and I have servers 
serving large mpegs and quicktime movies... apache itself 
doesn't do anything special with mpegs.  Are you sure that
your browser is not chewing the memory?

Thanks for using Apache!
