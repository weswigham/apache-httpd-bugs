State-Changed-Why:
This is a known bug in some versions of IBM's AIX
C compiler.  They are aware of it and are looking into
fixing it.

In the meantime, the workaround you suggests works but
shouldn't be necessary.

Comment-Added:
The AIX compiler problem which gave the error of
"on Expected </Files> but saw </Files>"  has been fixed.
+  A set of PTF's which correct the problem are available from:
+  http://service.software.ibm.com/support/rs6000
+  The PTF's are:  U462005, U462006, U462007, and U462023 through
+  U462030.  The PTF's have been tested and do indeed fix the problem.

Thanks for using Apache
