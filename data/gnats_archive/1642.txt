>Environment:
I have done a SetEnv and PassEnv of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the httpd.conf file and restarted 
the server. But the CGI scripts which were working stopped working suddenly
telling that some LIBS could not be found. I had to make a CSH wrap around for these
scripts so that they run.

There is no use trying to stop and start the server again.
Can u explain me either how to fix this or will this be fixed later.

>Fix:
I created a WRAP around in csh which sets the LD_LIB Path and then calls the 
corresponding Perl script

State-Changed-Why:
Why are you setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  What are you trying
to set it to?  It should be obvious that if you try to
set it to something incorrect then programs will stop working.

Don't use PassEnv and SetEnv at the same time; read the docs
to see what they do.
