>Description:
Install 1.2.4 with includesNOEXEC and call a bit of server parsed html with
<!--#exec cmd="/bin/date"--> (or any other system command  . . . i.e. xterm, finger  . . . etc.)  If you don't get the date, please tell me why.  

access.conf included below

# access.conf: Global access configuration
# Online docs at http://www.apache.org/

# This file defines server settings which affect which types of services
# are allowed, and in what circumstances. 

# Each directory to which Apache has access, can be configured with respect
# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that
# directory (and its subdirectories). 

# Originally by Rob McCool

# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.

<Directory /home/fidelity/public_html>

# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".

# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you (or at least, not yet).

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks IncludesNOEXEC

# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
# override. Can also be "All", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo", 
# "AuthConfig", and "Limit"

AllowOverride None

# Controls who can get stuff from this server.

order allow,deny
allow from all

</Directory>

# /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.

<Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin>
AllowOverride None
Options None
</Directory>

# Allow server status reports, with the URL of http://servername/server-status
# Change the ".your_domain.com" to match your domain to enable.

#<Location /server-status>
#SetHandler server-status

#order deny,allow
#deny from all
#allow from .your_domain.com
#</Location>

# You may place any other directories or locations you wish to have
# access information for after this one.

State-Changed-Why:
And what URL are you trying to access?

If it is something under /~fidelity/, then
what does "echo ~fidelity" return?  That
is the path you have to use; /home may be a symlink, in
which case your restriction would be for the wrong directory.

 My apologies . . . I was using improper directory directives in the access.conf.  If you do not limit
 things consistently across all directories then exec cmd will plague you even if your root directories are
 set for includesNOEXEC.
