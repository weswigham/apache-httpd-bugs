>Environment:
SunOS www-test1.sol.no 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-4
>Description:
On Solaris, the SIGXCPU signal is set to be ignored when Apache is started
by init from a script in /etc/rc2.d.  As a result, cgi scripts are not killed
when their CPU time limit has expired.  The fix is to reset the handling of
SIGXCPU signals to SIG_DFL, as the patch does.

State-Changed-Why:
Oh yuck, I thought signals were all reset to default across
exec()... but nope you're right, SIG_IGN is maintained across
exec.  That seems wrong.  But oh well.  Thanks for the patch,
I applied it to 1.3b6-dev.
