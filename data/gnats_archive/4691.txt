>Description:
I attempted to control access on my server fora particular directory and get a logfile error that states '.htaccess unknown command'. I've checked over the config files several times. The Module ApacheModuleAuthAnon.dll is enabled in the config file, and booted. A page does appear..(server error 500 - Internal Server Error)When the .htaccess file is removed the page loads, but I'm left unprotected:( I have checked the spellings etc.. Any advice.. is it the dll's?

 What's the content of your .htaccess file that causes the error message?

 Don't use your word processor to edit text configuration files. Or if you
 do, save them as textfiles. Apache doesn't read word documents.

 It wont matter what the context or file data is there ..but heres a
 sample of some of  the info that i found and am trying here..
 
 
 I have edited that file to the point wher there wasn't anything in it to
 where it was setup ffor username and password access. i used examples of
 the .htaccess file from the net and found several pages on the net.. i
 used the password generator ato generate the passes as well here and
 assigned that file as well. If the .htaccess file is removed from the
 directopry the page Wil load without the error 500.
 
 
 
 <fontfamily><param>Courier New</param>AuthUserFile user/.passwd
 
 AuthGroupFile /dev/null
 
 AuthName "My private page"
 
 AuthType Basic
 
 
 <<Limit GET POST>
 
 requir user guest
 
 <</Limit> 
 
 
 and there is a space after the <</Limit> as advised on a few websites as
 well.
 
 The problem is that when the file is there, it tells me that its as
 'unknown command' in the Apache error logfile..

 What is the *complete and exact* text of the error line in your
