>Description:
I have installed the Apache server to run the BSCW system from bscw.gmd.de. Unfortunately,
it stops running sometime during each night, when it is not used. To make sure that it is
not the BSCW system that causes the problem, I started a separate httpd process on another
port last night. After verifying that it was running correctly (showing the lcoal homepage),
it was left in essentially idle state during the night. Today, the browser gives first the 
error message "Document contains no data", then with the next click the connection just waits
forever. ps shows all child processes as "<defunct>". After stopping the server as described
in the docs, the browser reports that the connection was lost (so a connection is made bit
not responded to). Wehen the server is restarted, everything work as expected for a while.

The only workaround I have found is to make a script with at which restarts the server. It seems
to work (not disturbing anything else) but it does not feel proper..
>How-To-Repeat:
See above. Perhaps it is due to the server being idle too long?

State-Changed-Why:

Please make sure that you have installed the latest
TCP patches from Sun.
Additionally you may want to try the lastest 1.3 beta
(but 1.2.4 is known to work with Solaris 2.5.1).

 Is your ServerRoot on an NFS mounted filesystem?  If so use the LockFile
 directive to point at a file not on NFS... like "LockFile
 /var/tmp/htlock".

 The last tip did the trick. It seems that apache does not take well to
 running on
 an afs system. After changing the location of the Lockfile it seems to work OK.
 I suggest that this should be added to the installation instructions, it
 would have
 saved me a week or two....
