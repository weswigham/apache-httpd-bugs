State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and related newsgroups.
Please ask your question there.
Please also search the FAQ and the bug database.
Thanks for using Apache!

Hello,

What version of Apache do you recommend installing on a DEC Alpha running
OSF 3.2c ?

Are there any Binary versions available to download?

Are there any special considerations or adjustments that we have to pay
attention to?

Best regards,

Nasser Hajo
