Hello,

I'm using cronolog has described in your FAQ but when I'm trying to re-read my configuration files using apachectl restart, the father of all httpd is waiting for the cronolog sub-processes to finish. I have to kill them by hand and then all is going ok. As I have a lot of virtual hosts so a lot of cronolog processes, it's quite boring.

Is there a workaround ?

Thanx for any help

Regards
>How-To-Repeat:
yes. Each apachectl restart does the same
>Fix:
Just have to kill any cronolog
