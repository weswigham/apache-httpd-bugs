Sun Ultra1 running Solaris 2.6 with almost current patch level.
>Description:
No matter how you change the makefile, httpd always looks in a path that has fixed information.

For example:  when httpd gets the httpd.conf, goes to {$prefix}/{$sysconfdir}/apache/httpd.conf

Now, I've tried using the ./configure options to change it, and I've tried changing what I can in the makefile.  Neither quite fixes it.  I do notice that there is a --compat switch which steps back to the 1.2 version layout which does work to get rid of the apache part of the path.

Also in relation, your --help for ./configure lists the paths as PREFIX/var, not PREFIX/var/apache

>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I would say that this should be striped out entirely, most people run only one httpd so it seems silly to have this another layer up.  Myabe adding a --suffix switch which defaults to null to allow people to add this is the best alternative.

 Erm... exactly what are you doing?  
 
 You should not be editing _ANY_ makefile to try to change this.
 
 Are you using Configure or configure?
 
 Please give an exact example of how you want things to work and what
 you tried to make them work that way.
