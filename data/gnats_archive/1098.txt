State-Changed-Why:
I'm not sure I understand.  Why do you think that you
should be able to have multiple ServerNames?  You are probably
seeing some odd side-effect of a combination of IP-based
and non-IP based virtual hosts.

There can only be one ServerName.  If you want it to recognize
other hostnames when using non-IP based virtual hosting
use ServerAlias.

 Apache 1.3.9
 Win98
 Installed from binaries
 Perl from activestate, build 519
 
 If I do a system() call to a program, the program runs, but the system()
 
 call never returns.
 
 The command sent to system() is like:   "c:\xx\program.exe <input.txt
 >output.txt"
 The program runs, writes its output file and exits.
 However system() never returns.
 
 Running the same code on a different WEB server (Microweb) it works
 fine.

Subject: general/1098: multiple Listen statements
Date: Wed, 30 May 2001 12:47:29 -0700

 I would actually like to request that apache IGNORE multiple Listen
 statements, and perhaps to just log an error, but continue.
 
 My situation is this:
 
 I have one main server that does nothing, really, but at the bottom of
 the main httpd.conf file, I include lots of virtual servers.  Sometimes
 I have one ip address with lots of different port #'s (I need Listen,
 otherwise the virtual server can't use that address), and sometimes I
 have lots of ip addresses with the same port# (port 80 or 443).  I would
 like to just use one template for all of my virtual servers, and
 currently they have one Listen statement per included virtual server.
 
 Unfortunately, because of this conflict between multiple virtual
 servers, I can't do that; I have to manually maintain all these Listen
 lines.
 
 Does this sound reasonable or am I doing something wrong?  Is there a
 different/better way to make ports available to my virtual servers?

Subject: general/1098: Unable to find ApacheModuleJserv.dll
Date: Wed, 14 Nov 2001 17:07:48 +0100

 I had the same problem integrating Apache 1.3.22 and Tomcat 4.0.1
 
 My unterstanding now is:
 The Modul ApacheModuleJserv.dll is related to the old Apache JServ.
 In my environment (W2K,Java 1.3.1) Apache JServ 1.1.2-2 and Apache 1.3.22 ar
 working together.
 *Follow exactly the instructions from howto on
 http://java.apache.org/jserv/install/howto.win32_install.html*
 The ApacheModuleJserv.dll will come with this installation.
 I did not compile the Source !!!! ->  Compiling with the wrong compiles is
 not a goog idea.
 
 You have also to download the Java Servlet Developmet Kit 2.0   (this is not
 an actual Version -> search in the SUN Archive)
 
 In addition i integrated also Tomcat 4.0.1 with the Apache 1.3.22. The
 ApacheModuleJserv.dll has noting to do with Tomcat 4.0.1.
 Tomcat 4.0.1 :
 http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/release/v4.0.1
 Dowload also the webapp-module-1.0-tc40-windows.zip from
 http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/release/v4.0.1/bin/win32
 /
 After unzipping this file, follow the instructions in "INSTALL.txt".
 
 On my W2K Apache 1.3.22, JServ 1.1.2 and Tomcat 4.0.1 are running.
 I have problems with the HelloWorldExample (Tomcat) running from Apache.
 After pressing the reload button in IE5.5 Apache will hang. running
 HelloWorldExample from Tomcat will work fine.
 
 Hope this can help you
