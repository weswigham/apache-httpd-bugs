>Description:
I have a directory with the following permissions set:

drwxr-x---   4 wwwadm   www          1024 May  6 22:59 mirror/

The server runs as

User nobody
Group www        

-> I verified it by a CGI-script which runs id: uid=99(nobody) gid=60(www)

I do not use suEXEC of CGIs -> so I believe that the uid/gid should be the 
same as if I try a GET within the dir. BTW: the server is standalone 
Port 80 and startet as root

if I try to GET a document within the mirror directory (see above) the request 
fails with the following Error:
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /mirror/ on this server.

I should mention, that the mirror dir is within the following Virtual Server
configuration:
<VirtualHost www.server.com>
        ServerAdmin wwwadm@server.com
        DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html/www.server.com
        ServerName www.server.com
        ErrorLog logs/www.server.com-error_log
        TransferLog logs/www.server.com-access_log

        UserDir /home/httpd/html/www.server.com/user

        <Directory /home/httpd/cgi-bin>
                AllowOverride None
                Options None
                AddType application/x-httpd-cgi sh
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

So the absolut path to the mirror dir is /home/httpd/html/www.server.com/mirror
If i change the permissions of the mirror directory to 755 (drwxr-xr-x) 
it works.

If you ask yourself why I need (rwxr-x---) for this directory, here is the 
answer -> I want to hide certain parts of the "www-space" from local users 
since this part is password protected by .htaccess (this works -> 
with rwxr-xr-x)

 This really should work fine.  
 
 What are the permissions of the files in the directory?  ie. if the
 directory is world readable by the files are not, does it work?
 
 Are you sure there are not two group www's in the /etc/group file?
 
 Double check what group it is running as.  Do something like:
 
 root@alive:~/archive/apache/apache/src# ps ax | grep httpd
  4007  ??  Ss     0:25.11 ./httpd
  7223  ??  I      0:00.01 ./httpd
  7228  p2  R+     0:00.04 grep httpd
 root@alive:~/archive/apache/apache/src# gdb httpd 4007

 Where 4007 is the pid of the _parent_ httpd process.  Be sure the gid
 returned (65533, in this case) is the gid of www.
 
 Are any of these directories NFS mounted?

 I have had two groups www in my /etc/group file... 
 
 I am terribly sorry (I should have checked this before sending a bug
 report) (but I didn't even think about that the misbehaviour could be a
 result of a misconfiguration in my group file) 
 
 
 Thank you very much for your help.
