>Environment:
SunOS u5 5.6 Generic_105181-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
GCC-2.8.1
>Description:
For performance reasons we built our own adduser/deleteuser programs with 
the default ndbm.h that comes with Solaris-2.6.  Apache was not able to parse
the files created with this software.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Change the code from get_dbm_pw() in mod_auth_dbm.c from:
--------
  q.dptr = user;
#ifndef NETSCAPE_DBM_COMPAT
  q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr);
#else
  q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr) + 1;
#endif
--------
and change it to:
--------
  q.dptr = user;
  q.dsize = strlen(q.dptr) + 1;

Of course, I'm quite certain the #ifndef statement is supposed to effectively 
do this.  But, maybe there is an error in the code.  I figured I would pass it
along to you to take a look.  It seems that my NETSCAPE_DBM_COMPAT should have
been defined, but was not.

State-Changed-Why:
dbmmanage doesn't do anything magic, so it is almost certain
that there is a bug in the code that you use rather than a
problem in Apache.

Since changing the code to use the NETSCAPE_DBM_COMPAT section
works for you, then that almost certainly means you are creating
your dbms in the wrong format.  For use with Apache, they
should not have null terminated strings.  You are probably
including the null terminator in the dbm, which is the
"Netscape format".
