State-Changed-Why:
Can you please describe what you would like to see in
the logfile?  How would you like to see these distinguished?
And I'm assuming you're referring to the proxy cache,
correct?

State-Changed-Why:
Proxy doesn't currently log cache hits/misses to the server
log file. Currently this is considered a debugging function,
and can be enabled to stderr (see mod_proxy.h).
