to port 80.

State-Changed-Why:
Did this work properly with earlier versions?  Are you sure
you added the -DNO_SLACK in the correct place, ie.
the EXTRA_CFLAGS line in the Configuration file, and ran
Configure?

I'm assuming it fails when you HUP it?  All the time or
only sometimes?  There have been (and still are) numerous
bugs in Solaris's TCP stack, especially 2.4.  Have you
applied all Sun's recommended patches (available from
http://sunsolve.sun.com/)?

I'm not sure what you mean by "server doesn't invite".
Can you not connect?  What happens when you try telnetting
to port 80?  Is httpd still running?  Any messages in
the error log?
