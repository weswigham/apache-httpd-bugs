I have compiled apache just fine, even added the support for proxy in the Configuration file.  When ever I launch httpd, the httpd.conf file has an error that states "Invalid command ProxyRequests On"  What is wrong?

State-Changed-Why:
In addition to Chuck's message, be sure you are running
the version compiled with proxy support.  Do a:

	httpd -l

and be sure mod_proxy is included, then a 

	httpd -h

and be sure the ProxyRequests command is there.

 You are running the wrong binary then, which explains your other problems. 
 That is the behavior you will probably get from 1.1.  Perhaps you have a
 httpd binary somewhere in the path that is getting called before the one
 you want.  Change to the directory where the one you want to run is and do
 a ./httpd to be sure you run the one in the current directory.
