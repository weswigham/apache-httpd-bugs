>Organization:
>Environment:
Red Hat Linux 7.0 Kernel 2.2.16 with Apache 1.3.17 and Apache JServ and JDK1.3
>Description:
We are using a statement like "Session session=Session.getDefaultInstance(props,null)" in a Servlet in order to initialise a mail session. When this is included as an independent Java application, it works - but gives an "Internal Server Error" when used as a Servlet or JSP.

/* Session session=Session.getDefaultInstance(props,null);

                session.setDebug(sessionDebug);

                try{
                        Message msg=new MimeMessage(session);
                        msg.setFrom(new InternetAddress(from));
                        InternetAddress[] address={new InternetAddress(to)};
                        msg.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO,address);
                        msg.setSubject(subject);
                msg.setSentDate(new Date());
                        msg.setContent(messagetext,"text/html");
                msg.setText(messagetext);

                        Transport.send(msg);



                }catch(MessagingException mex){
                        mex.printStackTrace();
                } */

If I uncomment this code, it gives me a "URL not found" - but if I comment this block - the servlet atleast works a bit!
>How-To-Repeat:
I guess you should try that code snippet as a servlet.

State-Changed-Why:
Not a JServ problem, it is a configuration problem. You are either missing the mail.jar in your classpath or some other problem.
