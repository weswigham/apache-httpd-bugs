State-Changed-Why:
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you are trying to say.

You say you are running Apache 1.2 on NT, but 1.2 doesn't
runn on NT.

What verison of Apache are you running?

What platform are you running on?

Can you give an example URL?  Why do you think anything
is wrong with Apache?  Isn't it more likely your HTML
is just messed up?

 I ask again, can you give an example URL.  Why do you think anything is
 wrong with Apache?  Isn't it more likely your HTML is just messed up?
 
 If you can't be more precise about your exact problem, I'm afraid we can
 do nothing to help you.  This is almost certainly not a bug in Apache.

 I didn't say the problem is in apache.
 I only wanted to know if anybody has similar problems and if so how to
 solve it. The micorsoft and netscape pages didn't gave me an answer.
 
 I can't give you url because it's on our local intranet to which you
 don't have any access. An I can't give you any access.
 
 Cheerio, Ron

This is the Apache Bugs Database, your mainline into the 
hearts and minds of some of the crankiest people on earth,
the Apache Developers.  It is presumed that by posting here
you are stating that you have conclusively determined that
the behavior you are witnessing is due to a bug in Apache,
and if you're a Good Internet Citizen, you will have whipped
out your handy debugging tools, figured out exactly what 
went wrong, and provided a patch for us to throw into the
server to fix it, for all mankind.  This is *definitely*
not the place to post "this looks weird" kind of messages.
The proper ettiquette would be to send messages like that
to a relevant USENET newsgroup first, or some other type
of discussion *forum*, which this is not.

Now, just to not sound like a complete SOB, I would suggest
you take your page and deconstruct it - start removing tags
and constructs and such until you get at least something to
render.  I'd have to say that a good 5% of the pages I view
on the internet come up blank in Navigator 4.04, and this is
most likely due to invalid HTML causing real problems for the
HTML parser in the browser.  It is most likely not an Apache
problem, though we would love (honestly!) to know if it really
was.
