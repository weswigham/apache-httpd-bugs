>Release:        1.3.19
>Organization:
>Environment:
Win32 environment, NT 4.0 SP6, VC++ 6
>Description:
If apache is started by a windows service, it inherits standard pipes stdin, stdout, stderr as -1.  This causes apache to fail.  What should really be done is if the pipe is -1, then set the pipe to the appropriate.  Now Apache can be spawned properly by a win32 service.
>How-To-Repeat:
Create a windows service and have that service start apache.
>Fix:
Enclosed is a patch from 1.3.19 that will fix this bug.

State-Changed-Why:

This is not a bug in the Apache code, but a failure of the
executive (the application launching the apache parent
process) to pass appropriate handles.

Apache 1.3.20 now opens the appropriate handles that the
Windows SCM (Service Control Manager) failed to create.
However, that doesn't affect the responsibility of whatever
'helper app' might be starting apache to create appropriate
handles if you bypass running Apache by itself as a service.
