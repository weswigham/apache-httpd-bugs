OS : Windows95 - OSR2
Apache : binary file release 1.3.6 issued from Apache Org. servers
>Description:
After configuring Apache in a windows95 environment for supporting user authentification
a "authorization failed" pop up box is displayed when required.

The error logged is :
"...user user_name: authentication failure for "/cgi-bin/admin/CGI_FILE.CMD": crypt() unavailable on Win32, cannot validate password"
For your information I am currently running some REX cgi programs (e.g. .CMD files)

I also understand we cannot have the same password encryption as in a Unix environment. I read in the Laurie's "Apache, the definitive guide"
book that it should be possible to have a password stored in the file named by
the AuthUserFile directive with the following format:
user_name:non_encrypted_password.

Even if this is not secure, it should be suitable that the server could at least compare the provided password with the stored password.

I did read some peace of Apache code (unfortunately from release 1.6.3) and I saw in the module/standard/mod_auth.c file:

  /* anyone know where the prototype for crypt is? */
    if (strcmp(real_pw, (char *) crypt(sent_pw, real_pw))) {
	ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_NOERRNO|APLOG_ERR, r,
		    "user %s: password mismatch: %s", c->user, r->uri);
	ap_note_basic_auth_failure(r);
	return AUTH_REQUIRED;
    }

The fact seems to be that the crypt() function is not available in a windows environment.
Is there any way to bypass that problem? 
Thank you so much for your help,

Regards,

>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce the problem just add authentification directives in the httpd.conf file
in a windows95 environment and try to reach a password protected document.
>Fix:
To fix it it could be great to have a crypt() function provided either in the mod_auth.c
file (with plateform dependant flag) or in an additionnal DLL module.
