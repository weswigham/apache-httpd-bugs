>Environment:
SunOS alioth 5.7 Generic_106542-07 i86pc i386 i86pc
gcc 2.95
>Description:
When the UserDir directive is used in httpd.conf to set the default directory to something besides public_html
and a cgi file is requested from a users directory, suexec still looks in the public_html directory for that
file, resulting in the error 'emerg: cannot get docroot information' because of course that directory doesn't
exist.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up apache to use suexec. set UserDir to something other than public_html (I use etc/www for historical reasons). Put a cgi
file into your directory (don't foget to enable cgi), then try to get that file. if you put a logical link
from public_html to your directory getting the file will work.
>Fix:
The following patch to src/support/suexec.c will help in diagnosing the problem, and also give much
more legible error messages for the future, you'll probably want to start from there:
