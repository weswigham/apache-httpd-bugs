used binaries form apache.org website
>Description:
Apache is used as a proxy server (with mod_proxy) for accessing the
WAN. Http and ftp requests are done successfully. But if a client requests an https site (port 443, SSL) the proxy doesn't work anymore. I read that this problem doesn't appear at unix servers.
>How-To-Repeat:
use apache as a proxy and call https sites, apache must work under winnt (win32 in general?)
>Fix:
no
