>Release:        apache_1.3.6 +   ApacheJServ-1.0b5
>Environment:
Solaris 2.6, Java 1.1.3
>Description:
Basicly, if you use Apache as a Proxy AND for servlets/jsp it will
trigger the servlets part for a proxy request, since JServ doesn't check
if it's an proxy request.
>How-To-Repeat:
Mapp http://some.host/proxy/ -> www.apache.org , then do a call for
http://some.host/proxy/somepage.jsp
>Fix:
