>Description:
I would like to provide on-the-fly compression and tar files through Apache.
e.g. a request for release.tar.gz compresses release.tar

Currently if the file does not exist, the custom Action is not called. The 
compression can be done through the ErrorDocument, but the error code is sent
already and this solution seems inelegant to me.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Add a new directive: Generate: <mime-type> <script> which will call the script.
The script can either send an existing file or provide some sort of automatic 
generation. In addition to the obvious compression and archiving ability, simple
content-negotiation could be used.

 IMHO its not really necessary to create another directive because this
 functionality already can be achieved by existing methods. One is to use a
 RewriteRule to map certain extensions on URLs to your on-the-fly filters. For
 instance when you have written a /path/to/bin/filter-gzip.cgi which reads the
 file via PATH_TRANSLATED and outputs an "octet-stream"-declared gzip'ed
 version of it, you simply can activate it for (perhaps) tar.gz and ps.gz files
 as following:
 
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteRule   ^/(.+\.(tar|ps))\.gz$ \
                 /path/to/bin/filter-gzip.cgi/$1 \
                 [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]
 
 This rule should do the trick for you, even I've not tried it out myself.

 Thanks very much, this does exactly what I want. If you want me to send
 you the short script to become part of the Rewrite Practical Guide, let me
 know.
