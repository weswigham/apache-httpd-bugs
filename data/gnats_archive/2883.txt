As is clearly stated on several pages concerning the
Apache bug database, it is not for getting consulting
help with CGI or basic configuration issues.  Please
ask in the comp.infosystems.www.servers.* newsgroups.

>Unformatted:
I recently download apache win32 and running it on NT when I run a
form.  I get this error:


[error] Premature end of script headers: ....

I checked the bug reports on your site and one talked about "ScriptLog" which I could not

find in *.conf files.

Here is the cgi-bin:

#!/perl/bin/perl

require 'cgi-lib.pl';
&ReadParse(*in);

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "<html><head>";
print "<title>Trouble ticket Results</title>";
print "</head><body>";
print "<h3>Results:</h3>";

print "Hello World\n";

print "</body></html>";

Hope you can help,

Thanks
