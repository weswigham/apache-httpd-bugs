>Environment:
BSDI 3.1 fully patched, gcc
>Description:
Here's what happens when I launch 1.3b5....

[www *root*]:/usr/local/sys/startScripts> /usr/local/sys/bin/httpd_1.3b5 -f /etc/config/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.82
Syntax error on line 685 of /etc/config/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.82:
AuthName takes one argument, The authentication realm (e.g. "Members Only")

This does not happen when I launch non-beta versions of Apache. Here's the offending configuration...

<Directory /archive/www/peninsula/tci>
AuthName   TCI Staff    <<<<<<<<< ***********    THIS IS LINE 685
AuthType   Basic
AuthUserFile   /archive/www/httppass/tci/access
Options Indexes
<Limit GET>
require valid-user
</Limit>
</Directory>

>How-To-Repeat:
I can repeat it and will gladly help if needed. I'd be surprised if you can't repeat it. I'll send my (one) configuration file if you'd like
>Fix:
Thanks for all your fine efforts!

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Wed Feb 25 14:00:23 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
Multi-word AuthName settings now have to be enclosed
in double quotes (eg. AuthName "foo bar").

This probably isn't made clear enough in the CHANGES file.

 It's also documented on the upgrading from 1.2 to 1.3 page.
