Hi Marc,

Erf, I've discovered my confusion. When using the directive suggested by the
"Protect server files by default" section security of the Security Tips (ie
without AllowOverride), I am able to override <Limit> from a ~user's
.htaccess. However with AllowOverride None in the server config file, I am
denied (as is mentioned in the section "Stopping user overriding system wide
settins...").  My mistaken assumption was that the default for a
Directory/Location directive not explicity setting Options and AllowOverride
was None and None.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to mention AllowOverride
None in the "Protect server files..." section of the Security Tips as well.
Also, some mention of the default behavior in the doc pages for the
AllowOverride and Options directives would be a good thing.

Apologies for the misreport...   Cheers  - Gregg
