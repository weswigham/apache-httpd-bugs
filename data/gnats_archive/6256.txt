>Description:
This issue was raised in the maillist back in February, but as of yesterday's
install of JServ 1.1.2, the source file "SimpleFileFilter.java" is still not 
in the Windows .EXE install.  Obviously I can download this directly, but it 
would be nice to get it incorporated, so I don't have to watch for changes.

Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
Download and run "ApacheJServ-1.1.2.exe".  You will notice that the
SimpleFileFilter.class file is in the ApacheJServ.jar file, but no
.java source file exists in "org.apache.java.io".
>Fix:
Only option now if you want the sources is to go get the file manually.
