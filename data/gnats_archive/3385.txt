server: apache 1.3.3 on HP-UX 10.20 using HP ansi compiler
client: winnt 5 beta2 IE 
>Description:
NT 5 beta 2 IE support digest authentication.  I set up a digest directory
using .htaccess using authType Digest and authName PRAS and point the 
authDigestFile to the file created by htdigest.  The authentication dialog
comes up, type in the proper name and password.  It failed.  The
message in apache access.log states a 401 413 error.  Using the same
browser, I was able to access digest test servers  with http://digest-test.agranat.com and http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/testpage.

State-Changed-When: Thu Nov 12 09:26:54 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
The digest auth that Apache supports is the digest auth, as
defined a few years ago.  It will not work with IE's
implementation, since IE's implementation is of a different
standard.  At some point, Apache's mod_digest should be
upgraded to that new standard.
