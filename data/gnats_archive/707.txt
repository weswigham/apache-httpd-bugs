>Description:
I've used mod_info several times before without any problems,
but today I tried to use it on my Solaris 2.4 sparc-machine
without success.

The info page is displayed, but it does not display any
configuration data, eg. for the httpd-core it says
"Current configuration: " and nothing more.
Modules which are unconfigured are correctly displayed with
"Current configuration: none".

State-Changed-Why:
Are your config files and all the directories leading
up to them readable by the user the server runs as, ie.
the user listed in the "User" directive?
Do you get any messages in the error_log?

 *oops* the module reads the config files itself...
 Sorry, that was new to me... yes changing the permissions
 solves the problem. Maybe it would be a good idea to let
 mod_info output a message, if it cannot read the config files.
 
 Thanks for your help.

 It should have logged something in the error_log; Apache is normally
 deliberately elusive with responses returned to the client (eg. most
 things just cause an internal server error, with the real info being in
 the error_log) to avoid giving away any information about the site or its
 setup.  
 
 This is a borderline case, since obviously if you give someone access to
 read your server config then it seems reasonable to let them know it can't
 read it.  Perhaps worth changing.
