>Environment:
Enterprise Ultra 450 (dual processor) running Solaris 2.5.1, fully patched
SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-21 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4
Compiled under any of SUN C 4.0, gcc-2.7.2.1, gcc-2.7.2.3, egcs-1.0.3,
egcs-1.1, egcs-1.1.1
>Description:
Problem can only be described by subjective experience - client connection to server appears to remain open for up to a second after a CGI generated
document has been retrieved. Not dependant on CGI - can be seen even on a simple
shell example CGI. Overall effect is of a much slower transfer rate from site than would otherwise be expected. Snoop of TCP packets between client and server shows nothing out of the ordinary, as does running truss on the server. This only effects dual processor machines, uniprocessors are uneffected. Removing a processor from the machine seems to give much faster download rates!!
>How-To-Repeat:
Enable CGI and request from dual-processor E450 platform, observe difference in transfer after removing a single processor.
>Fix:
Race condition present in server?

State-Changed-Why:
Uh, sounds to me like a kernel problem... the apache code doesn't
need to do anything to deal with SMP boxes.  I'm going to close
this because there's not much we can do with it really... 
any chance you can try 2.6 or solaris 7?
