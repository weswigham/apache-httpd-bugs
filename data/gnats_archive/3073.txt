State-Changed-Why:

There are 3 ways for you to solve this problem.

1)  the fix in 2798, change the (AIX < 43) to (AIX < 42)
2)  Remove the const in the dlerror declaration from
    os-aix-dso.c.  There should be two instances.
OR
3)  Upgrade to 1.3.2 which has a fix for this problem in
    the base code.
