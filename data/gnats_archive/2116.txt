Configure sets optimisation to -O2, but the native compiler doesn't understand it.
Although this only causes irritating warnings in .../src, it stops .../support
from compiling.

State-Changed-Why:
I think this is the wrong place to fix it. Why do
you get -O2? src/Configure do not set it. It is
just in Configuration.tmpl, BUT OUT-COMMENTED.
It is a configuration error when this one is not
out-commented and "cc" is used. Just overwriting
the OPTIM in src/Configuration is not the way
we should fix this. You just have to set OPTIM
correctly because src/Configure shouldn't make 
dependecies between CC and OPTIM himself. It
is too non-trivial in general. 

Perhaps it would be better when we have "#OPTIM=" in
src/Configuration.tmpl or at least only
"#OPTIM=-O" and not "#OPTIM=-O2".

Or did I totally misinterpreted your problem, Ben?

Comment-Added:
Oh wait, I'm wrong. I showed in 1.3b7's Configure.
You are right, the 1.2 src/Configure does nasty
thinks with OPTIM. Hmmm... bet again I think
the partif  egrep "^OPTIM[  ]*=" Makefile > /dev/null; then
    OPTIM=""    # ditto
else
    if [ "x$OPTIM" = "x" ]; then
    OPTIM="-O2"
    fi
    echo " + setting C compiler optimization-level to $OPTIM"
fi

is wrong and this one should be fixed.
It should do at least a case over $CC and only
when it ends in "gcc" it should use -O2 and
else -O. Or even better. Do nothing with OPTIM
as 1.3b7's Configure does. I would prefer the
latter one.
