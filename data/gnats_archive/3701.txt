When you try to run a cgi off of my server, my cgi-bin tries to invoke everything, 
html, jpg, png, txt, everything, and when it cannot invoke them, they just come out 
as broken images etc..

State-Changed-Why:
Please read the docs for the ScriptAlias directive.
That is the whole point of the ScriptAlias directive!  It
says that all files in a directory should be treated as
CGIs.  If you only want to enable certain types of files to
be executed, then please see the FAQ on how to execute
CGIs out side ScriptAliased directories.

 I did read the Docs for the ScriptAliases, and i understand that 
 everything in there is suppose to be exec. But you are not understanding 
 I used to, my friends, and etc... all have the same setup, we have this 
 cgi that we use, and it holds *.jpg, *.html, etc file in the dir. and 
 yet theres still works fine because it does not try to exec. the images, 
 and html files. Mine does, my ScriptAliases are setup the same excat way 
 as theres are, and still dosn't work.
 Do you have any other ideas of why this might happen?
