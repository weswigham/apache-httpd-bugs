>Description:
not a bug, rather a request
when mod_proxy is used, before a request is sent
to the backend server, can we add some headers to
the request.
there are existing, "specialized" modules already:
mod_proxy_add_forward
mod_proxy_add_uri
...
>How-To-Repeat:
none
>Fix:
here is how I created a new module, mod_proxyheaders
a more appropriate name?
cp mod_headers.c mod_proxyheaders.c
change "Header" to "ProxyHeader"change names of function appropriately
r->headers_out changed to r->headers_in
in the fixups call-back, add this
if (! r->proxyreq) return DECLINED;
I can send the C file I used.
the credit should go to the author of mod_headers.
but the mailbox paul@ukweb.com seems to have
reached quota.

State-Changed-Why:

This functionality is available in mod_headers in Apache 2.0.
I believe the directive is called RequestHeader.

It is unlikely that it will be added to 1.3, but thanks
for the suggestion and thanks for using Apache!
