Novell NetWare 5, Support Pack Revision 06
Apache for NetWare, Version 1.03, 21 May 2001, binary distribution from
http://developer.novell.com/ndk/modapach.htm

>Description:
The Apache as WebServer works fine well.
After enabling the proxy functionality, apache does'nt work as proxy.
The error message in the logs is 
"Filename is not valid: proxy:/http://developer.novell.com/"

The related configuration is:
ServerName www.lmkgmbh.de          # Alias vor proxy.lmkgmbh.de
LoadModule proxy_module modules/proxy.nlm
AddModule mod_proxy.c

<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
     ProxyRequests on
     AllowCONNECT 80 8080
     CacheRoot "CACHE:/ICACHE"      # novell-volume:/cache-directory
     <Directory CACHE:/ICACHE>
         Options FollowSymLinks
         AllowOverride None
         Allow from .lmkgmbh.de     # mydomain
     </Directory>
     ProxyVia On
     CacheSize 1024000
     CacheGcInterval 4
     CacheMaxExpire 24
     CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1
     CacheDefaultExpire 1
     ProxyReceiveBufferSize 1024
     ProxyDomain .lmkgmbh.de
</IfModule>

The same configuration (as Proxy)
works under other circumstances like linux-system well.

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: bnicholes
State-Changed-When: Tue Aug 21 13:50:12 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
    Fixed the problem with MOD_PROXY by changing how ap_os_canonical_filename() and ap_os_is_path_absolute() deal with paths and file names.  ap_os_canonical_filename() was altering proxy:http://blah into proxy:/http:/blah which made it incompatible with MOD_PROXY.  Therefore Apache would report back that it had an invalid filename.  This function now recognizes special file names and does not try to canonicalize them.  ap_os_is_path_absolute() also incorrectly recognized a special file name such as proxy:http://blah as being a NetWare volume and path.  Given both of these fixes, mod_proxy now works correctly.  
   It is recommended that ProxyReceiveBufferSize be left at the default unless you really know what you are doing.  This directive appears to conflict with the normal operation of the sockets.
