State-Changed-From-To: open-feedback
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 10:31:00 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

This doesn't appear to be an installer error.  Do you have
the appropriate permissions to install to the d:\ volume?

The cited error is "Directory does not exist", if you
pre-create the directory, does installation succeed?
State-Changed-From-To: feedback-closed
State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Thu Jul 26 23:02:29 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:

User reports hard drive was in a 'less than stable' state
and has since crashed.  Chalk this report up to bad MSI
feedback loop, or an internationalization issue we can't
replicate at this moment.
