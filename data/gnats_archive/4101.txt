It would be better to use <Files .htaccess*> because editors
like emacs leave backup files with suffixes.
>How-To-Repeat:
emacs .htaccess
>Fix:
change <Files .htaccess> to <Files .htaccess*>
(Except that would be costly in terms of CPU time, I don't that's
really an issue here...)

State-Changed-Why:
I just changed it to protect .ht* ... to handle .htpasswd
as well.  It's not that expensive.
