>Environment:
Motorola 88100 CPU
Motorola Unix Sys V Release 3.2
>Description:
When I run the Configure program, I get the following output due to an unknown operating system.  Also, when I did the tar extraction from the download file apache_1.2b8.tar.Z, it would not create any of the files with filenames longer than 14 characters.  In fact, I had to rename the compressed tar file to get it to ftp to my Motorola Unix box.  Here is the output from Configure:

*************************************************************************************
Using config file: Configuration
Using Makefile template file: Makefile.tmpl
Sorry, but we cannot grok "M88100-whatever-buckaroo|R32V3|950814"
uname -m
M88100
uname -r
R32V3
uname -s
buckaroo
uname -v
950814
uname -X
Ideally, read the file PORTING, do what it says, and send the
resulting patches to The Apache Group by filling out a report
form at http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi - or, if your browser
isn't forms-capable, you can send them via email to
apache-bugs@apache.org. If you don't wish to do the port
yourself, please submit this output rather than the patches.
Thank you

Please let me know what I can expect in terms of help with getting your
software ported to my Motorola Unix box.  Thanks!

Very truly yours,

>How-To-Repeat:
I'm sure you understand how to do that....
>Fix:
Is there possibly an existing port that you have available that would most likely run on this OS?  If so, how do I run the configure program, etc, so that it is faked into producing the right executable?%0

State-Changed-Why:
Unfortunately unless you can provide us access to such a
machine we won't be able to port to it.  You're right
a port might already exist, perhaps there's a newsgroup
you could check.  We haven't had any ports submitted for
this architecture.  Have you read the PORTING file?

State-Changed-Why:
I'm pretty sure I misplaced the feedback which said the user
decided to use another platform.  Closing it out anyhow since
we can't do anything without access to this platform.
