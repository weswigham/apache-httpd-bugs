NT 4 service package 5
>Description:
I use the include directive to include e.g. jserv.conf in httpd.conf.
I supply the full jserv path. Here a simple text file instead:
Include "c:\apache.txt"
When starting apache:
E:>C:\Programme\ApacheGroup\apache-1.3.14\Apache.exe  -k start
[Thu Nov 09 15:44:00 2000] [error] Access to config file c:/programme/apachegroup/apache-1.3.14/c:\a
pache.txt denied: not a valid filename
fopen: Permission denied
Apache.exe: could not open document config file c:/programme/apachegroup/apache-1.3.14/c:\apache.txt
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
No.
I tried to use relative paths, but it didn't work.

State-Changed-When: Sat Nov 11 10:01:01 PST 2000
State-Changed-Why:

Please try using forward slashes for pathnames in your
config file.  There were some changes in this area
which should make the next version of Apache work
better in this regard.
Thanks for using Apache!
