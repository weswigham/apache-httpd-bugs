Netware 5 with service patch 4 using Apache 1.3.12 for Netware
>Description:
Hello,
     I have installed Apache 3.1.12 on our NW5 SP4 test box.  I can start
the Apache NLM but when I try and get to the server using a browser, Netscape
4.6, I get a timeout message.  The error_log file has this message in it:

[Mon Mar  6 14:42:47 2000] [warn] make_sock: problem listening on port 80, 
filedescriptor (236) larger than FD_SETSIZE (128) found, you probably need 
to rebuild Apache with a larger FD_SETSIZE[Mon Mar  6 14:42:47 2000] 
[crit] No sockets were created for listening
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
I saw this same error in the FAQ on FreeBSD 2.2 and to fix it you had to 
recompile Apache with a larger FD_SETSIZE, but the Netware version came 
already compiled.

State-Changed-Why:
Here's a fix/workaround submitted by Guenter Knauf
which solved the problem (according to David Seuferer):
---------------------------------------------------------

Hello,
have read your question and wonder if I have tried also with NW5 and SP4 and
it works fine; so perhaps there is something other wrong with the server
or service pack or server config...

I've modified the startup.ncf:
SET RESERVED BUFFERS BELOW 16 MEG=300
SET MINIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS=500
SET MAXIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS=2000
this is similar to what Netscape uses but I think this doesn't
comply with your error...
and I load it in separate address space (as suggested) with a ncf:
search add sys:\apache
load address space = apache apache
