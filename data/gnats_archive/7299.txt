>Description:
Dear sir,

I first develop my web page using JSP and communicate with TOMCAT as web server.
I open a session in my web page and after I will call other ASP page on other machine. After ASP operation, it will call back my JSP page (call RESPOND.JSP).
In RESPOND.JSP, I will get some session value which I store in session before I calling ASP page. It will successful get value from session with TOMCAT (using IE5.5, Netscape 4.7 & Netscape 6).

Then I change the web server using Apache 1.3.17. It will use virtual host features together with TOMCAT. It test it on IE5.5 & Netscape 6 and it will work as before. But when I test it on Netsccape 4.7, after ASP page call back RESPOND.JSP, I can't get value from session. It seen to be open a new blank session after calling RESPOND.JSP.

Please help me to sove this problem asap.

I seem this problem may cause by browse version and I think it should be make some change on httpd.conf on Apache/conf directory.
