>Description:
I've set up a Win98 machine with Apache for web development purposes. I've installed PHP, etc. fine and everything is working alright except getting CGI scripts to execute correctly. The results of trying to call a perl script are not consistant. Here is a sample of my error log:

[Sun May 13 23:31:31 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] couldn't spawn child process: d:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/hello2.pl

[Mon May 14 00:20:00 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] malformed header from script. Bad header=hello: d:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/hello2.pl

[Mon May 14 00:23:54 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Premature end of script headers: d:/program files/apache group/apache/cgi-bin/hello2.cgi

Now, the odd thing is that I made no changes to the configuration after the sixth error message listed above. This was because I got the script to finally execute correctly...ONCE! I tried to execute it again and got an error. Then it worked, and then another error. After the last error, every time I tried to call the script, my browser treated it as a binary and tried to download it instead of the server executing it. Keep in mind that I still hadn't made any changes to my configuration since the sixth error listed above.

I read the report about spaces in the ServerRootDirectory, and changed my document root to one in which there were no spaces, with the new cgi-bin directory under it. I made the changes to the configuration files to point to the new directories, but that still didn't take care of the problem. I stopped getting entries in the error log, but the server still won't execute the scripts! Every time I call a script (ie. http://localhost/cgi-bin/hello.cgi), it opens a download window in my browser.

Now, I'm not exactly new to using Apache, at least on Linux boxes, but this problem has me totally stumped. Is there something specific with Windows that needs to be done to get the server to execute the scripts, is it a bug in the Windows version of Apache that still needs to be addressed, or am I just too stupid to figure out how to set this up on a Windows maching? :) I've checked and re-checked everything and I cannot find out why Apache is acting this way when it comes to executing scripts. Perl works fine from the DOS window, the scripts I used for testing were straight forward (as you can see one was the basic "hello" script), and everything else seems to be set up correctly.

Any ideas?

I have no idea.

State-Changed-Why:
Looks like you've forgotten to change the script's
shebang line (the first #!shellprog line).

Thanks for your interest in the Apache httpd server project!

 Actually, the shebang line is set correctly. I ran tests with scripts that
 were specifically written on a Windows platform, for a Windows platform.
 Scripts which seem to operate normally when using a different web server
 daemon. I still can't figure out why I'm having so much trouble with getting
 them to work while running Apache. But I'll try the newsgroup and see if I
 can get some ideas as to what to look for. I'm thinking that maybe I have
 overlooked something somewhere (although what I do not know). Thanks for the
 feedback, though.
