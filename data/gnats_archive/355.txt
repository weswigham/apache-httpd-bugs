>Description:
If you specify a 401 ErrorDocument, the user is never prompted for a username
and password.  Instead, the URL specified for a 401 error is immediately shown.
This is the same problem reported in bug 221 in the bug database but was
unresolved.
>How-To-Repeat:
To reproduce, create a directory such as ~/user/public_html/test and place this 
.htaccess in that directory:

<Limit GET>
Authname test
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /www/.databases/passwd
require valid-user
errordocument 401 http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/EvalSorry.html
</Limit>

Point your browser at http://server/~user/test/ and you will not be asked for 
a username and password, instead you will be shown the URL given above.
Without the ErrorDocument line above. you will be asked for a username and 
password and if you can't supply a valid one you will be given an Apache generated
401 error.

 Assuming this .htaccess is on www.wpi.edu, try changing that to:
 
 	ErrorDocument 401 /Academics/EvalSorry.html
 
 and see if it works any better.  This is a protocol limitation, not really
 an Apache one.

 Yes, that does fix the problem.  Thanks for the workaround.
