>Description:
I have the Apache 1.3.20 http server running on a Windows 2000 m/c..When it is started it works fine but after sometime it just hangs and even restart doesnt work at times.. We need to do stop the service and then start it again. The error log has the following information :
[Thu Nov 15 01:21:43 2001] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket) failed with errno = 10022
[Thu Nov 15 01:24:41 2001] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket) failed with errno = 10022
[Thu Nov 15 01:25:04 2001] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket) failed with errno = 10022
[Thu Nov 15 01:36:58 2001] [error] (22)Invalid argument: accept: (client socket) failed with errno = 10022
>How-To-Repeat:
I found that primarily the problem lies in the NT session. When I log in to my machine,the Apache server suddenly hangs, I then restart it, and then it works fine even when I logout, but when i login in again it hangs. This is one way in which i could repeat the problem.Hope it helps.
 There's a bug already reported (PR#8473) but i found no way in which i could add a comment to that,to make life easier for the apache developers as well as me.The bug reporter has a similar configuration and problem as mine but wasnt able to repeat the problem with much success. Ideally a comment there wud have been much more efficient for tracking and solving.
