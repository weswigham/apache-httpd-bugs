Ho boy.  Conflicts with the names we renamed to for the 
express purpose of avoiding conflicts.  Fun!

Looks like ap_os_dso_load, ap_os_dso_sym and ap_os_dso_error
need to be renamed.  Try implementing the rename using #defines,
as we did with compat.h.  I hope this situation won't be 
true of all of HPUX's compilers....

Are you sure it's a naming conflict, Brian?  It looks
like a definition conflict between our own os.h and os.c
files..  but I haven't examined it closely.

 I have upgraded since then to 1.3.1 on the same DU 3.2 without problem.
 
 Also, I am afraid the problem arose from an incorrect DNS upgrade. I had
 several other problems (sendmail, etc.). After restoring some of the the
 original DU DNS related files (some header files) the sendmail problem
 disappeared. I did not retry Apache 1.3b6. Version 1.3.1 has been
 succesfully installed since then, though.
 
 Sorry for not reporting this earlier.

Fixed by 1.3.1.  Thanks for letting us know, and for
using Apache!

Oh, you're right, sorry; the compiler is whining about some
things that seem to be to be really silly; I don't know the
ANSI standard well enough to know if this is truly a problem
or the compiler just sucks.

Arpad, try this patch:

Index: os.h
===================================================================
RCS file: /export/home/cvs/apache-1.3/src/os/unix/os.h,v
retrieving revision 1.24
diff -r1.24 os.h
127c127
< void *      ap_os_dso_load(const char *);
---
> void *ap_os_dso_load(const char *path);
129c129
< void *      ap_os_dso_sym(void *, const char *);
---
> void *ap_os_dso_sym(void *, const char *symname);

In other words, add the parameter variable names.  If
that solves it, though, it'll have to have problems 
later on, and having to insert variable names into all
the function declarations is going to be a pain.  Also 
ap_os_dso_error is supposed to be a const char *, at 
least that's what it is in the current code base.
