Slackware 3.5: Linux 2.0.34 #1 i486

Compiler: egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
>Description:
When I run a ./configure in the top level package directory (./apache_1.3.3/), everything works fine until it gets to the part after "Creating Makefile in src".  Then, right after the "time" reports, gcc complains about an installation problem and that it cannot exec `-quiet' because there is no such file or directory.  This problem makes the configure script abort; thus I cannot compile.  Following is the complete output:

root:dt0b1n52:~# gzip -dc apache_1.3.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
root:dt0b1n52:~# cd apache_1.3.3
root:dt0b1n52:~/apache_1.3.3# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --verbose

gcc: installation problem, cannot exec `-quiet': No such file or directory
make: *** [dummy] Error 1
 + doing sanity check on compiler and options
** A test compilation with your Makefile configuration
** failed. This is most likely because your C compiler
** is not ANSI. Apache requires an ANSI C Compiler, such
** as gcc. The above error message from your compiler
** will also provide a clue.
 Aborting!
>How-To-Repeat:
I don't know.
>Fix:
Not really, but this looks like something you just added in version 1.3b7, because it says:

  *) Various bugfixes and cleanups for the APACI configure script:
     o fix IFS handling for _nested_ situation
     o fix Perl interpreter search: take first one found instead of last one
     o fix DSO consistency check
     o print error messages to stderr instead of stdout
     o add install-quiet for --shadow situation to Makefile stub
     o reduce complexity by avoiding sed-hacks for rule and module list loops
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

I think that "...add install-quiet..." part probably has something to do with this problem I am having (since it is part of the bugfixes and cleanups in the configure script and it has a "-quiet", which is what my compiler complains about).

State-Changed-Why:
Check that gcc is properly installed. Nothing in the
Apache distribution should output "foo main" or lots
of "time in ..." lines (although these could could from a
non-standard module, the fact that "gcc -E" isn't found
as the C pre-processor indicates a problem with gcc).

What do running "gcc" and "gcc --version" say?

 $ gcc --version
 egcs-2.90.29 908515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
 
 $ gcc -E
 gcc: No input files
 
 It looks like my gcc should work.  I have recompiled the kernel using this
 exact same setup.
 
 There are no nonstandard modules.  I ran ./configure immediately after I
 unpacked the apache_1.3.3.tar.gz file.

 Actually, it does look like a problem with my system, because I can't
 compile anything else!  Looks like my system is really messed up.  So now I
 am installing a new compiler system.  Thanks for your help!
