>Environment:
OSF1 V4.0 464 alpha, using the Digital's bundled cc
(DEC C V5.2-030 on Digital UNIX V4.0 (Rev. 464))
>Description:
root@kelvin:~web/support 114-ROOT# make CC=cc
cc -I../src -g httpd_monitor.c -o httpd_monitor
cc: Error: ../src/scoreboard.h, line 102: In the declaration of "servers", "HARD_SERVER_LIMIT" is not declared.
    short_score servers[HARD_SERVER_LIMIT];
------------------------^
*** Exit 1
Stop.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
Solution is simply to transpose the following two lines in httpd_monitor.c:

#include "scoreboard.h"
#include "httpd.h"

so that httpd.h is read in before scoreboard.h is.

State-Changed-Why:
I'm not sure what you are talking about.  In the distributed
httpd_monitor.c from 1.2.0, httpd.h is included before
scoreboard.h.  Please be sure you have made no local
changes and try redownloading the file.

 Sorry about this ... during an upgrade, I mixed up the old and new code
 for the support directory. So, this bug report is not applicable and can
 be deleted.
