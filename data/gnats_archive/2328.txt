>Release:        1.3b6
>Environment:
Windows NT workstation Service Patch 3.
Apache 1.3b6 binary distribution.
UserTrack_Module & Status_module loaded
Cookie Tracking on
>Description:
The first entry of a client is truncated in the log, thus:

user1 - - etc
user1.foo.bar - - etc
user2 - - etc
user2.foo.bar - - etc

It's not a serious problem, but it messes up log analysis.
>How-To-Repeat:
Run 1.3b6 on NT, and switch on UserTrack, and examin your access log files. Even if it's supposed to do this, it makes log analysis hard.
>Fix:
No, but switing cookie-tracking off makes the problem go away.

State-Changed-Why:
1. Does this happen with 1.3b7?
2. Is this the cookie log that's getting confused, or one
   of the main server logs?  (You said access_log, but
   your example looks odd.)
3. Can you attach some actual complete example lines from
   your damaged access log?  Be sure to Cc <apbugs@Apache.Org>
   to make sure your message gets attached to this report.

 Don't know yet. Given the CGI bugs with 1.3b7 I have avoided it so far.
 However I could install it for you to test it.

 Access log - sorry I truncated it to save space.

 Here it comes:

 1481

 The log is set up as default, I've not done anything to it. The first line
 here was at the start of a session, the lines above it in the log are fine.

 This problem was fixed by a later version I understand, I have had no
 problems since then.
