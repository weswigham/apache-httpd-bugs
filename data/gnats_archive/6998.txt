 Hello,
 
 I'm writing to let you know that there is a new software product for 12 Step Programs - the 4th Step Self Examination software available at: www.twelvestepsoftware.com. 
 Give the recovering people in your life the gift of being "happy, joyous and free." 4th Step Self Examination is "The easier software way." It is a gift that keeps on giving and if you hurry you can still have it by Christmas. Why not take a look right n ow?
 
 Socrates once said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Sometimes it seems the examined life is too hard to live…especially for recovering alcoholics and addicts. Now the new 4th Step Software Program makes examining our lives easier and faster so  we can get on with the business of living. The 4th Step Self Examination Inventory program is the first in a series of releases that aim to bring recovery and the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous into the new Millennium and the age of technology. Me mbers of all 12 Step Programs can use this terrific program to easily complete a fearless and thorough moral inventory. 
 
 The program is developed for ease of use with its Quick Start Guide and Focus Center. After a brief introduction, the Continue button will advance the user to the main control screen. The Focus Center acts much like a home page that brings the user back  to the basic program choices and re-centers or "focuses" the user on the inventory of choice. A handy 1,2,3 approach maintains an easy to follow step theme. Additionally, built in drop down lists in various sections, spark the reflective process and help  to get the inventory completed in a timelier manner. The program includes a section for creating an entry on people and institutions in our lives that can be associated with any inventory the user chooses - a single inventory or multiple inventories.
 
 The 4th Step Self Examination Inventory Software Program can be used for every area of examination: Fears, Harm, Resentments, Sex, and positive qualities. It can even be used for 10th step inventories. The process is based on and adheres to the 4th step  as presented in Alcoholics Anonymous (Third Edition). Inspiring quotes, definitions and helpful tabs are sprinkled liberally throughout the program. 
 
 We will respect your request for removal. If you wish to be removed from future mailings, please reply with the subject "Remove" and this software will automatically block you from future mailings. Thanks for your indulgence.
