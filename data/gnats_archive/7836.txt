Apache 1.3.19 installed from Debian packages:

ii  apache         1.3.19-1       Versatile, high-performance HTTP server
ii  apache-common  1.3.19-1       Support files for all Apache webservers
ii  apache-doc     1.3.19-1       Apache webserver docs
>Description:
If you use a slash "/" inside a comment "#" in a .htaccess file in the "Allow from" lines the .htaccess file is parsed wrong.

Ie. having this kind of line in .htaccess file:

Allow from foo.bar.baz.fi         # foo/homeaddress

(the content of comment is not important, the precense of slash is)

causes the following into error log, and the client is denied with a 500 error.

[Mon Jun  4 19:44:08 2001] [alert] [client xxx.xx.xxx.xxx] /www/htdocs/foo/.htaccess: syntax error in network portion of network/netmask 

Thus the precense of slash even in comments is mistaken for network/netmask format. Without the slash the comments work OK (although I don't know if they are allowed there as such in the first place...).
>How-To-Repeat:
See full description.
>Fix:
Change the line parser to ignore anything following a hash "#" or something.

State-Changed-Why:
In general, end of line comments are never allowed in directives.
In some directives, the "#" character is a valid non-comment
charachter.  So the problem here is just that you are trying
to put comments where they aren't allowed.  

There is another PR open on the issue of detecting and erroring
out more gracefully when users make such mistakes.
