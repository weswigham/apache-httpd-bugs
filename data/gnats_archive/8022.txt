>Environment:

SunOS 5.8 Generic_108528-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)

>Description:

"%b" "%B" LogFormat directives, which indicated bytes sent to client
for response body, should be "-" "0" for HEAD request--
but actually, the fill file size is logged.

This was caused by setting r->sent_bodyct flag, which indicates to
log r->bytes_sent, set BEFORE checking for HEAD and discarding body buckets.

Setting r->sent_bodyct AFTER HEAD check fixed the problem.

>How-To-Repeat:

* Issue a HEAD request for a plain file.
* Examine the access_log.
  The 7th field should be "-" or "0", but the file size is logged.

>Fix:

#
#****** modules/http/http_protocol.c HEAD logs full content bytes
#
# This patch fixes that "%b" "%B" (bytes sent, excluding response headers)
# directives for mod_log_config, is logged as full file size (should be zero).
