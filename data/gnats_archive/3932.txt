State-Changed-Why:
this source file is included in the current windows
distribution; it doesn't seem to make too much sense to
include it in the unix distribution.

the set of tools currently in use are designed around the
idea of giving users distributions which are processed
somewhat (ie. not straight out of the CVS tree) -- that's
why you'd grab the windows distribution if you want all the
windows source code.
