>Description:
I spent 20 minutes writing a detailed report of a bug, but managed to overlook
filling in the Synopsis because of scrolling issues in my browser.  When I hit
the "Click here to send" button below, I (correctly) got an error message that
said I needed to fill the field in.  However, when I hit my browser's "Back"
button, all of my work was erased!!!
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
YOUR SCRIPT SHOULD BE FIXED SO WHEN THE BROWSER'S "BACK" BUTTON IS HIT, IT DOES
NOT ERASE A PERSON'S EFFORTS!!!
