State-Changed-Why:
If you want it on Netware, either ask Novell to contribute
some resources to making it happen or get some people together
and do it.  Since there isn't anyone around here that seems
interested, it really isn't something that will happen on its
own...

I have doubts as to if it makes sense to run a web server
on a Netware server, but...
