PHP4 Module added.
Apache running as WinNT Service.
>Description:
During shutdown, I get the following error.

Dialog Title: Apache.exe - Application Error
Dialog Text: Instruction at memory address 0x771dfea4 referenced memory at 0x00000004.  The memory couldn't be "written".

This only seems to happen if the server had been restarted.  The message only stays up for about 30 seconds then the system continues the shutdown successfully.  No key press was necessary (it was hard getting the complete message but it came up several times exactly the same).  This also happened a couple of times when I didn't restart the server but it always came up if I did.
>How-To-Repeat:
Restart the server on Windows XP Professional.  Then shutdown the system.
>Fix:
Maybe, avoid restarting the server?

 Just an added note.
 This error does repeat itself exactly.

 You can go ahead and close the report.  After upgrading to version 1.3.22,
 the problem appears to have disappeared.  I didn't realize that 1.3.22 was
 released before when I posted the bug report.
