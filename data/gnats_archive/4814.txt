State-Changed-Why:
This is not an Apache issue but a general Unix issue.  First,
you have to ensure that the filesystem can be written to by
root, presuming you are starting Apache as root as is normally
done.

Second, Linux has a bug in that if you open a file as one
user, then switch to another user, you can not continue to write
to the file unless the user you switched to has permissions
to.  This is a problem with Linux and there is nothing Apache
can do to get around it.
