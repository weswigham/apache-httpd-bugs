NT4.0 SP3 with 1.3.1 executable
>Description:
This is not a problem just a comment. There are freely (GNU) available
crypt function implementations. Is this just a resource issue or are there
some sort of export restrictions?
>How-To-Repeat:
not a problem

Do you need someone to implement?

State-Changed-When: Fri Aug 21 00:41:24 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
There are export issues.  We will probably just use
md5 instead, since there is already md5 code.  However,
it won't be done until someone does it.

 Not from my perspective.  I just don't see it as being worthwhile.
 
 If someone really does want it, then the thing to do is allow the loading
 of a DLL with the function used in, with some common interface, then
 someone could create whatever DLLs they wanted to use for password
 encryption.
