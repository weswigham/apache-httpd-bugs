State-Changed-Why:
This is almost certainly a configuration problem. Make sure 
that you ServerName is configured in httpd.conf. If you still
get the error try running Apache.exe in a window from your server
installation directory and note any error messages. For futher assistance
with configuration problems please address them to the 
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.
Thank you for your interest in Apache!
