SCO Release = 3.2v4.2

>Description:

http_main.c(2339) : error C2166: lvalue specifies const object
http_main.c(2342) : error C2166: lvalue specifies const object
http_main.c(2352) : error C2166: lvalue specifies const object    

Lines at fault do things like:

            ap_sys_siglist[sig] = "";                        

- doesn't like assigning to siglist.

>How-To-Repeat:
Compile n a buggy SCO compiler
>Fix:
Change line 2241 from
const char *ap_sys_siglist[NumSIG];

to
char *ap_sys_siglist[NumSIG];

State-Changed-Why:
The 'const' declaration is valid. Removing it to work around a buggy and incorrect compiler would not be a good idea.
