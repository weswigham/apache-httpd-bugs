You guys have an awful lot of negitivity in everything you do on your website.  I am officially not interested in any of your products or services because you really need to make your website friendlier and much less negative.  Telling people all the things they shouldn't do is not a good way to market yourselves.

If you don't like it, don't use it.  This is for submitting
