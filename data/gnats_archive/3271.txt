The error log shows the following:

file util_os2.c, line 22, assertion "rc==0" failed
Abnormal program termination
core dumped

Everything keeps running and I haven't noticed any serious problems
I haven't seen this in the bug index so if it has been reported please excuse me.
Thanks.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have no clue, I have no idea what causes this, it seems random. I saw it once
in awhile in 1.3.2 release also

State-Changed-Why:
The assert was triggered by an invalid file name.
As of v1.3.6 an appropriate error message should now be
logged instead.
