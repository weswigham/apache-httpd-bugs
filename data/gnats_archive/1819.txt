There are unwanted characters in the output while responding to an HTTP/1.1

>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.apache.org/ produces this problem
http://nil.physik.fu-berlin.de/ (but it is a 1.2.4) also
http://www.freebsd.org/ DON'T produce it
>Fix:
http_protocol.c Line 300: r->chunked = 1 seems to be the reason

State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: dgaudet
State-Changed-When: Mon Feb 16 18:29:12 PST 1998
State-Changed-Why:
This is correct HTTP/1.1.  Read RFC2068, search for chunked.
All clients MUST implement chunked encoding.

The top page of www.apache.org is handled by mod_include, which
uses chunked encoding under http/1.1.  The top pages of the
other sites you mention probably don't use mod_include for their
files.
