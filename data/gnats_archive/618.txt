State-Changed-Why:
Please see PR#467, which is available at:

	http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi/full/467

and see if it applies.  ie. do you use Listen directives?
If so, try defining one of the SERIALIZED_ACCEPT defines
talked about there and recompiling.

You should also verify that you have all the latest 
UnixWare patches applied, especially networking ones.

 You missed a D in SERIALIZED.  Try adding that, re-running Configure and
 recompiling.
 
 For testing, you may want to try removing the -DUSE_SO_LINGER; on many
 systems it can cause problems.
 
 Are you using any Listen directives?

 That worked fine in 1.2B8, when I could type...
