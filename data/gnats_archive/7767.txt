 <BR>
 ''Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from<BR>
 your home for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense<BR>
 one time'' THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!<BR>
 <BR>
 =================================================<BR>
 <BR>
 BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!<BR>
 <BR>
 Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is<BR>
 the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately.<BR>
 Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a<BR>
 national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show<BR>
 to the investigation of this program described below, to see<BR>
 if it really can make people money.<BR>
 <BR>
 The show also investigated whether or not the program was<BR>
 legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are<BR>
 ''absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the<BR>
 program and if people can follow the simple instructions,<BR>
 they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of<BR>
 pocket cost''.<BR>
 <BR>
 DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS<BR>
 PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN<BR>
 EVER.<BR>
 <BR>
 This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable<BR>
 opportunity. I was approached many times before but each<BR>
 time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to<BR>
 see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort<BR>
 and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $<BR>
 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.<BR>

 <BR>
 Here is another testimonial:<BR>
 <BR>
 ''This program has been around for a long time but I never<BR>
 believed in it. But one day when I received this again in<BR>
 the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the<BR>
 simple instructions and voila' - 3 weeks later the money<BR>
 started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the<BR>
 next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So<BR>
 far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have<BR>
 made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again.The key to<BR>
 success in this program is to follow the simple steps and<BR>
 NOT change anything'' More testimonials later but first,<BR>
 <BR>

 <BR>
 If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5<BR>
 months easily and comfortably, please read the<BR>
 following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!<BR>
 <BR>
 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<BR>
 <BR>
 FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL<BR>
 DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!<BR>
 <BR>
 INSTRUCTIONS: ****Order all 5 reports shown on the list<BR>
 below.<BR>
 <BR>
 ****For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE<BR>
 REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the<BR>
 person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.<BR>
 MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT<BR>
 CORNER in case of any mail problems.<BR>
 <BR>
 ****When you place your order, make sure you order each of<BR>
 the 5 reports.You will need all 5 reports so that you can<BR>
 save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST<BR>
 $5 X 5 = $25.00.<BR>
 <BR>
 ****Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of<BR>
 the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them<BR>
 on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send<BR>
 to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also<BR>
 make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in<BR>
 case something happen to your computer.<BR>
 <BR>
 ****IMPORTANT __ DO NOT alter the names of the people who<BR>
 are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the<BR>
 list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step<BR>
 '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your<BR>
 profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will<BR>
 also see how it does not work if you change it.<BR>
 <BR>
 Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it<BR>
 will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their<BR>
 friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get<BR>
 all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we<BR>
 all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do<BR>
 Not try to change anything other than what is instructed.<BR>
 Because if you do, it will not work for you.Remember,<BR>
 honesty reaps the reward!!!<BR>
 <BR>
 1....After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this<BR>
 advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in<BR>
 REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is<BR>
 no doubt counting their fortune.<BR>
 <BR>
 2....Move the name & address in REPORT #4 down TO REPORT #<BR>
 5.<BR>
 <BR>
 3....Move the name & address in REPORT #3 down TO REPORT #<BR>
 4.<BR>
 <BR>
 4....Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down TO REPORT #<BR>
 3.<BR>
 <BR>
 5....Move the name & address in REPORT #1 down TO REPORT #2<BR>
 <BR>
 6....Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT #1 Position.<BR>
 <BR>
 PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!<BR>
 <BR>
 =================================================<BR>
 <BR>
 ****Take this entire letter, with the modified list of<BR>
 names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER<BR>
 CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you<BR>
 loose any data.<BR>
 <BR>
 ****To assist you with marketing your business on the<BR>
 internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with<BR>
 invaluable marketing information which includes how to send<BR>
 bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free<BR>
 classified ads and much more.<BR>
 <BR>
 There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:<BR>
 <BR>
 METHOD #1 : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY<BR>
 <BR>
 =================================================<BR>
 <BR>
 Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it<BR>
 goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out<BR>
 only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing<BR>
 receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much<BR>
 better but lets just say it is only 0.2% . Also many people<BR>
 will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only<BR>
 5,000 each).<BR>
 <BR>
 Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-<BR>
 mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for<BR>
 report # 1.Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-<BR>
 mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails<BR>
 only 0.2% responded with orders. That's = 100 people<BR>
 responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out<BR>
 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2%<BR>
 response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000<BR>
 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million<BR>
 e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders<BR>
 for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails<BR>
 each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The<BR>
 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5<BR>
 <BR>
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half<BR>
 million).<BR>
 <BR>
 Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +<BR>
 <BR>
 2..... $500 +<BR>
 <BR>
 3..... $5,000 +<BR>
 <BR>
 4..... $50,000 +<BR>
 <BR>
 5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00<BR>
 <BR>
 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE<BR>
 WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT,<BR>
 YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!<BR>
 <BR>
 ------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
 --------------<BR>
 <BR>
 REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING<BR>
 OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what<BR>
 would happen if everyone, or half or even one 4th of those<BR>
 people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over<BR>
 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting.<BR>
 Believe me, any people will do just that, and more!<BR>
 <BR>
 METHOD #2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>
 <BR>
 =================================================<BR>
 <BR>
 Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there<BR>
 are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of<BR>
 free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response.<BR>
 We strongly suggest you start with method #1 and add METHOD<BR>
 #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must<BR>
 do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it .<BR>
 Always provide same day service on all orders. This will<BR>
 guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and<BR>
 address on it, will be<BR>
 <BR>
 prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the<BR>
 report.<BR>
 <BR>
 _________________AVAILABLE REPORTS__________________<BR>
 <BR>
 ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always<BR>
 send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT<BR>

 $$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$<BR>
 <BR>
 Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:<BR>
 <BR>
 ***If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1<BR>
 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.<BR>
 <BR>
 ***After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after<BR>
 that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT #2. If<BR>
 you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until<BR>
 you do.<BR>
 <BR>
 ***Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2,<BR>
 YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you<BR>
 , and the cash will continue to roll in!<BR>
 <BR>
 THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER : Every time your name is<BR>
 moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a<BR>
 Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by<BR>
 watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU<BR>
 WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS<BR>
 AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the<BR>
 income you can generate from this business!!!<BR>
 ______________________________________________________<BR>
 <BR>
 FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:<BR>
 <BR>
 "You have just received information that can give you<BR>
 financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK<BR>
 and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in<BR>
 the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined.<BR>
 <BR>
 Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it<BR>
 in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember<BR>
 to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put<BR>
 your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2<BR>
 ...........#5 as instructed above. One of the people you<BR>
 send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your<BR>
 name will be on everyone of them. Remember though, the more<BR>
 you send out the more potential customers you will reach.<BR>
 <BR>
 So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information,<BR>
 materials and opportunity to become financially independent.<BR>

 <BR>
 'My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I<BR>
 am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make<BR>
 pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled<BR>
 to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the<BR>
 whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>
 percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody<BR>
 totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later<BR>
 she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her,<BR>
 and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when<BR>
 the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3<BR>
 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days<BR>
 she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! I<BR>
 was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.<BR>

 ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>
 make up my mind to participate in this plan. But<BR>
 conservative that I am, I decided that the initial<BR>
 investment was so little that there was just no way that I<BR>
 wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''.<BR>
 ''I was surprised when I found my medium size post office<BR>
 box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12<BR>
 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not<BR>
 matter where people live. There simply isn't a better<BR>
 investment with a faster return and so big''.<BR>

 ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but<BR>
 later I wondered<BR>
 <BR>
 if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no no idea<BR>
 who to contact<BR>
 <BR>
 to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed<BR>
 again by someone else.........11 months passed then it<BR>
 luckily came again...... I<BR>
 <BR>
 did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my<BR>
 first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''.<BR>

 ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>
 money with little cost to you. I followed the simple<BR>
 instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started<BR>
 to come in. My first month I made $ 20, 560.00 and by the<BR>
 end of third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00.<BR>
 Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.<BR>
