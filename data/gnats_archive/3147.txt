>Organization:
>Environment:
linux 2.0.33, apache 1.3.2, glibc6 (recent)
mod_rewrite intensive, free hosting high usage.
>Description:
Some apache process eat all cpu and no log nowhere, smells like bug#841
(mod_rewrite and 1.2.1).

apache 1.3.2 and 1.3.1 have it, 1.2.6 seems ok.
>How-To-Repeat:
dont know how to make it happen.
>Fix:
Cpu to 99 means endless loop, no log means before any logging (status dont get
it).
Tried to limit URI size but did not help (down to 200 bytes)
