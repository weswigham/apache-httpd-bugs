 I am a recruiter working with two companies aggressively expanding their national e-Commerce practices. They need Strategy Experts as well as technical and functional individuals that have worked with ERP (JDE/Oracle, back-end and apps), CRM, Supply Chai n and e-Commerce solutions. The positions and salaries range from Sr. Consultant to Partner and both companies will be going public this year (offering stock options to all employees). Would you like to be kept aware of an exceptional opportunity? Please  call me, or provide me with your contact information if you are interested. Career Opportunities
