>Release:        1.3b7
>Environment:
Linux 2.0.33, compiled with mod_perl 
>Description:
I am unable to get a <Files> or a <FilesMatch> Directive to allow parsing of a single file or a few files.
Everything was fine with Apache 1.3b5. 
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be duplicatable anywhere.
>Fix:
I resorted to using the <Directory> Directive for now, although it is a little more taxing on the server.

State-Changed-Why:

Are you using something like <Files /path/to/file.html>?

This was changed in Version 1.3b6 and is no longer
possible (see the CHANGES file).

You have to use something like this:

<Directory /path/to>
  <Files file.html>
   ...
  </Files>
</Directory>
