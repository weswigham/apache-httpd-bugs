>Description:
I have an HTML document in a directory (/lab/toto.html) who call a cgi in 
/cgi-bin/lab/my-cgi. To access to the toto.html file, I have a .htaccess and 
.htpasswd file. You enter your name & passwd, but I have too a .htaccess in cgi,
and this second .htaccess acceed to passwd in the same .htpasswd than toto.html.
The problem is this : After the call of cgi (in POST method), I haven't the
REMOTE_USER define, but if I launch the CGI alone, without the toto.html file,
the REMOTE_USER var is correctly set. I don't understand why...
>How-To-Repeat:
Ok, I give you the URL of this error. Check for http://lab.neuronnexion.fr/sec-lab/w3user
The login is dav and the passwd is dav.
>Fix:
No, but I'm going to see source code..

 I am not exactly clear on what you are doing.  The minimal possible config
 which exhibits the problem would help.
 
 Be sure you aren't using a "Limit GET" when you restrict access to the
 CGI.  That will only restrict GETs, not POSTs.

 	Ok... Sorry for my english, but i'm going to try to be more sharp
 in this mail...
 
 	I have'nt Limit GET in my config file, to reply to your first
 message.
 	I have just an html document (toto.html) wich the access is
 protected by a '.htaccess' and '.htpasswd' file. This page call a cgi, and
 the access to the CGI is protected too. The html document send arguments
 with POST method. In theory, the Web Server must set a variable
 REMOTE_USER that contain the name of user (after .htaccess
 authentification), so I haven't this variable... 
 	But when i call directly the CGI, without arguments, and without
 the HTML page, the REMOTE_USER variable is correctly set...
 
 	So,  I think the POST method not allow the CGI to set this
 variable (REMOTE_USER).
 
 	You can try on my site... I have a page to test who call a cgi...
 http://lab.neuronnexion.fr/sec-lab/w3user/
 	The login is "dav", and the passwd is "dav" too.
 
 This is the source of my cgi : 
 ;---cut---
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 $ru=$ENV{"REMOTE_USER"};
 $ra=$ENV{"REMOTE_ADDR"};
 
 print "Content Type: Text/Html\n\n";
 
 print "Remote User : ",$ru ;
 print "\nRemote Address : ",$ra,"\n"
 ;---end---
 
 P.S : If you don't understand what I want to do, shall I write in French
 to you ?
 
 Thanks, dav.

 	Please, forget my previous message... I'm a real dwarf... There is
 no bug in your server, I have corrected the problem... Like you have say
 me in the last mail, a have a LIMIT Get in my .htaccess file...
 
 	Sorry for all, and excuse me for this lost of time...
 
 (I'm very confuse)
