Netware 5.1
Service Pack 2a
>Description:
Using server side include, include paramenter, for a virtual file, causes the 
server to abend.The server does not appear to lose any services, but each 
time the SSI code is run, the error repeats and the page is not displayed. It is
entirely possible that I have done something incorrectly, but I have searched 
the apache web-site for guidance and can only find info that suggests I am doing
it correctly.  I have not made any modifications to the apache for NetWare code
outside of the httpd.conf file.   No comiliation modifications....nothing.  This
is basically an "out-of-the-box" configuration.

I have included 3 pieces of information.... 
1. The code I use to call the SSI
2. The entry in my httpd.conf
3. The error information on the NetWare console.

>How-To-Repeat:
Recreate the scenario with data similar to what I have provided in the 
"Full Description"
>Fix:
I wish I did, the product is as stable as can be on the Netware platform with 
all the testing I have done.  This is the first snag I have hit.
I would love to test any suggestions you may have.
