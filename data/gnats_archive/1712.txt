>Environment:
Windows NT service pack 3.  Apache 1.3b3 binary distribution.
>Description:
I am evaluating Netscape Calendar Server and Directory Server on Windows NT 4.0.
These servers come with a number of CGI-programs having extension .cgi and also
having no extension at all (like in those good old UNIX days).
The problem is that Apache fails to spawn child
processes from those programs.  As a work-around, I changed the file-extensions
of those programs into .exe, and Apache had no trouble with executing them.
>How-To-Repeat:
Put an executable in c:\apache\cgi-bin, call it doit.cgi
srm.conf contains ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /apache/cgi-bin/
Try the URL: http://apachehost/cgi-bin/doit.cgi
You get: Internal Server Error
error_log says:
[Wed Jan 21 10:52:49 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: c:/apache/cgi-bin/doit.cgi
Rename doit.cgi to doit.exe
Try the URL: http://apachehost/cgi-bin/doit.exe
Try the URL: http://apachehost/cgi-bin/doit

Both URLs now work fine.

No, sorry

I am unable to reproduce this problem.
CGIs with an extension .cgi work for me.

State-Changed-Why:
Hi. This PR has been re-opened because the fix in 1.3b5
caused the #! method of starting scripts to stop working.
We'll work on a different fix for this problem.
