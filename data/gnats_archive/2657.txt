>Release:        1.3.0
>Environment:
Sparc Solaris 2.5.1 using gcc. (I'm guessing more detail here will not further
identify the problem)
>Description:
The documentation indicates the FollowSymLinks option can be used with 
<Directory> but not with <Location>. This would suggest to me that it should 
work with <DirectoryMatch> and not <LocationMatch> It does not, in fact, work
in either.
>How-To-Repeat:
Attempt to add FollowSymLinks to the Options list inside a DirectoryMatch.
>Fix:
Allow this option inside a DirectoryMatch, or update the documentation to 
reflect this behavior. I prefer the first option, as I believe others would too,
or the requirement of FollowSymLinks in a directory would severely hamper
the usefulness of the DirectoryMatch directive.
