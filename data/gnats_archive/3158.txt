Using binary downloaded from Apache site (apache_1.3.2-os2.zip  from 22-sept-98)

History:  The previous version I was using was 1.2.4 and 
this problem did not exist

History:  The previous version I was using was 1.2.4 and  this problem 
did not exist.

If I have have a file named "header", "header.html", "readme" (or 
anything else configured as the header or readme files) the client 
reports an error and the auto-index is never displayed.  Netscape 4.5pr2
reports document empty.  IE 4.0 gives more generic "can't load" error.

Using SuppressHTMLPreamble does not help.
Using plain text files does not help.
If I remove the file, everything is okay.  
What happened?  My headers USED to work in 1.2.4.

If you could e-mail a response to frank.domina@sciatl.com and/or 
ftd@cybermail.net I would greatly appreciate knowing if there really
is a bug or if I'm being an idiot and missing something obvious.  Please help.

Thanks,
Frank Domina
