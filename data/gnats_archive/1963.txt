State-Changed-Why:
The links for LogLevel was added for Apache 1.3b6 now.
But what is "MeatFiles"? There currently is no such 
directive in Apache 1.3. Is this a private one from
an own module by you are did you just misspelled it?

Oh, MetaFiles. Ok, fixed, too.
Seems like I should have used agrep instead of grep ;-)
Thanks for the bug report.
