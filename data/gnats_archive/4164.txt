>Description:
First, the URL for an ErrorDocument 401 directive in a .htaccess file does not
seem to be checked to see if it is a full URL - the URL *is* followed on auth.
failure, even if it is a full URL, which I know is a no-no. ;-)

Secondly, the bug reported in PR 1809 seems to be fixed (it hasn't been closed).
When I define a CGI script the username/password box pops up first.  However, I
think there should be some documentation stating (again, for people that don't
get it) that they should *not* use this CGI script to send a Redirect header,
as users will not get the prompt box if they do.
