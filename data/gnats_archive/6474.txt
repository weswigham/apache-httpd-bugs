I try to use this access.conf
<Directory "/home/httpd/html">
    Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride Limit AuthConfig
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Allow from localhost
    AuthType Basic
    AuthUserFile /home/httpd/html/.htpasswd
    AuthName "Don-Link Base"
    Require valid-user
    satisfy all
</Directory>
