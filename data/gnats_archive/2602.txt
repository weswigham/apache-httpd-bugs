>Environment:
It's not an os problem, it's in the URL parser of apache (the %hh stuff for
quoting special hex characters; HTTP standard says that URL's containing
%hh quoted characters should be equivalent to the ones containing the characters
themselves) 
>Description:
If some browser requests a CGI using %3F instead of '?',Apache will parse
the URL incorrectly and mistakenly search for a file containing '?' 
(e.g. cginame?xxx=yyy/zzz/ttt)

It is true that most browsers never use %3f with a cgi, but I need this
in order to enable windoze clients to download generated files (otherwise
windows will goof up the filename putting the cginame and a ? instead).
So, I modified another cgi to yield url's like
http://server.name.dom/cgi-bin/cginame%3Ffilename=/path/file.ext
so that netscape for windoze will use file.ext instead of cginame? as the
filename for d/l. But now apache says 404 not found, and a system trace 
says apache looks for cginame?filename=/path/file.ext and gets ENOENT.
Did you fix this problem in 1.6.* ?
If not, can you fix it ?
>How-To-Repeat:
Try to replace ? by %3f in a cgi name and load it like that, it will
fail.
>Fix:
When parsing an URL, replace the %xx characters before anything else, especially before searching 
the cgi file.

State-Changed-Why:
The current behaviour is correct.  As URL specs detail,
'?' is a reserved character which are reserved for special
meaning.

For example, see section 2.2 of RFC-1738.

You can _not_ encode all characters, and encoding a
reserved character can and (in this case) does change
the semantics of the particular URL.

 O.K. could be. 
 Now what do you suggest I should use to make Windoze clients
 download cgi results correctly (i.e. use the last part of the url
 and NOT the cgi name) ?
 Or any other solution to restrict access to files based on IP of the client
 and NOT on passwords (those could be sniffed) ?
 Or any means to hack the apache code to accept parsing of %3F in cgi's ?
 Last but not least, would it hurt if this parsing of reserved characters
 (at least '?') would be an option in the apache config file ?(although
 I haven't met yet any cgi containing '?' in it's name)
 
 
 I'd be very greatful if you could help me stop getting bugged by windozers
 wanting to d/l restricted files.
 (on my unix box, netscape does the downloads just o.k., it does not choke
 on the question mark).
