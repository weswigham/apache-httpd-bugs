mod_cgi.c: In function `run_cgi_child':
mod_cgi.c:408: `cld' undeclared (first use in this function)
mod_cgi.c:408: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
mod_cgi.c:408: for each function it appears in.)
mod_cgi.c:408: `argv0' undeclared (first use in this function)
>How-To-Repeat:
Add #define DEBUG_CGI 1 to the top of modules/generators/mod_cgi.c
and make.
