 _____________________________
 There is a book causing quite a stir in African
 American congregations across the country, especially
 among its preachers. N. Moore's, "Pulpit Confessions:
 Exposing The Black Church," questions the moral character
 of the African American Church in the wake of recent
 highly publicized scandals.
 
 "The tables have been turned," writes Moore. "The
 spotlight is not on the unrighteous sinners outside
 the church, but the self-righteous transgressors inside it."
 
 Moore, a former preacher and pastor, speaks candidly
 about his and other ministers' odysseys from sincere
 well-intentioned prodigies to cynical, sinful, showmen.
 He describes in detail the often-profane process whereby
 one obtains credentials to minister in the black church.
 
 Moore offers insight into what he considers rampant
 emotionalism during the African American worship experience.
 "Simply because the preacher sounds good and can make
 you feel good does not always mean that he is operating
 under an anointing from the Holy Ghost." The author also
 challenges many preachers' sermonic integrity by detailing
 what he considers blatant showmanship and plagiarism.
 
 Moore also reveals the thoughts and motivations of both
 ministers and congregations whose power struggles often
 turn violent. "Older members who have been there since
 the first brick was laid will not surrender power without
 a fight, " he writes. "And fight they will . . . sometimes
 to the death."
 
 The African American church has recently been rocked by
 scandal at its highest levels. Moore describes how ministers
 struggle with their public and private selves, which often
 leads to career ending embarrassment. According to Moore,
 though, the preachers should not always bear all of the blame.
 "Many women in the church make it extremely difficult for
 ministers to live righteous lives," he writes.
 
 The author contends that the black church is not Y2K
 compliant. He challenges it to get its house in order.
 "Reverend, what kind of church are you going to present
 to Jesus," he asks. "Will he even want it? Would you?"
