>Description:
If you try to upload a binary file with the PUT methode the server trunkates
and modifies the file (MIME-TYPE: application/octet-stream).
The CONTENT_LENGTH environment variable seems to bee correct, but the server
closes the input stream before i get all octets and substituates some of the
received octets.
>How-To-Repeat:
Install a PUT script and try to upload a binary file, or just use the Netscape
browser for upload a page with an image.
