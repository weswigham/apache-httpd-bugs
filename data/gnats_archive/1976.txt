>Environment:
Using A/UX 3.0.1, gcc, A/UX libraries (not Gnu's)
>Description:
The Spencer regex library must be explicitly
called in by the Configuration file.  The installation
instructions said to file a bug report if this is
required.

The A/UX libraries do not supply strerror, so
-DNEED_STRERROR must be added to the
EXTRA_CFLAGS list in the Configuration file.
This doesn't seem to be documented.

The A/UX libraries do not supply memmove, so
the macro used for AIX must be used.  Ideally,
a NEED_MEMMOVE macro should be added as
for strerror, but this is not currently the case.

It would be nice if there were a list of all of the
-D tweaks that are implemented, with brief
descriptions of what they do.
>How-To-Repeat:
Follow the installation instructions to build on
A/UX 3.0.1 with gcc installed.
>Fix:
See the full description above

 See the src/PORTING file for more documentation.  Maybe we haven't done an
 A/UX port ?  At any rate if you can provide a patch against 1.3b5 we
 should be able to include it in the release.
 
 You may be able to replace memmove with bcopy, but only if your bcopy
 handles overlapping copies.

Comment-Added:
For any real A/UX porting, you should use the gcc-2.7.2 and
the libUTIL.a archive, both are available on
jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov
