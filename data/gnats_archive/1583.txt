>Environment:
Linux 2.0.33
gcc compile 2.7.2.3
>Description:
In the file 'netscapehost.patch' is a small error. After the new host has been
compiled (www. prepended and/or .com appended) the string url is added. 
This should however be urlptr iso url.
>How-To-Repeat:
When you enter as url eg. dell the URL gets translated to

http://www.dell.com/http://dell
>Fix:
change the line 
  strcat(try,url)
to
  strcat(try,urlptr)

A new netscapehost.patch (with the correct linenumbers too)
can be provided if needed.

A new patch against 1.2.6, with your fix, would be great;
send it to me and I'll replace what's there with yours.
Thanks!
