 Readers Digest Feb 2001
 
 Deep abdominal breathing, or belly breathing, helps establish a state of
 physiological calm and can neutralise the negative effects of stress say
 Carl Krucoff and Dr Michael Krucoff.
 
 The belly breathing technique is so powerful that James Gordon. Director
 of Mind/Body Medicine In Washington DC and clinical psychiatrist at the
 Georgetown University School of Comprehensive Cancer Care: Integrating
 Alternative, Complementary and Conventional Therapies, teaches it to
 nearly every patient he sees- from people with advanced cancer to children
 struggling with attention - deficit disorder.
 
 “ When you bring air down into the lower portion of the lungs, where
 oxygen exchange is most efficient, everything changes. Heart rate slows,
 blood pressure decreases, muscles relax and the mind calms.” 
 
 Pamala Peeke, a lecturer in family medicine and author of Fight Fat After
 Forty, also incorporates breath work into her practice, in part by getting
 patients to exercise. She often takes them out for a walk and a talk. When
 she does she says they tend to breath correctly. It’s hard to walk and
 take shallow breaths she says.
 
 Scientific analysis of the air in various parts of the world today reveals
 the frightening fact that the oxygen content of the air appears to be
 declining. In fact, in some larger cities, the oxygen levels of air have
 recently been measured at a distressing 12% to 15%. Now here's the real
 problem: medical researchers claim that oxygen levels under 7% in the air
 are too low to support human life, even for short periods. This staggering
 decrease in the oxygen content of air has aroused a surge of concern among
 many respected researchers. They see direct correlation between decreases
 in oxygen levels and increases in human illness.
 
 Using the Opur canister encourages good belly breathing and at the same
 time gives the correct purity of oxygen.
