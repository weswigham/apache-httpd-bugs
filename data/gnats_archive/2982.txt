>Description:
%f field of CustomLog logs proxy:the-url for proxy: requests, which
%f field of CustomLog currently logs proxy:the-url for proxy: requests
which is redundent. Should it log cache filename for proxy: requests?

At the very least, there should be some way of seeing the cache file name 
of proxy requests at the [info] level of debugging.

 I'm sorry about the dupe; a mail on our mail server at our end meant I never
 saw the reply from lars. In our case it is useful because we are monitoring
 the Apache cache for files and using them when they appear in cache, but 
 in general logging redundent information seems less useful than logging
 potentially useful information that appears nowhere else. It seems to
 me the logical interpretation for %f in the case of a proxy: request.
 
 I'm really sorry about the dupe screwup, and I'll be more careful checking
 the database for followups.
 
 Many thanks,
 
 Mike.
