Did grep rlim_t *.h under /usr/include & didn't find anything.  Did the
same under /usr/include/sys and
got:
baalrog:/usr/include/sys $ grep rlim_t *.h
resource.h:#  define _T_RLIM_T rlim_t
resource.h:#  define _T_RLIM_T  rlim_t
types.h:         typedef uint64_t rlim_t;
types.h:#        define k_rlim_t rlim_t
types.h:       typedef unsigned long rlim_t;
