Windows 98
>Description:
I installed the Apache Web Server as discribed in the documentation. There was a bug because of a known ServerName Problem I fixed like discribed in the FAQ by entering "localhost" as ServerName in the configuration file. So I start the Server, but when I try to open it in my browser a Password prompt appears instead of the "The Apache Web Server is Installed" site. I didnt change any passwords or config files expect the first error. No idea why it doesnt work. Please help!

Nor would I, unless you have .htaccess files hanging around.
Are you still experiencing the problem?
