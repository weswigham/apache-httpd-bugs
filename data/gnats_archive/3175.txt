 Are you sure about this?
 
 Did you change the DocumentRoot and restart the webserver?
 
 Are you sure you are editing the proper copy of the config files?  If you
 put some garbage in (eg. "adlfkjaskfljsdl") your config file, does Apache
 refuse to start?

 Ok,
 i found out that somehow the httpd always looks in the /../apache_1.3.2/etc
 for the config files! If i put the *.conf in there, then the server starts up
 with the proper document root (specified in the
 /../apache_1.3.2/etc/srm.conf).
 Why httpd looks in ../apache_1.3.2/etc when i specify the ServerRoot in
 httpd.conf as /../apache_1.3.2/ is a mystery?! Also in my startserver command
 (see below), i indicate the httpd to point to another specific directory!
 I would like to know which httpd to use for Apache 1.3.2 (in the /sbin or
 /src subdirectory)?
 My startserver command line goes like:
 /../apache_1.3.2/src/httpd -f /../apache_1.3.2/conf/httpd.conf
 If i do not put my *.conf files in /../apache_1.3.2/etc and starts the
 /src/httpd, then the server does NOT start:
 "httpd: could not open document config file /opt/apache_1.3.2/etc/httpd.conf"
 
 And yes, for every change in the *.conf files, i stop n start the server.
 
 Puzzled G. (!)

State-Changed-Why:

The -f flag doesn't define the default value for ServerRoot,
it merely tells the server which file to read first.  Try
using -d instead of -f, and please ask any further config
questions on comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.  Thanks
for using Apache!
