>Description:
Triing to access to any IP-based virtual host with MSIE 4.5 PowerMac, return an http protocol error on browser side
On server side in the virtual host access_log file :
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [06/Mar/2000:09:46:47 +0100] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 4894 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.5; Mac_PowerPC)

My httpd.conf contains :

Listen xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80
<VirtualHost xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80> 
        DocumentRoot "/home/httpusers/xxxxx/public_html"
        ServerName www.xxxxx.com
        ServerAdmin zas@metaconcept.com
        ErrorLog /home/httpusers/xxxxx/log/error.log
        CustomLog /home/httpusers/xxxxx/log/access.log combined
        <Directory "/home/httpusers/xxxxx/public_html">
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride AuthConfig
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

There isn't any problem with browsers Netscape2.02/3.0/4.61 and MSIE 4.0/5.0 under windows, Netscape 4.61/4.71/4.72 and lynx 2.8.2 under linux, etc...
this problem seems to concern "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.5; Mac_PowerPC)"


Please help.

http://www.allier-architecte.com fails with MSIE4.5 Mac_PowerPC
http://www.metaconcept.tm.fr is ok ( same server not a virtual host )
