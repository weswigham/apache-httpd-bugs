>Description:
Bug report #4991 has the full details. Basically though, DefaultTYpe is not
being applied to ReadmeName and as such the file is not being displayed.
>How-To-Repeat:
Use the apache supplied value for ReadmeName and try to view a directory with it.
>Fix:
Yes. :) I've tried emailing this and joining httpd-new and stuff but everything
I've tried appears to have failed so this is my option of last resort. Anyhow...
onto the fix.

This patch is based around the conclusion that ap_find_types is what is used globally
to find the type of a file. This is also what the code for ReadmeName uses and it
does not appear to posses any logic wrt DefaultType and so to solve this problem
I decided to put some logic in there as the presence of DefaultType indicates to
me that there should be no file without a type. If it hasn't got anything specific
set it should get the DefaultType type.

Anyways, the patch is very simple and I believe correct (obviously) but if you
folks find fault with it, please holler. I'd like to know of a beter solution
if it exists. :) Ofcourse, if it's right, please holler also. Any questions and
ditto. :)

But for now... the patch:
