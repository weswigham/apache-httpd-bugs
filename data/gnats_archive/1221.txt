>Description:
In httpd.conf put:
AddHandler SpecialHandler MyExt
Action SpecialHandler /cgi-bin/MyFilter

From browser, ask for Dummy.MyExt.
All OK, except HTTP_COOKIE env variable is not passed to MyFilter.
>How-To-Repeat:
Check with (Dummy.MyExt):
#! /bin/sh
echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo
env

Direct call like /cgi-bin/MyFilter/Dummy.MyExt works well (HTTP_COOKIE set).

State-Changed-Why:
It works fine for me.  Try telnetting to the server
and doing a:

GET /path/to/Dummy.MyExt HTTP/1.0
Cookie: foobar


(with a blank line after the Cookie:) and see if you
get the HTTP_COOKIE variable.  If so, then it is some
problem with your client not sending it for some reason.
