Greetings,

I often just write out debugging/tracing information to STDERR in my CGI
to see the info in error.log. This is no longer working since I upgraded
from 1.1.1 to 1.2b4. I am using the new ScriptLog facility.

This is especially a pain because then I don't see perl's 'die' output.

thanks,
-Robert

Have you solved this problem yet, or is it still unresolved?

No feedback from user, assuming closed.

Note that the ScriptLog will override the output of stderr
to the ErrorLog, so it will show up in the ScriptLog file
and not the ErrorLog file.
