>Environment:
Windows NT SP4, jdk1.1.7B, JSDK2.0, MS Visual C++ 6.0
>Description:
I have installed apache_1_3_4_win32.exe successfully (it runs OK). I then installed
ApacheJServ1_0b2-Apche1_3_4.exe. When I test the install of the server engine, 
I get errors (java virtual machine terminates too many times in 5 sec).
I then noticed that the ApacheJServ.jar file has a length of 0 bytes. I have 
uninstalled/reinstalled both the Apache server and JServ several times with the
same result. I assume that this is the reason for the failure, but am not
certain that there are no other problems.
I noticed a similar report in the report database (although it didn't report
that the .jar file had a 0 length.
>How-To-Repeat:
Try the same thing on an NT system. I am willing to try anything you suggest.
>Fix:
It seems that the ApacheJServ.jar file is not getting installed properly.
