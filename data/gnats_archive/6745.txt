>Description:
The directory listing produced by mod_autoindex has IMG elements
into PRE elements. This is explicitly forbidden by the W3C specification
of HTML 4.01 (IMG, OBJECT, APPLET, BIG, SMALL, SUB, SUP, FONT, BASEFONT 
cannot appear inside PRE).
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
mod_autoindex could generate a borderless table to align elements
instead of using PRE.

State-Changed-Why:

I'm marking this as "suspended" so that it can be looked
at the next time someone modifies mod_autoindex.
Unfortunately, I'm not sure your proposed solution will
be appropriate since there are still browsers out there
that do not support tabels.
Thanks for the report.

 I submited a duplicate (PR 6852). Some info from it: Not only is this
 invalid in HTML 4.01, it is invalid in 3.2 (the DTD autoindex
 generates the page as). Also, the <hr>'s are invalid, as well as the
 <img>'s.
 
 My proposed fix there was incorrect as </pre> causes a line break.
 
 I believe there is another tag in HTML which doesnt imply
 preformatation(!), but does specify the browser should use a
 fixed-space font. That might be what we need.

State-Changed-Why:

Apache 2.0.23 introduces SuppressIcon and SuppressRules
to the IndexOptions directive.  This allows you to turn
off both non-conforming HTML 3.2 aspects.

2.0.23 also introduces HTMLTable output, in primative form,
to allow you to include the images and <hr>s in legal HTML.
