 Nearly all the time when someone says "obviously, this just doesn't work"
 the problem is something _they_ are doing wrong.
 
 Since we have no magic wands to wave to know what _your_ problem is if you
 decline to tell us exactly what you are doing and exactly what you see
 being wrong, we are completely unable to help you.  Please do not waste
 everyone's time unless you are willing to provide information about what
 you think you are trying to do and what results you are getting.
