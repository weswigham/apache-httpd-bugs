apache 1.3.14
>Description:
My aim is to run an applet using a JDBC against a database:

http://localhost/test_jdbc.html

My problem is, how do I set the environment for java jar-files and java zip-files.
I tried this:

setEnv classpath c:/sqllib/java/db2java.zip;c:/.../../interclient.jar;

But I'm getting a syntaxproblem. If I instead try:

setEnv classpath c:/sqllib/java/db2java.zip

It works, but I want to refer several files ?
