Linux paranoid 2.0.29 #2 Sat Oct 18 10:08:38 PDT 1997 i586 unknown
gcc 2.7.2.1
>Description:
We needed to run users cgi's from a directory owned by root, so I added a
compile time option to suexec to allow the dir owner and the cgi owner to
mismatch if the dir owner is root.

Here's the patch:

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for the patch; this seems like a non-general solution
to the problem though.  What is needed is some way to allow
group editing and responsibility, we will admit; the current
model presumes one user, one security "domain".  Then again,
it's certainly conceivable to create a role account for all
those who need to modify the directory and script.  
This is how I currently handle it on a hobby machine.
