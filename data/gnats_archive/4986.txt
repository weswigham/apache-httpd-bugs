>Description:

After building with the automatic configuration, there was an unresolved
linker reference to crypt. There was no libcrypt installed. I got libcrypt
from 
http://www-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/RPMS/uni-klu-suse_5.x/libcrypt1-1.0-5.i386.html
and built it and installed it. Then I added -lcrypt to the extra libraries
macro in two apache Makefiles. Then Apache built and seems to run. I have 
not tested the conditional access features of that may use libcrypt.

I hope this helps.

John
