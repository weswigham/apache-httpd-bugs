>Description:
mod_proxy cannot delete old cache file under Win32 as a result cache stores obsolete files.

The reason of using mod_proxy is to improve performance of my web server. I do it with ProxyPass directive that allows me to cache files that take long time to generate.

Here is a fragment from httpd.conf
ProxyRequests           off
ProxyPass               /images/ http://www.ortv.ru/cache/img/
ProxyVia                off
CacheRoot               proxy
CacheSize               300000
CacheGcInterval         21
CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.01

Everything works perfectly when I send this request to httpd:
GET /images/20020205163724.GIF HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1

The requested file is retrieved from http://www.ortv.ru/cache/img/20020205163724.GIF, stored in cache (proxy/n/v/u/mrcterheykb0w5buhrrzg4h) and returned to the client.

This is http header for www.ortv.ru/cache/img/20020205163724.GIF (I think this is important). This file I request through mod_proxy.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 06 Feb 2002 13:39:07 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.23 (Win32) mod_plsql/3.0.9.8.3
Content-Length: 13013
Last-Modified: Tue, 05 Feb 2002 10:37:24 GMT
Expires: Sun, 07 Apr 2002 13:25:29 GMT
Cache-Control: max-age=5184000
X-ORACLE-CACHE-STATUS: HIT,EXPIRES
Connection: close
Content-Type: image/pjpeg.

Then I send another request:
GET /images/20020205163724.GIF HTTP/1.1
Cache-control: no-cache
Host: 127.0.0.1

Note: no-cache added.

As a response, I get a file, and the error log contains line like:
[error] (13)Permission denied: proxy: error deleting old cache file proxy/tmpa01796

And temporary file "proxy/tmpa01796" is not deleted.

I found this code starting at line 1696 of proxy_cache.c:
    if (unlink(c->filename) == -1 && errno != ENOENT) {
        ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, s,
                     "proxy: error deleting old cache file %s",
                     c->tempfile);
    } 
This really means that we have problem with deleting file in the cache, not temporary file.

When I change this code to
    if (unlink(c->filename) == -1 && errno != ENOENT) {
        ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, s,
                     "proxy: error deleting old cache file %s (%s)",
                     c->tempfile, c->filename);
    } 
I get a new line in httpd error log:
[error] (13)Permission denied: proxy: error deleting old cache file proxy/tmpa01688 (proxy/n/v/u/mrcterheykb0w5buhrrzg4h)

The file proxy/n/v/u/mrcterheykb0w5buhrrzg4h (and all directories) has all necessary privileges for user who runs Apache (really it has full control for Everyone) and no read-only attributes. The file system is NTFS.

As far as I understand from the source code, the result of this error is that cache always stores obsolete files.

I check it under Linux and found that no temporary files appear in proxy cache after described requests.
>How-To-Repeat:
To repeat this problem use my httpd.conf, clean proxy cache, start httpd and follow steps in "Full Description" section.
Do not change ProxyPass directive and use http://127.0.0.1/images/20020205163724.GIF to request.

Please, be attentive, no records appear in error log while http header of caching file looks like:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
