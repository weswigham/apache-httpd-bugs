>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Problem will be on any UNIX environment
SunFreeware Apache 1.3.9 for Solaris 2.6
>Description:
I hit the same fault as described in PR#2612, in that the apchectl script
failed to reconise that the PID given in httpd.pid file is NOT a httpd process
after a reboot, as so failed to start the apache web server.

The following is a patch which should work on ALL UNIX VARIENTS, to test if
the PID listed in "httpd.pid" is actually a httpd process.

This is different to the `hack' in PR#2162, PR#2414 and PR#2285 which 
will fail on some UNIX machines due to different ps command flags.
This version performs the test again if the ps failed (posibily due to not
understanding the SysV -p flag).

>How-To-Repeat:
Stop the httpd server, set the httpd.pid to a PID of come other still
running process, then try   apachectl start.   Server will NOT be started!
