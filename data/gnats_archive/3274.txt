SPACES in Server Root directory prevent CGI script access.
This might be in the FAQ, but I couldn't find it. This
might be in the documentation, but I couldn't find it.

CGI scripts DO function properly when I create a cgi-bin
subdirectory under Directory Root, add Perl 5.001, and add,
of course, CGI scripts. ScriptAlias and other relevant entries,
however, must be updated accordingly.

Marvelous product !!!
>How-To-Repeat:
See above ... try to run cgi-bin entries from
x:/Program File/Apache Group/Apache/cgi-bin

The spaces will prevent access

See above ... put cgi-bin under Directory Root
and don't have any spaces in the path name

 Are you _SURE_ you tried this with 1.3.3?
 
 This should be fixed in 1.3.3.

State-Changed-Why:

If you have spaces in your ServerRoot path, then the
ServerRoot directive value in httpd.conf needs to be
enclosed in quotation marks; e.g.,

  ServerRoot "x:/Program File/Apache Group/Apache"

Likewise, your ScriptAlias' 'realname' needs to be quoted,
and any other references to the ServerRoot in the config
files.  Try looking for these and correcting any places
where they're unquoted, and stop and restart your server.
Let us know (reply to this message and Cc apbugs@apache.org)
how it goes.

 They were and are quoted. vis a vis Server Root, Directory Root, and
 Script Alias ... the following is the one that works:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 httpd.conf
 
 ServerRoot "D:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache"
 #ServerName new.host.name
 
 srm.conf
 
 DocumentRoot "F:/WebPages"
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "F:/WebPages/cgi-bin/"
 AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

 #MimeMagicFile conf/magic
 
 access.conf
 
 <Directory "F:/WebPages">

 <Directory "F:/WebPages/cgi-bin">

 It is and was ... under 1.3.1 and 1.3.3. The only non vanilla action
 was: I installed 1.3.3 right over top of 1.3.1 ... which, as per specs,
 preserved the original config files. It may well BE that 1.3.3 MUST
 write its own config files for the 'spaces in file names' to work
 correctly. I'm just tickled pink that it works fine now.

 Understood, ditto, and see the httpd, srm, and access entries above.

 So does it work for _you_ now?
