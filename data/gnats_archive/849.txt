AIX 4.1.x, vendor compiler
>Description:
The default configuration in conf.h for AIX does not specify any locking method
for serialized accepts.  This results in the behavior described in PR#467.  The
correct #define appears to be USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT.  This resolves
PR#467 for the AIX 4.1 (and probably 4.2) platform.

This also is (IMHO) the correct resolution to PR#197 (rather than the #ifdef AIX
in mod_rewrite.h).
>How-To-Repeat:
See PR#467.
>Fix:
Add #define USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to AIX section of conf.h

State-Changed-Why:
I am concerned about older versions of AIX like 3.x.  They
will need to be investigated, and possibly seperated out,
before changing this.

Thanks for the report.

 I built 1.2.1 under AIX 3.2.5 using USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT and
 ran the server, configured with 4 Listen directives.  Running over
 the weekend with a light load across all ports (~540 reqs/hour total)
 for 3 1/2 days, I didn't see any problems.
 
 I don't know if that's sufficient for the starvation to show, and it
 isn't a comprehensive test of the server, but it does show that the
 server appears to function alright with that #define.
