>Environment:
apache is running on Solaris 7.
it has been compiled on Solaris 2.6 with the gcc compiler
Apache 1.3.12
Apache SSL 1.40
Open SSL 0.9.4
SSLeay 0.9.0b
tomcat 3.1
>Description:
We have a machine which has :
- little ressouces
- used for applications and for apache as well : we would like to prevent the machine from crashing, 
having memory problems,because of many connections to apache.
Thus, we have modified the httpsd.conf file to limit the number of clients which
can connect to apache...
It does not work....
>How-To-Repeat:
Modify the values in httpsd.conf :

StartServers = 2
MinSpareServers = 2
MaxSpareServers = 2
MaxClients =2

Relaunch tomcat and apache.

We manage to perform 8 connections to our servlet (and certainly more...)

No

State-Changed-Why:

Your settings are inconsistent.  If you have
MinSpareClients 2
this means Apache will always try to launch
two MORE clients that are currently needed.
You probably want this to be 0.

In addition, the way to see if these directives are
working properly is to count the httpd processes that
are running on your system.  There should be
one running as root, plus the number of child
processes that you specify.

If you look at it in this way, what do you get?
