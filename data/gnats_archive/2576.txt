Operating system: SunOS 5.6 (Solaris)
Compiler:   gcc version 2.8.1
Box: Sun Ultra-Enterprise
>Description:
When I try to start it, I do the following:
# /usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start
/usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start: httpd started

...but the server does not start

My error_log shows:

Apache is exiting!

I've tried setting the GID to the one displayed in the error log, but it doesn't work.
>How-To-Repeat:
Well - I've tried recompiling it, but got the same error. Otherwise I guess you'll just have to
try compiling and running it on my version of Solaris

What does the "Group" line in your httpd.conf file look
like?

State-Changed-Why:
Change the "Group #-1" to reference a real group name from
your /etc/group file (or whatever the equivalent is on
Solaris) and it should work.  Thanks for using Apache!
