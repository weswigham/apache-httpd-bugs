>Description:
There is an inconsistence betwen de INSTALL file an de HowTo file, of the apache JSERV on Unix systems documentation.
In the HowTo file, when talking about "Build Apache and Apache Jserv", it says that after running ./congifure ... you only have to run make install, 
and in the INSTALL file thats camens with the distributition says make and make install, and is the INSTALL file, the one that it is correct.
Please modify the HowTo file.
