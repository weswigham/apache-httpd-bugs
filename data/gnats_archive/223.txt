>Environment:
BSDI 2.1, patchlevel 27 (i.e. including timeouts for FIN_WAIT_2).
Compiler is gcc.
>Description:
This is very similar to the bug number 23 in the database :
the server runs for some time, then freezes, usually when the load
increases, because child processes are not closed (in the morning, I
find the server frozen with the max number of child processes allowed.
Those processes are several hours old).
I tried to disable keepalives, reduce the timeouts, ... to no avail.
Bug 23 in the database was reported fixed in 1.2b7 : I believe it is
the same and it was not really fixed...
>How-To-Repeat:
I've got no idea how you could simulate this on a regular server.
>Fix:
Nope :( I've got no idea where it comes from. Perhaps mod_cgi, if it
IS the same bug as number 23 in the database

 Have you resolved this yet?
 
 Are you using mod_proxy?

 No, i have not resolved this. I switched back to 1.1.3, I couldn't afford 
 to have my server crash so regularly.
 I don't use mod_proxy (yet), though someone sent me a patch for it :)
 
 I guess I'll have to wait for the full release of 1.2 and hope the bug 
 will be fixed by then.

We've found a bug that could be related, if you could take a
look at the problem described at
<http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi/full/467> and give that
solution a try that'd be great.

Thanks
