>Description:
When submitting a CGI script to the server with the following $ and ? in the same URL, Apache will
not or forget to strip and pass to the Query String (GET METHOD) everything after the $.
>How-To-Repeat:
http://www.xxx.com/cgi-bin/getString.sh$var1?1,5

Everything after the ? are coordinates of an image map.
>Fix:
Have Apache strip everything after $ if it is first there.
Whatever is after the *.sh (either the $ or ? separator) strip and pass it the the CGI.
WebSTAR 2.0 for Macintosh will actually do that.

Thank you

State-Changed-Why:
Erm... I'm not sure I understand exactly what you think
Apache should be doing.  Why do you think it should do
anything special with the '$'?  Please read the CGI
spec at http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ ; just because
some other server has decided to do something different
than the CGI spec is no reason for Apache to make up odd
conventions.

Unless you can provide some reason why Apache should do anything
special with the '$' sign (and the fact that some other
server may isn't enough), I'm afraid I can see nothing wrong
with what Apache does.

State-Changed-Why:
Apache is behaving correctly.

To figure out how you should pass things depends on where
your CGI wants to see them.  Read the CGI spec at 
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ to see what you can and
can't do and try things.

 Hi Mark,
 
 First I would like to thank you for your quick reply. Second I agree 
 with you, still I thought that the $ descriptor was pretty standard 
 among web servers as I have seen many website with $ in the URL. Third 
 to answer my question I would need to know the following : How do you 
 add additional variable in the URL when submitting hotmap coordinates 
 (ex: /cgi-bin/hotmap.sh?12,12&VAR1=aaa&VAR2=zzz) when the default URL is 
 only ?x,y ?
 
 Thank you
 
 Richard Bigot
