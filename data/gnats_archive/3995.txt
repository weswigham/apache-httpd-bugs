>Description:
The INSTALL file says:

     Use the --activate-module=FILE option to on-the-fly add an entry for an
     existing module source file in the configuration file. FILE has to be a
     valid path under src/modules/ of the Apache source tree, i.e. it already
     has to be copied to this location before.

to me, "a valid path under src/modules/" means something like "extra/mod_foo.c".
I had to read the configure script to understand that what was meant was a path
beginning with src/modules/, like "src/modules/extra/mod_foo.c".

Suggested wording:

     Use the --activate-module=FILE option to add an entry for an existing
     module source file into the configuration file on-the-fly. FILE has to be
     a valid path begining with "src/modules/", and the file has to have been
     copied to this location in the Apache source tree before running configure.

Getting even more trivial, the grammar of the error message:

  Error: Module source already has to stay below src/modules/ to be activated

makes me cringe.  How about:

  Error: Module source already has to be below src/modules/ to be activated

Anyway, thanks for a great product.
