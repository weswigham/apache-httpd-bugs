>Description:
in my access.conf, i specify a few options.  i do NOT specify indexes.
yet i get indexes for all directories without an explicit index.html file!
putting "options -indexes" in access.conf does NOT cure the problem.  the
only way i have found to stop it is to put "options -indexes" in an .htaccess
at the top of my document tree.
>How-To-Repeat:
1. create a simple docroot including a directory with no index.html
2. specify options none in access.conf
3. go to that directory, you will get a listing
>Fix:
it used to work, go back to the way it used to be%2

State-Changed-Why:
Indexes can be turned on with "Options All" or "Options Indexes".If you do not use either of these anywhere in yourconfiguration and .htaccess files, please send your completeconfiguration (httpd.conf, access.conf, srm.conf andrelevent .htaccess files). Remember that .htaccess files _above_the document root may be processed as well (e.g. ifyou have one at /.htaccess, for instance).
