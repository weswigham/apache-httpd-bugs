>Description:
[Wed Apr 22 13:16:24 1998] [error] script not found or unable to stat, reason: /prod/pubnix/xdb/libexec/cgi-admin/nph-userinfo
What is the ", reason" doing in this message?  I don't think of the script name
by itself as being the reason for the error.  Rewording would be good.
>How-To-Repeat:
GET a nonexistent CGI.
>Fix:
reword the message to something like:
script not found or unable to stat: /foo/bar/baz.cgi
and perhaps include the strerror(errno) message as well:
script not found or unable to stat: /foo/bar/baz.cgi: Permission denied.
or maybe just use the errno message:
/foo/bar/baz.cgi: No such file or directory.

another good catch, thanks!  I just removed the ', reason'
