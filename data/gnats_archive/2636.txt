>Description:
In the htdocs, the symbolic links works fine. But in 
user's account, the symbolic links are not allow.

The option we had for symbolic links in access.conf is

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

>How-To-Repeat:
We change back to apache-1.2.0. The following is what 
I got from the error logs:

[Wed Jul 15 16:32:23 1998] [error] Symbolic link not allowed: /home/atristan/.ww
w/index.html
[Wed Jul 15 16:32:23 1998] [error] Symbolic link not allowed: /home/ftm/.www/R.g

State-Changed-By: marc
State-Changed-When: Thu Jul 16 12:12:30 PDT 1998
State-Changed-Why:
As you show, the Options statement has to include FollowSymLinks,
however it also has to cover the appropriate directory.
I think you will find that you either have that Options
inside a container that only applies to some subdirectories
or you have more specific Options directions in your
config file or htaccess files that are overriding this
setting.

 Your file has:
 
 <Directory />
 Options None
 AllowOverride None
 </Directory>
 
 The only section setting FollowSymLinks covers only your documentroot, not
 user directories.
