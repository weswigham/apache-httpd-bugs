[Mon Aug 14 12:52:27 2000] [crit] (9)Bad file descriptor: write: rfc1413: error sending request
>How-To-Repeat:

State-Changed-By: wrowe
State-Changed-When: Wed May 30 11:41:18 PDT 2001
State-Changed-Why:
You are observing two different problems.  About the error,
There are no recent reports of this behavior in later
revisions.  1.3.20 is the minimum suggested release, as
1.3.19 and prior contained a security flaw.  Binaries are
available at
http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/

About the missing user name, that's normal, you don't get
the 'NT User Name', you get the name that results from
apache authentication.
