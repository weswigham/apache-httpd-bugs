>Description:
If you install the latest Perl for Win32, it lets you set up filename associations for .pl files.  Do this, and instead of defining a ScriptAlias, use AddHandler to add a cgi-script handler for .pl files.  Your scripts should execute fine, unless you append a GET query to them (as short as just a "?").  In that case, the source code of your script is returned.

This also appears to happen when you add a ScriptAlias.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
A workaround is to remove the association for .pl files.

State-Changed-Why:
[This is a standard response.]
This is a CGI programming or basic configuration issue.
As mentioned on the main bug database page, we must refer
all such basic or non-Apache-related questions to the
user newsgroups comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix and
comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows, or the scripting
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  First check
the FAQ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html and then
pose your question to the appropriate newsgroup.
Thanks for using Apache!
