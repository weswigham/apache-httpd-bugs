>Description:
Try entering "http://www.apache.org/index.html/" into your favorite browser.
The browser should matter (we have seen this on netscape, lynx and explorer).
It is important to include the trailing slash.

What we observe is that there is no such directory called "index.html", and
hence the server should return a NOT FOUND error. Instead, it returns the
contents of the _file_ with the trailing slash removed. That of course confuses
any reletive references in the HTML returned.
>How-To-Repeat:
See description.
>Fix:
Not at this time.

Comment-Added:

No, the current behaviour is exactly correct.  The trailing
slash is part of the PATH_INFO.

State-Changed-Why:

This is not a problem; the server is behaving as intended.
It is true that resources that accept path-info should
not use relative URLs for things like images, since the
client may 'relativise' a result that includes the path-info
as part of the path.  Such resources should use absolute
URLs.
