 And exactly what problem does this cause?  How does it show up?

 SA_INTERRUPT is only defined for historical reasons, but nowadays also 
 used only internally.
 Excerp from Linux Programming Guide (LPG):
      * SA_INTERRUPT: Defined under Linux, but unused. Under SunOS, system
        calls were automatically restarted, and this flag disabled that
        behavior.
 As sigaction never evaluates this flag, it makes no sense to set it.
 Probably removing this flag on linux will prevent from problems with
 future version of the kernel.
 The question is not, why removing this flag, the question is, why
 apache makes a system call with a noop flag. Maybe this is an
 academic question.
 I know, that I currently get the same binary, so you can change priority
 to low.

State-Changed-Why:
Sorry, SA_INTERRUPT will stay.  If the kernel changes the
meaning of that it will break lots of code, not just Apache.
It has a legacy, historical meaning, Linus wouldn't be so
foolish as to give it a new meaning.
