>Description:
Http streaming does not seem to work. My web site is primarily RealAudio files.
I have encoded songs with the RealAudio 3.0 encoder (version 3.0.0.24) and I
have created an .RAM file for each .RA file and linked the .RAM file to stream 
the song. It works when the client is using the RealAudio 3.0 player, but not 
when using the new RealAudio 4.0 player. The error Apache reports is "send body 
lost connection to client". The .RAM file is recognized, and the RealAudio  player 
is launched, but after trying to call the .RA file, it reports an Error 19 "File 
not found".

I'm not sure if this is an apache problem or a linux problem so I am asking 
as many places as I can. So far I have found several people who have the 
problem, all using apache and linux. One other was also having the same 
problem trying to stream RealAudio files, but the other person was trying to 
stream MPEG 3 files, and his MPEG 3 player was giving him the "File not found" 
error, and apache logged "send body lost connection to client".

State-Changed-Why:
"http streaming" doesn't exist; it is just a name that
some clients like to make up to sound pretty.

Asking in as many places as you can is seldom a good idea
since it wastes people's time responding multiple times.

It may be that the client is unable to deal with HTTP/1.1
responses properly.  Figure out what User-Agent it is
sending, then add a:

     BrowserMatch foo force-response-1.0

to your config file and restart your server to see if
that helps.  To figure out what it sends as a User-Agent,
either configure mod_log_config to log it or use
mod_log_agent to see.  This may or may not help things.

If this doesn't work, it could be a problem with broken
byte-range support in the client.  I will take a look
when I can try the client.  What platform are you running the client on?

 This was it! The new RealAudio Player sends a User-Agent of 
 "RealPlayer 4.0". Thank you so much for your help!
