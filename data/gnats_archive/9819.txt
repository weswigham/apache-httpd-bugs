>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows 98 & NT5
>Description:
We use several ISAPI DLLs with Apache 1.3.12 and all work fine. We cannot upgrade Apache to the latest release because our ISAPI DLLs would not work any longer. These DLLs has been written with Visual C++ 6 and C++Builder 5. With Apache 1.3.23, only a few DLLs made with C++Builder 5 work (those have a INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN in the HTML FORM). I can't explain the problem; it looks so strange.
>How-To-Repeat:
I think you just have to try your code with an ISAPI DLL.
