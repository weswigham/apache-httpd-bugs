>Environment:
uname -a says:
SunOS ben 5.5 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5

type cc says:
cc is a tracked alias for /usr/ucb/cc
this should be the standard C compiler for that machine

cc options:
CFLAGS= -O2 -DXXX
LFLAGS=  -L.
AUX_CFLAGS= -Xa -DSOLARIS2
AUX_LIBS= -lsocket -lnsl

Apache info:
Server version Apache/1.1.3.
>Description:
the server does not display the directory index file of / with "document not found".

when turning on the option indexes for the public directory, all displayed files are missing the first 2 characters.
>How-To-Repeat:
I got a .tar.gz file, 
extracted it, 
edited Configuration, 
called ./Configure, 
called make, 
added -Xa to compiler options to compile ANSI-C,
called make again,
replaced old httpd with the new one,
accessed / in Browser,
got "document not found",
turned on option indexes for the public directory,
accessed / in Browser,
saw the first two chars missing on every file
>Fix:
someone else in our house did encounter this problem before in 1.0.5 and made the following change to mod_dir.c in function index_directories():

#ifndef XXX
        if((p = make_dir_entry(dstruct->d_name, dir_opts, dir_conf, r))) {
#else
        if((p = make_dir_entry((dstruct->d_name-2), dir_opts, dir_conf, r))) {
#endif

while the earlier version 1.0.5 was working without any problems after this change was applied, the new version 1.1.3 has problems with content negotiation, which could be related to the fix or the problem.%0
>Audit-Trail:
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed
State-Changed-By: chuck
State-Changed-When: Mon Mar 10 20:24:41 PST 1997
State-Changed-Why:
/usr/ucb/cc is severely broken, in addition to its lack of
ANSI compiance. An ANSI C compiler like gcc should be used.
