>Description:
 I note from a link off the site www.oil-report.com/tech-report/index.html 
 which serves the Medical/Pharmaceutical
 business that you are involved in this industry.
 
 My colleagues have developed one of the first patentable products for the 
 funeral industry which has incredibly
 huge potential (a patent for a service that EVERYONE needs). We are looking 
 for assistance globally in finding
 appropriate distributors/partners/marketing organizations. Can you direct 
 us in this regard?
 
 The site where we found your e-mail address can be located at:
 www.oil-report.com/tech-report/index.html
 What an amazing resource? How do they find so many people jobs for free? 
 They don't even charge employers to
 advertise!!
 
 Many kind regards,
 
 Dr. Bud Maynard
