 Where exactly did you download this version from?  It is not this way in
 anything I can find; certainly not in the 1.2b8 tarball.
 
State-Changed-From-To: open-closed

State-Changed-When: Tue Apr 22 07:57:50 PDT 1997
State-Changed-Why:
Is not that way in the distribution and can't find it that
way in the file the user says they downloaded, so will
assume somehow the mirror or the user's copy was corrupted.
