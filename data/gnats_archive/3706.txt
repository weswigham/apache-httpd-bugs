Not relevant for the problem.
>Description:
Installing 1.3.4 and mod_jserv1.0b2 afterwards won't autoconfigure because
the directory structure has changed from 1.3.3 to 1.3.4.
This means APXS doesn't anymore reside in apache_install/sbin. configure looks
into apache_install/sbin only to find apxs. Thats the problem, patched the 
configure script to look into apache_install/bin (which seems to be the new home of apxs)
works fine.
>How-To-Repeat:
Build 1.3.4 and try to configure mod_jserv --with-apache-install=apache_install
