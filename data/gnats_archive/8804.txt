>Description:

XBitHack behaved as always "on" regardess of any settings.

This will cause any HTML files accidentally chmod +x 'ed to be
processed through INCLUDES filter (if Options +Includes in effect).

This seems to be caused by modules/filters/mod_include.c:xbithack_handler()
incorrectly extracting the module config structure.
The [PATCH] below fixes the reference into "standard" method.

>How-To-Repeat:

.htaccess:
	Options +Includes
	XBitHack off

test.html:
	<BODY>
	<!--#exec cmd="ls"-->
	</BODY>

$ chmod +x test.html

$ GET http://www/~your/dir/test.html

You shouldn't have SSI invoked but actually is (BAD).

State-Changed-Why:
This has been fixed in 2.0.29-dev.  Thanks for the patch!  It turns out that the behavior was always XBitHack 'on', not XBitHack 'full', by the way... in no case did we ever send a Last-Modified header.  I added a fix for that as well.
