State-Changed-Why:
Please try a more recent version (1.2 beta) of Apache
to see if that fixes your problem.  If not, then it is
likely that your kernel is not configured to support
mmap.  Exactly how that is changed is an OS specific 
issue.  Remove the HAVE_MMAP line from the HPUX section
of conf.h and recompile and you can make it work without
needing mmap.
