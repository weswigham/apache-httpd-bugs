>Organization:
apache
>Environment:
Windows NT/2000 using jdk1.2.2 or jdk1.3
>Description:
I have set up apache/jserv so that I can run two seperate servers that have
different classpaths.  The first server is on port 80 with jserv on port 8007.  
The second server is on port 8080 with jserv on port 8008.  If I start each
server individually, they both work perfectly.  However, if I try to start a
second server while the first one is running, the second servers jserv cannot
connect to it's port (It doesn't matter which one I start first, the second
one always fails).  Note:  this type of configuration does work on Unix boxes.
>How-To-Repeat:
Set up two httpd.conf files, one for port 80 and one for port 8080.  
Set up two jserv.conf files, one for port 8007 and one for port 8008.
Run both simultaneously.
Must be run on NT or 2000.
