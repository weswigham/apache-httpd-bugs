 sir,
 
 I would like to know the reason this error crops up. We have installed
 Apache on many servers
 and all of them give this problem even when tested with demo jsp pages.
 Pl. let us know the solution or if you think there is a problem in
 configuration pl. let us know.

 The bug report is still open, and if anyone has ideas, they will address
 it.  I simply closed a duplicate bug that was opened when a misformatted
 email was sent to the database.
