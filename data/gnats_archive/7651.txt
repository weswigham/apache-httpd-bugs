Unixware 7.1.1, all patches, udk 7.1.1b
>Description:
The compilation of srclib/apr/network_io/unix/sa_common.c fails on unixware 7.1.1, 
because of an error in line 440: h_errno = 0;
h_errno is no modifyable value.
>How-To-Repeat:

>Fix:
you must use the function set_h_errno( int ) to set the value of h_errno.
If source is compiled threaded (REENTRENT is set) h_errno is defined as function
"extern const int _h_errno()" and not as "extern int" lvalue.

State-Changed-Why:
Thanks for your report!

I don't have access to a system where set_h_errno() is needed, 
but I have coded the following change to APR which should handle
such a system.  Please let me know if it resolves the problem.
(If I haven't heard back in a couple of days I'll commit the change
and close the PR and you can open another one if it is still not
fixed.)
