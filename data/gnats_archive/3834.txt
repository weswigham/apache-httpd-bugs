Solaris, JDK 1.2
>Description:
the housekeeping thread in JServServletManager.java breaks out of the
loop that searches for expired sessions as soon as it finds a single
expired session - which means that it will expire no more than 1 session
every time it runs - which to most people is the default of 1 minute. 

This makes an easy denial of service attack against JServ - simply
throw a steady (but small!) amount of sessions at it, and eventually
you will EOutOfMemory
>How-To-Repeat:
Launch JMeter at a servlet and let it run for a long time.
>Fix:
remove the break statement from public void run() in JServServletManager.java.

I have tested the *crap* out of this fix. There appears to be NO issue with
removing sessions from the hashtable while stepping through an enumeration.
The fix is simple, stable, and effective.
