A current Debian Potato using their version of Apache.
>Description:
The following directive in access.ctl prevents people from seeing .htaccess files:

<Files ~ "\.htaccess$">
  order deny,allow
  deny from all
</Files>

When I place it at the beginning of the access.conf file I protect .htaccess files but I lose password authentication on any .htaccess protected directories.  If I move the directive to the end of the configuration file then password authentication comes back and the .htaccess file is still blocked.
>How-To-Repeat:
Insert the above into a configuration both before and after the Directory configuration and see for yourself what happens.
>Fix:
If this behaviour is expected, then clarify the documentation.  Otherwise modify the parsing.

Regardless of whether this is expected, I suggest modifying the FAQ to point out that people should modify the access control file to something other than .htaccess, and they should block them since they frequently contain information that would make it easier to break into a webserver.

 Please ignore my bug report.
 
 Long day, tired, and co-worker miscommunication.
 
 OTOH I do think it would be good for the FAQ to explain how to block access
 to .htaccess files.
