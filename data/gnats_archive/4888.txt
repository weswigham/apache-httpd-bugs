This is NOT a bug problem, but rather a request for new features.  I think it would be helpful to have a control panel included in Apache server.  Several functions, like adding e-mail aliases and forwarding, spam blocking of domains, setting up and changing sub-domain accounts, including configuring them for e-mail and/or ftp, adding and changing passwords, sub-domain accounts, and other related features would be a big help.

I became aware of how important this is when I moved from a server that had a control panel to one that didn't and was left at their mercy to complete changes, many of which remain yet to be done.  Adding such features to Apache would only make it more convenient.  I hope the addition of these features will be considered.

Thanks for listening.
