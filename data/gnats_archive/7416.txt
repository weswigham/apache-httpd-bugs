>Description:
Not as stupid as it sounds!

Some FTP servers will tar up a directory for you if you specify
/some/path/directory.tar.  FTP proxy reports thhat you are accessing a 
non-existent file.

e.g. telnet-ing to a host configured to act as a Proxy (but not a cache)

telnet localhost 80
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost
Escape character is '^]'.
GET ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/branches/-current/ports/archivers/bzip2.tar

>How-To-Repeat:
Set up a proxy server and try to download
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/branches/-current/ports/archivers/bzip2.tar
(it's not big)

The "file" will download fine if you do not go through a proxy.
