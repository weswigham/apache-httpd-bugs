>Environment:
(RedHat 5.2) GNU/Linux 2.0.36 i686/233. Compiler: GCC 2.7.2.3.
PHP 3.0.12
>Description:
After compiling Apache (./configure --prefix=/opt/www --enable-shared=max)
all is ok. Then we compile PHP (./configure --prefix=/home/www/php3 \
--with-apxs=/home/www/bin/apxs \
--with-config-file-path=/home/www). All seems OK. We launch Apache... ok
All is fine... until we stop it and re-launch'it. Apache don't start.
Under GDB, we get:
# gdb /opt/www/bin/httpd  
GNU gdb 4.17.0.4 with Linux/x86 hardware watchpoint and FPU support 
Copyright 1998 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
...
This GDB was configured as "i386-redhat-linux"... 
(gdb) run -X -f /opt/www/conf/httpd.conf 
Starting program: /opt/www/bin/httpd -X -f /opt/www/conf/httpd.conf

So, i have no idea what the hell is going on...

Sorry, we don't have public access.

We tried 3 times with 2 different systems and we get the same results.
I have no idea about it...

 hello,
 well good (?) news about my problem. We launch Apache with the:
   LoadModule  php3_module=09libexec/libphp3.so
   AddModule   mod_php3.c
 directives commented, then we de-comment these directive, restart the dae=
 mon
 and it works... fine but this is quiet strange, isn't it.
 Is there a rationnal reason? Have you ever heard about this?
 I hope i don't bother you with this,
 in a friendly way,

 hello...
 and SORRY... we found our error. We didn't update our env. concerning MyS=
 QL
 (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) before compiling PHP... of course no error/warnin=
 g was
 produced so we were so sure about our manips :((
 but we tried with MySQL and PostgreSQL *with a correct env* and it works =
 (of
 course). I hope you didn't waste too much time about this,
 sorry again for the inconvenience, i promise to be less fool the next tim=
 e
 take care, dan
