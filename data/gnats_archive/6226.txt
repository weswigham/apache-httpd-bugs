>Description:
I'm coding something that could take several minutes of background processing so I've tried forking the perl process and it works great in the shell but not under apache.  Yes I've closed STDOUT.  So I've tried to close STDOUT and just tell the script to sleep for 10 seconds, no forking, same results, session doesn't close until the script dies.
>How-To-Repeat:
#!/usr/bin/perl

print STDOUT "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\nHi";

close STDOUT;

sleep 10;
