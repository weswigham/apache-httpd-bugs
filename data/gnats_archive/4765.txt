>Organization:
>Environment:
Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1) Sparc, GCC 2.7.2.1
>Description:
According to the documentation for suEXEC, the only test on the
directory where CGIs are located is "Is the directory NOT writable by
anyone else?". By testing it is pretty clear the group on the
directory is also checked.
>How-To-Repeat:
Change the group for a user's CGI-bin directory to any group other
than the owner's default.
>Fix:
Either fix the documentation (http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html) or remove this test from suEXEC. IMHO I think
the test should be removed since checking the directory's group doesn't appear to improve security in any way.
In fact makes it impossible to have a user's WWW directory owned by a web group, restrict access to
Apache only, and then have the actual CGI programs owned by the user's group (to meet that requirement of suEXEC).
