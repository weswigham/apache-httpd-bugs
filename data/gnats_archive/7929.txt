>Description:
After some hours that the server is running, it starts eating up all available cpu, quickly making the web server unusable. When i try to stop it, i get ALOT of messages of the kind "Child process xxx still did not exit..sending a SIGTERM" and below ALOT of lines like "Child process xxx still did not exit..sending a SIGKILL". I really don't know how to send a backtrace, since the system reaches such a cpu load that anything stops working, even telnet and modem connections. One thing i've noticed that maybe can help...i see that normally there are about 500 processes in the system, with 1 to 5 in "Running" state...one thing i noticed during the problem, is that there are MANY processes in "running" state, even 40 or 50, with the same number of total processes (500 or so)...might this be a kernel issue? The only thing to do to prevent crash is stopping and restarting apache every few hours...which is not good at all i guess...
>How-To-Repeat:
It seems to happen randomly, but heavy load causes it to happen more often.
>Fix:
i wish i had :P
