>Description:
I've just tried to upgrade from 1.3b5 to 1.3.0 and experienced some problems.
I use an access-counter written in C. It is invoked using SSI with the line:
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/access" -->
It outputs "Content-type: text/html\n\n" like any well-written CGI-program.
However it does this *after* checking the REMOTE_HOST and DOCUMENT_URI
environment variables. This may not be so clever, but it revealed a bug in
apache. The access-counter, which has worked fine for years, started to throw
error 500 whenever it was run. After some debugging I found that none of the
above mentioned environment variables were present any more. After a downgrade
to 1.3b5 the problem diappeared.

This problem was reported earlier as PR2294 with a category of os-windows. That
bug report was closed and the bug was claimed to have been fixed before 1.3.0
was released. The problem is unfortunately still with us, at least on the unix
platform.
>How-To-Repeat:
I have downgraded to 1.3b5 so I can't give you a URL. But I think you should be
able to repeat the problem by creating a new HTML page that includes the line
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/printenv" -->
That is the printenv that comes with the apache distribution.
>Fix:
I imagine that you could get some ideas from looking at how PR2294 was solved.

 Hi.
 I have studied your bug report to apache and I haven't been able
 to reproduce it, at least in Linux. A page containing:
 
 <!--#exec cgi=3D"/cgi-bin/printenv">
 
 prints all the expected environment variables, including
 REMOTE_HOST and DOCUMENT_URI. Would it be possible for you to
 send me a page generated by such "printenv" invocation? Maybe
 we could get some clues about the problem from that.
 Thanks for your report and for using apache.
 Regards.

 Hi
 
 I tried to <!--#exec cgi=3D"/cgi-bin/printenv"> myself and, to my surprise, =
 I
 got the same fully correct results as you did. My access-counter still
 doesn't work though. The problem seems to lie in the counter. I'll compile
 a debug-version of the counter and try to find the real bug.

 BTW, that's a malformed SSI directive.  It should be
 
   <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/printenv" -->
 
 instead (note the " --" at the end).

 Hello again
 
 After some serious log-parsing and version-switching I have come to the
 following conclusion which, I belive, should close this bugreport.
 
 In 1.3b5 the environment variable REMOTE_HOST always exists. REMOTE_HOST
 would either contain a valid hostname or, if the dns-lookup failed, it
 would contain the ip-number instead. The ip-number can always be found in
 REMOTE_ADDR.
 
 In 1.3.0 REMOTE_HOST only exists if the dns-lookup was successful. The
 ip-number can always be found in REMOTE_ADDR.
 
 Since my cgi-program relied on REMOTE_HOST to exist and contain a value it
 failed to work properly after the upgrade from 1.3b5 to 1.3.0. I have
 rewritten my program and now it works fine with 1.3.0.
 
 Perhaps a note about this change in environment-variables could find it's
 way into the Apache-docs (http://www.apache.org/docs/upgrading_to_1_3.html).
 
 Here follows the environment-variables for a complete reference:

State-Changed-Why:

Your conclusion is correct. The behaviour was changed
intentionally. Here is the entry from the src/CHANGES file:

 *) The CGI spec says that REMOTE_HOST should be set to the remote hosts's
     name, or left unset if this value is unavailable.  Apache was setting
     it to the IP address when unavailable.
