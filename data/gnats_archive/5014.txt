While trying to execute a Rewrite directive with some regular expression, a message appears
in error log:
[Wed Sep 15 21:50:24 1999] [notice] child pid 7630 exit signal Segmentation faul
t (11)
While PHP's working.
>How-To-Repeat:
PHP 3 module is compiled with sybase support. PHP version 3.0.12. Tryed to compile it
as shared module with both 1.3.6 and 1.3.9, but alas. -rpath is unknown to the compiler, 
while it gets down to php3 directory in modules.
Troubles begin when we use a rewrite rule. the process segfaults with no error, just a notice
>Fix:
If I only knew a way, we'ld fix it by ourselves.
