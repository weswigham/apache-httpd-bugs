Background
----------
I am using Apache on my computer as a development server and to date, I have not had any problems.  My web site will be uploaded to my host's server, which is running Apache v1.3.22 as a production server.  Unfortunatly, my host does not allow me to access the server configuration files, but does allow the use of the AuthConfig override.  The paths to the files used in this report, will be changed to the absolute paths provided by my host, when I upload my site.  The "Docs" folder is the document root and the AccessControlFile is set-up as ".htaccess".


The problem
-----------
In my .htaccess file, which is placed in the document root, I have been trying to get the <Directory> directive to parse.  Here is what I have in my .htaccess file:


<Directory "C:/Apache Group/Apache/Scott/Docs/Secure">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Realm"
    AuthUserFile "C:/Apache Group/Apache/Scott/Authentication/.htpasswd"
    AuthGroupFile /dev/nul
    AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Limit
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    Require valid-user
    Satisfy All
</Directory>


An example of what is in my .htpasswd file, is:

SSweeting:$apr1$dp5.....$krsvMx2kHg4OIhWL9YWIT/
Admin:$apr1$ot5.....$QMvo7.ANKym305bviUwt11


When I ran Apache and acceessed the page, it returned a "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error" error.  I checked the log, and it read "[Wed Feb 27 15:18:41 2002] [alert] [client 127.0.0.1] c:/apache group/apache/scott/docs/.htaccess: <Directory not allowed here"

I looked through the .htaccess file for any errors, but it was fine.  I checked the httpd.conf file and AllowOverride statement in the <Directory> directive for the document root, read:

AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Limit


I then tried the <Directory> directive from my .htaccess file in the httpd.conf file and it worked.  I then refreshed the page and the directory listings appeared.  I then opened the "Secure/" directory and was asked for the username/password.  I typed them in and was granted access to that directory.


I am not sure what the problem was with parsing the <Directory> directive in my .htaccess file.  As mentioned before, I need to specify the settings in the .htaccess file, as I can not gain access to the httpd.conf file on my host's server.


I would appreciate any help you can give me with this problem.  If I can't put the <Directory> directive in the .htaccess file, how else can I have password-protected directories?  I would prefer having the information in the one file, which would make things easier, but if I have to have them in seperate files, then that shouldn't be a problem.

I would appreciate your help.

State-Changed-Why:

Directives placed in .htaccess files are already in an
"implied" <directory> section.  ie, placing directives
in an .htaccess file in /usr/local/ is the same as
placing them in a <Directory /usr/local> section in
httpd.conf.  Therefore, you just need to leave out
the <Directory> and </Directory> lines.

In the future, please ask support questions in one of the support forums described in the FAQ.  The bug database is

Thanks for using Apache!
