>Environment:
HP-UX hab3 B.10.20 A 9000/735 (using standard K&R C-compiler, not c89)
>Description:
Compile (configure, make) ran clean, I installed into the
suggested new standard location: /usr/local/apache/
I made & adjusted httpd.conf, access.conf & srm.conf from templates

(from logs/error.log)
[Wed Jul 15 11:41:42 1998] [error] (2)No such file or directory: httpd: could not open mime types log file /usr/local/apache/etc/mime.types.
open: No such file or directory
Cannot open lock file: /usr/local/apache/var/run/httpd.lock.15147

I corrected the first error by renaming 'conf' to 'etc'
but gave up after the final error and will continue to use
Apache 1.2.4 until an HP-UX binary for 1.3 is available.

 The only thing you have to do is to run
 	./configure --compat ...
 and apache takes configurations files from 'conf' as in 1.2.x
