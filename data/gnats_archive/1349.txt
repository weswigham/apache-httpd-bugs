>Description:
When requesting a URL through a proxy server and receiving a No route to host or "maybe" failing a connection because of (connection timed out, connection refused, broken pipe), the proxy server does not make any further connections, nor accept any from the clients that use the server... this is based on an analysis of the server logs

[Mon Nov  3 05:56:00 1997] connect: 209.132.0.15 port 80: No route to host
[Mon Nov  3 05:57:30 1997] connect: 209.132.0.15 port 80: No route to host 

The server starts working again when I send a SIGHUP to the server.
>How-To-Repeat:
At the time of the last test 209.132.0.15 doesn't want to connect.

Exactly what happens when you try to connect?  Does it
refuse the connection?  Does it connect and give an error?
Does anything at all appear in the access or error logs?

Are you sure this is directly related?

 When I receive an log entry on the error_log such as "No route to host",
 any further connections using the proxy server will time out on the
 client.  (At least from what I see in the log patterns).
 
 > Are you sure this is directly related?
 Not 100% sure.  I am just going by error log patterns.
 
 Another thing that does appear occationally on my error_log is 
 
 [Mon Nov  3 11:06:19 1997] [error] server seems busy, spawning 4 children
 (you may need to increase StartServers, or Min/MaxSpareServers)
 
 However, I have already increased the server from the defaults to:
 
 MinSpareServers 100
 MaxSpareServers 200
 StartServers 100
 
 There are less than 10 people using the proxy server.
