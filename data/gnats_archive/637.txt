SunOS 4.1.3_U1; gcc 2.6.0; EXTRA_LIBS=lresolv
>Description:
When mod_userdir is enabled, requests for ~user will be served even if the
entire filesystem is set deny from all (as per security example). My current 
config as reported by server-info:

Module Name: mod_access.c 
Current Configuration: 
access.conf 
       <Directory /> 
         order deny,allow
         deny from all
       </Directory> 
       <Location /server-info> 
         <Limit GET> 
           order deny,allow
           deny from all
           allow from .jax.org
         </Limit> 
       </Location> 

Module Name: mod_userdir.c 
Current Configuration: 
srm.conf 
       UserDir htdocs

Module Name: http_core.c 
access.conf 
       <Location /server-info> 
         AuthName
         AuthType Basic
       <Location /server-info> 
         <Limit GET> 
           require group cs
         </Limit> 
       </Location> 

With this config I am able to retrieve ~user pages.
>How-To-Repeat:
Should be straight-forward, I can provide URLs for sample user and server-info 
if not repeatable locally.

 Hi Marc,
 
 Erf, I've discovered my confusion. When using the directive suggested by the
 "Protect server files by default" section security of the Security Tips (ie
 without AllowOverride), I am able to override <Limit> from a ~user's
 .htaccess. However with AllowOverride None in the server config file, I am
 denied (as is mentioned in the section "Stopping user overriding system wide
 settins...").  My mistaken assumption was that the default for a
 Directory/Location directive not explicity setting Options and AllowOverride
 was None and None.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to mention AllowOverride
 None in the "Protect server files..." section of the Security Tips as well.
 Also, some mention of the default behavior in the doc pages for the
 AllowOverride and Options directives would be a good thing.
 
 Apologies for the misreport...   Cheers  - Gregg

Subject: Clarification of PR number 637



Howdy Apache folks,

I just submitted a bug report which needs clarification:

After further poking, it appears that the server is denying access to userdirs
with the exception of those explicity overriding the server directive in a
.htaccess file. Using the same config reported earlier plus:

Module Name: http_core.c 
access.conf 
       <Directory /> 
         AllowOverride None
       </Directory> 

I am able to override <Limit> access with a .htaccess in the user dir like so:

<Limit GET>
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Limit>

Cheers - Gregg
